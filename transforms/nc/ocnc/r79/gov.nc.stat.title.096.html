                            Purpose. - The General Assembly has stated the policy of this State is that the compulsory reserves required under the Employment Security Law be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own. In order to carry out the intent
                            of the act its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. By contrast, our courts have said that sections of the act imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of
                            the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>,

                            Liberal Construction. - The terms "employment," "employer," "employing unit," "wages," and "remuneration" as used in this Chapter must be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose to relieve the evils of unemployment, and the definition of the terms
                            as contained in the Chapter are controlling and are broader than the common-law meaning of the terms, and the Chapter includes in its scope relationships which might be excluded by a strict common-law application of the definition

                            Effect of Reinstatement of Liability After Prior Exemption. - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action, and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated,
                            and, additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and
                            that employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances
                            have come about which would justify an upward revision of that employer's rate of contribution. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v.

                            Subdivision (5)b Construed. - Subdivision (5)b of this section is a definitive statute by which it can be determined whether or not an employing unit which is the transferee of all, substantially all, or a part of an organization, trade, or business of
                            another, is subject to the provisions of the Employment Security Law and required to make the contributions as provided therein. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. News Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 332</cite>,
                            45 S.E.2d 391 (1947). But see the 1949 amendment to G.S. 96-9(c)(4).

                            In subdivision (5)b of this section, the employing unit that acquires only a part of the organization, trade, or business of another is expressly exempted from the lien imposed by G.S. 96-10(d) on the assets transferred, although the former owner may
                            not have paid all the contributions due at the time of the transfer. If it had been the intent and purpose of the legislature, in enacting G.S. 96-9(c)(4) (now repealed), to authorize the transfer of such percentage of the
                            reserve account as the transferred assets bear to the entire assets of the transferor, when only a part of the organization, trade, or business is transferred, then there would be no sound reason for exempting such assets from
                            the provisions of G.S. 96-10(d). State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. News Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 332</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 391 (1947). But see the 1949 amendment to

                            Read in context, subdivision (5)b of this section contemplates a transaction in which the purchaser, instead of buying physical assets as such, succeeds in some real sense to the organization, trade or business, or some part thereof, of a covered employer,
                            ordinarily as a going concern. The underlying idea is that of continuity, the new employing unit succeeding to and continuing the business or some part thereof of the former employing unit. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v.

                            Where the three defendant corporations had common officers and directors and substantially identical stockholders, and maintained a central business office where each kept its records and handled all clerical matters, the three corporations were owned
                            and controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests within the meaning of former subdivision (5)d of this section and constituted but a single employing unit within the meaning of the section. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n

                            control or direction over the performance of such services, that they were outside the usual course of the business for which the services were performed, and that the person performing the service was customarily engaged in
                            an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business; and, since the matters of exemption were stated conjunctively, all three elements were required to be shown in order that exemption from the Chapter could
                            be secured. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Jefferson Std. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 479</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 584 (1939); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Coe, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 84</cite>,

                            Before the 1949 amendment to subdivisions (6)(a) and (f), it was held that the provisions of the Employment Security Law classifying and designating those persons who are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, rather than the common-law definition
                            of the relationship of master and servant, were controlling, when not capricious or unreasonable. And the burden was upon the employer to show to the satisfaction of the Employment Security Commission that persons performing
                            services came within the exceptions enumerated in former paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of subdivision (6)f. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Champion Distrib. Co., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 464</cite>,

                            While subdivision (10)a of this section requires a claimant to be "unemployed" as statutorily defined before receiving benefits, neither this statute nor any other in the Employment Security Law requires one to be unemployed before filing a claim or makes
                            filing a claim determinative of the fact of unemployment. Wright v. Bus Term. Restaurant, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 322 S.E.2d 201 (1984).

                            Deferment of Benefits Until Exhaustion of Severance and Vacation Pay. - Discharged employees who are entitled under a contract to severance and vacation pay are not entitled to unemployment benefits until the moneys paid as severance and vacation pay
                            have been exhausted by time elapsed at the employees' weekly wage rate. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 662</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 854 (1961).

                        <p>
                            The fact that the legislature not only amended the definition of "wages" in 1953, but added, in 1955, a disqualifying provision, was clear evidence of its intent to prevent the collection of unemployment benefits so long as the employee had vacation or
                            severance pay payable to him. It was a clear declaration that the legislature did not intend that an employer should be required to provide greater compensation to an unemployed individual than to the same individual when at
                            work. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 662</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 854 (1961).

                            Employee Is Entitled to Benefits If He Does Not Work and Is Not Paid for Services. - A laid-off employee is entitled to insurance benefits under the State law if he is totally unemployed; that is, if he does not work, and is not paid and not due pay for
                            services. In re Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 559</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 393 (1961).

                            Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits. - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina,
                            there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow

                            The United States Secretary of Labor was not a necessary party to an action to determine whether the unemployment tax statutes applied to employees of schools operated by the Roman Catholic Church in North Carolina on the grounds that State unemployment
                            laws must follow federal statutes in order for the State to gain a credit against the federal unemployment tax and thus obtain funds to operate State employment offices and that the United States Secretary of Labor has interpreted
                            the federal statutes to include parochial and parish schools within the scope of the federal unemployment tax provisions, since that action in no way involved an interpretation of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Begley v.

                            Corporation Acting as Contractee and Not Mere Lessor. - The corporate defendant operated a department store. Upon the discontinuance of its shoe department, it entered into a contract with the individual defendant under which he occupied space in the
                            store at a rental of a fixed percentage of the gross and carried on the shoe business under the name of the corporation, with full authority to hire and fire employees and order stock, but under which the corporation required
                            money from sales to be turned over to it immediately as received, controlled the extension of credit and owned all accounts, paid sales taxes and advertised in its own name with the individual defendant paying for the proportion
                            of advertising devoted to shoes. It was held that the corporation was a contractee and not a mere landlord, and that the corporation was liable under former subdivision (4) for unemployment compensation tax on wages paid by
                            the individual to his employees for the period of operation prior to the amendment of 1945. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. L. Harvey &amp; Son Co., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 291</cite>,

                            ESC to Be Treated as Employer. - The reasoning of the Court of Appeals erroneously treated Employment Security Commission (ESC) as an agency appealing its own agency decision rather than as an "aggrieved party" where ESC appealed to Superior Court not
                            as an agency decision-maker, but as an employer aggrieved by the agency action. ESC-employer was liable to pay for unemployment insurance benefits the same as any other employer and had the same rights of appeal as any other
                            employer; thus, ESC-employer had the status of "aggrieved party" under ESC Regulation 21.18(D) and had appeal rights as such. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Peace, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 716</cite>,

                            agreed to remove all sawdust, to keep the bushes down and to pile no brush on the premises of the corporation, supported the finding of the Employment Security Commission that the defendant was not in the employ of the municipal

                            Insurance Soliciting Agents. - Soliciting agents and managers, in their capacity as soliciting agents, are subject to a high degree of control by the insurance company employing them under their written contract, and usually their services are rendered
                            to the company in the offices of the company, and are directly related and contribute to the primary purpose for which the company is organized, and therefore their services constitute an "employment" within this Chapter. Unemployment

                            Private nurse's assistant was an independent contractor and not an employee and thus not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits when she was relieved of her duties, as the evidence shows that the parties did not intend for claimant to receive
                            the agreed upon salary free from deductions and also be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Paris, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 400

                            Salesmen. - The evidence tended to show that the services performed by defendant's salesmen were in the usual course of defendant's business, that goods were loaded on the salesmen's cars on defendant's premises, and the unsold goods returned there, that
                            the salesmen were bonded, were allotted territory by defendant, were not permitted to sell any competitor's merchandise, paid no license or sales tax, were reported as employees in federal returns and their taxes deducted from
                            the payroll, were required to turn in all money for goods sold and were paid weekly on a commission basis. Therefore, the evidence supports the finding of the Employment Security Commission that the salesmen were "employees"

                            of the Employment Security Law during the period in question. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Coe, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 84</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 177 (1953).

                            of a lump sum payment, the driver of such leased vehicle, whether he be the lessor owner or an employee of the lessor owner, was not an employee of the lessee within the meaning of this section. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n

                </h3>
                <p>
                    As a guide to the interpretation and application of this Chapter, the public policy of this State is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this State.
                    Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon
                    the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by
                    the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The legislature,
                    therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this State require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the State, for the compulsory setting aside
                    of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

                        The Employment Security Act was designed to provide protection against economic insecurity due to unemployment and should be liberally construed in favor of applicants.

                        Preliminary Injunction. - Order granting an attorney and her law firm a preliminary injunction compelling the disclosure of unemployment hearings information was vacated because it did not mention the federal regulations concerning the confidentiality
                        of unemployment insurance information and their bearing, if any, on the public records claim; such analysis would be necessary before finding whether the attorney and law firm had a likelihood of success on the merits. Wilson v.

                        the trial court had to enter additional findings and conclusions as to the likelihood of success element, its finding that injunctive relief was necessary to protect the attorney's right to receive hearing notices on a daily basis

                        Whether someone is an "employee" is a mixed question of law and fact. The question of fact is what the terms, express or implied, of the employment contract are; the question of law is whether those terms show the requisite degree of control. State ex

                        This section does not require the Commission to state the reasons for its rulings. In fact, since the appealing party must state the grounds for its exceptions, the mere overruling of the exceptions provides the parties with the reason for the ruling.

                        Scope of Review in Superior Court. - In appeals from the Employment Security Commission, the reviewing court may determine upon proper exceptions whether the facts found by the Commission were supported by competent evidence and whether the findings so
                        supported sustain the legal conclusions and the award made, but in no event may the reviewing court consider the evidence for the purpose of finding the facts for itself. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Paul's Young Men's Shop,

                        The mandatory provisions in subsection (m) of this section are controlling, and the trial in the superior court on appeal must be subject to the limitation that the decision or determination of the Commission upon such review in the superior court "shall
                        be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact supported by any competent evidence." State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>,

                        When, in a proceeding under this Chapter to determine the liability of a defendant for taxation as an employer, exceptions are taken to the findings of fact made by the Commission in accordance with the procedure prescribed, defendant is not entitled
                        to a trial de novo of the issues raised by his exceptions. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).

                        If the findings of fact of the Employment Security Commission are insufficient to enable the court to determine the rights of the parties upon the matters in controversy, the proceeding must be remanded to the end that the Commission make proper findings.

                        Right of Jury Trial Not Infringed. - The provision of this section that the Commission's findings of fact in a proceeding before it should be conclusive on appeal when supported by competent evidence is constitutional, and objection thereto on the ground
                        that it deprives a defendant of his right to trial by jury is untenable, since the provision relates to the administrations of a tax law and the machinery for the collection of taxes, and further, since in addition to the remedy
                        of appeal from the decision of the Commission, the statute provides that a defendant may pay the tax under protest and sue for its recovery. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop,

                        the Commission desired to have the liability of an employer for unemployment compensation contribution judicially determined on its contentions that the employer and another concern controlled by the same interests constituted

                    The purpose of this Article is to provide revenue to finance the unemployment benefits allowed under this Chapter and to do so in as simple a manner as possible by imposing a State unemployment tax that is similar to the federal unemployment tax imposed
                    under FUTA. All employers that are liable for the federal unemployment tax on wages paid for services performed in this State and all employers that are required by FUTA to be given a state reimbursement option are liable for a State
                    unemployment tax on wages. Revenue from this tax, referred to as a contribution, is credited to the Unemployment Insurance Fund established in G.S. 96-6.

                        Required Contribution. - An employer is required to make a contribution in each calendar year to the Unemployment Insurance Fund in an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the taxable wages the employer pays its employees during the year for services
                        performed in this State. An employer may not deduct the contributions due in whole or in part from the remuneration of the individuals employed. Taxable wages are determined in accordance with G.S. 96-9.3. The applicable percentage
                        for an employer is considered the employer's contribution rate and determined in accordance with this section.

                        percent (1%). An employer's account has been chargeable with benefits for at least 12 calendar months if the employer has reported wages paid in four completed calendar quarters and its liability extends over all or part of two

                        Contribution Rate for Experience-Rated Employer. - The contribution rate for an experience-rated employer who does not qualify as a beginning employer under subsection (b) of this section is determined in accordance with the table set out below and then
                        rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%), subject to the minimum and maximum contribution rates. The minimum contribution rate is six-hundredths of one percent (0.06%). The maximum contribution rate is five and seventy-six
                        hundredths percent (5.76%). "Total insured wages" are the total wages reported by all insured employers for the 12-month period ending on June 30 preceding the computation date. The calculations in the table set out below are applied
                        as of September 1 following the computation date. An employer's experience rating is computed as a reserve ratio in accordance with G.S. 96-9.4. An employer's reserve ratio percentage (ERRP) is the employer's reserve ratio multiplied

                        Effect of Reinstatement of Liability After Prior Exemption. - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated,
                        and additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and that
                        employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the Commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come

                        employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the Commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come

                        of the overpayment is less than five dollars ($5.00). Overpayments of less than five dollars ($5.00) may be refunded only upon receipt of a written demand for the refund from the employer within the time allowed under G.S. 96-10(e).

                        equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the transfer, subject to a minimum of one dollar ($1.00) and a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000). The Division may waive this penalty for good cause shown.

                        following the close of the calendar year in which the wages are paid. A domestic service employer that files a report by telephone must contact either the tax auditor assigned to the employer's account or the Division of Employment

                        This Chapter provides remedies for an employer who claims a valid defense to the enforcement of the tax or to the collection of the contributions assessed. In addition to right of appeal from the decision of the Commission, it is provided that he may
                        pay the tax under protest and sue for its recovery. The remedy provided by this section must be pursued in the manner therein prescribed. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop,

                        The remedies provided by this Chapter are adequate and preclude an employer from maintaining suit in the superior court seeking judgment that salaries paid certain of its employees should not be included in computing the amount of contributions it should
                        pay. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 495</cite>, 8 S.E.2d 619 (1940).

                        Right to Raise Question of Constitutionality. - In an action by the Employment Security Commission to determine liability of defendant for contributions under the act, the defendant may not raise the question of the constitutionality of the statute under
                        which the Commission levied the assessment in question, it being required in order to raise this defense that he pay the contributions under protest and sue for recovery. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Kermon,

                        Judgment That Certain Salaries Should Not Be Included Cannot Be Obtained. - A judgment that salaries paid to certain of plaintiff 's employees should not be included in computing the amount of the contributions plaintiff should pay under this Chapter
                        would in effect enjoin the Commission from seeking further to collect the amount of contributions which it contends are justly due, and it being expressly provided that injunction shall not lie to restrain the collection of any
                        tax or contribution levied under the Chapter, the court is without jurisdiction of an action seeking such relief, since it may not do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Powell,

                        Single Employing Unit. - Where the Commission contended that an employer and another concern controlled by the same interests jointly constituted a single employment unit liable for the payment of unemployment compensation contributions and it wished
                        to have this liability judicially adjudged, it was required to follow the procedure prescribed by this section. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 65</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 476, 142 A.L.R. 931 (1941).

                        Subsection (e), relating to refunds, is procedural; the limitation it imposes is addressed to the power of the Commission to make a refund and the conditions upon which it may be made rather than to any limitation upon an action for the recovery of money.
                        It is broad enough in its phraseology to cover refund of money paid through mistake, without raising technical distinctions between voluntary and involuntary payments. B-C Remedy Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n,

                        Retroactive Extension of Time for Applying for Refunds. - While the limitation on the authority of the Commission to make refunds is fatal to a claim, so long as the limitation lasts, a change of law, enlarging time in which refunds may be applied for
                        or made, does not involve any constitutional inhibitions such as apply to ordinary statutes of limitation, and the legislature has the power to apply the extended time retroactively. B-C Remedy Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n,

                                The employer is insolvent and the Secretary probably could not otherwise collect an amount equal to, or in excess of, the amount offered in compromise. An employer is considered insolvent only in one of the following circumstances:

                <p>
                    Benefits paid to an individual are charged to an employer's account quarterly. Benefits paid to an individual must be allocated to the account of each base period employer in the proportion that the base period wages paid to the individual in a calendar
                    quarter by each base period employer bears to the total wages paid to the individual in the base period by all base period employers. The amount allocated to an employer that pays contributions is multiplied by one hundred twenty percent
                    (120%) and charged to that employer's account. The amount allocated to an employer that elects to reimburse the Unemployment Insurance Fund in lieu of paying contributions is the amount of benefits charged to that employer's account.

                        Purpose. - The purpose of this Article is to provide temporary unemployment benefits as required by federal law to an individual who is unemployed through no fault on the part of the individual and who is able, available, and actively seeking work. Benefits
                        are payable on the basis of service, to which section 3309(a)(1) of the Code applies, performed for a governmental entity, a nonprofit organization, and an Indian tribe in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the
                        same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service.

                        Valid Claim. - To obtain benefits, an individual must file a valid claim for unemployment benefits, register for work, and have a weekly benefit amount calculated pursuant to G.S. 96-14.2(a) that equals or exceeds fifteen dollars ($15.00). An individual
                        must serve a one-week waiting period for each claim filed, except no waiting period applies under this subsection to a claim for unemployment due directly to a disaster covered by a federal disaster declaration. A valid claim is
                        one that meets the employment and wage standards in this subsection for the individual's base period. A valid claim for a second benefit year is one that meets the employment and wage standards in this subsection since the beginning
                        date of the prior benefit year and before the date the new benefit claim is filed:

                                Employment. - The individual has been paid wages in at least two quarters of the individual's base period.

                            <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1b2">
                                Wages. - The individual has been paid wages totaling at least six times the average weekly insured wage during the individual's base period. If an individual lacks sufficient base period wages, then the wage standard for that individual is determined
                                using the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual's benefit year. This alternative base period may not be used by an individual in making a claim for benefits in the next
                                benefit year.

                        Qualification Determination. - An individual's qualification for benefits is determined based on the reason for separation from employment from the individual's bona fide employer. The individual's bona fide employer is the most recent employer for whom
                        the individual began employment for an indefinite duration or a duration of more than 30 consecutive calendar days, regardless of whether work was performed on all of those days. An individual who is disqualified has no right to
                        benefits. An individual who is disqualified may have the disqualification removed if the individual files a valid claim based on employment with a bona fide employer that employed the individual subsequent to the employment that
                        resulted in disqualification. An individual who had a prior disqualification removed may be determined to be disqualified based on the reason for separation from employment from the individual's most recent bona fide employer,
                        and the individual must be otherwise eligible for benefits.

                        Eligibility for Benefits. - The Division must calculate a weekly benefit amount and determine the duration of benefits for an individual who files a valid claim and qualifies for benefits. To receive the weekly benefit amount, the Division must find that
                        the individual meets the work search eligibility requirements for each week of the benefit period. An individual who fails to meet the work search requirements for a given week is ineligible to receive a benefit until the condition

                            Policy. - The General Assembly has stated the policy of this State is that the compulsory reserves required under the Employment Security Law be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own. In order to carry out the intent
                            of the act, its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. By contrast, our courts have said that sections of the act imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of
                            the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>,

                            Construction. - Sections of this Chapter imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication or by adding to one disqualifying provision words found only in another.
                            In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968); In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                        <p>
                            The Employment Security Act was designed to provide protection against economic insecurity due to unemployment and should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite>                            260, 311 S.E.2d 372 (1984), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 618</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 223 (1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The disqualifying provisions of this section must be strictly construed, since the main purpose of the law is to benefit eligible workers. The section must be construed to authorize benefits to one who becomes involuntarily unemployed, who is physically
                            able to work, who is available for work at suitable employment and who, though actively seeking such employment, cannot find it through no fault of his own. Wright v. Bus Term. Restaurant,
                            <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 322 S.E.2d 201 (1984).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The disqualification rules must be applied strictly in favor of the claimant. This rule stems from the legislative policy behind the Employment Security Law, conceived during the Great Depression of the 1930's, to provide support for persons who are able
                            and willing to work, but who have become unemployed because of conditions of their former employment, and who continue to be unemployed because of generally depressed labor market conditions in their community. The meaning
                            of this rule of construction and the policy behind it is that where a statutory term is vague, and the claimant is arguably covered, the claimant should be given the benefit of the doubt. Bunn v. North Carolina State Univ.,

                            G.S. 96-14(1) (now repealed) was not applicable to a former employee's case because that section applied to cases in which an employee terminated an employment relationship and then sought unemployment benefits. However, the employee's employment was
                            terminated by the employer; therefore, the controlling statute was G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed). James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).

                            Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) that an employee left work with good cause attributable to the employer because the employee met his burden of showing that his acceptance of a voluntary
                            early retirement package was valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work and that such acceptance was a result of the employer's actions; case law was favorable toward applicants for unemployment benefits under the
                            Employment Security Act, G.S. 96-1 et seq., and the ESC's unchallenged findings of fact were liberally in favor of the employee. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v.

                            Provisions of This Section Prevail over General Policy of G.S. 96-2. - A specific ground for disqualifying an employee from unemployment benefits in this section, "when applicable," prevails over the general policy in G.S. 96-2 of providing benefits to

                            Disqualification for Benefits Under This Section. - Under this section, as amended effective July 1, 1985, a claimant may be disqualified for unemployment benefits, not only for the period of time prior to a scheduled separation, but also for that period
                            of time after the date of a scheduled separation, unless the claimant proves that it was impracticable or unduly burdensome for the individual to work until the announced separation date. If the claimant proves this to the
                            satisfaction of the Commission, the claimant is entitled to full benefits, with only a limited period of disqualification as provided in the closing provisions of subdivision (1). Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor,

                            Ordinarily a claimant is presumed to be entitled to benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Act, but this is a rebuttable presumption, with the burden on the employer to show circumstances which disqualify the claimant, noting that the employer did
                            not except to or attack the statement of the Commission in its decision that the employer had the responsibility to show that a claimant for benefits was discharged for misconduct within the meaning of the law. Intercraft Indus.

                            A discharged employee is presumed to be entitled to unemployment compensation benefits and the employer has the burden of rebutting the presumption by proving disqualification, and taking additional evidence upon remand would allow employers repeated

                            Effect of Filing Prematurely. - While subdivision (1) of this section sets "the time such claim is filed" as determinative in assessing disqualification thereunder, the fact that a claim was filed during the four-day period during which employee could
                            have continued to work for employer and thus was disqualified would not function to deny him benefits after that four-day period, when he was involuntarily unemployed through no fault of his own. Poteat v. Employment Sec. Comm'n,

                            Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits. - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina,
                            there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow

                            Unemployment Compensation Insurance Benefits Not Reduced by Amount of Pension Benefits Received. - Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) that an employee's benefits would not be reduced by the
                            amount of pension benefits received under the Employment Security Act, G.S. 96-12(f) (now repealed) and G.S. 96-14(9) (now repealed), because the employee did not "receive" his lump sum that he had rolled over from the employer
                            directly into an Individual Retirement Account; deference was given to the Federal Employment and Training Administration's treatment of lump sum rollover distributions with regard to reductions in unemployment compensation
                            insurance benefits, and the Administration stated that if a rollover from a qualified trust into an eligible retirement plan was not subject to federal income tax, it was not received for purposes of the Federal Unemployment

                            "Work". - The labor, task, or duty that affords one his accustomed means of livelihood is the type of "work" to which subdivision (1) of this section applies. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648,

                            Student's Services as Research Assistant Are Not Work. - The claimant's services as a research assistant under a fellowship granted to students by The University of North Carolina are not "employment" within the meaning of the Act, nor did they constitute
                            "work" within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                            "Voluntary". - An employee has not left his job voluntarily when events beyond the employee's control or the wishes of the employer cause the termination. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 260,

                            Later Wish to Rescind Resignation. - Fact that claimant later wished to rescind her resignation does not negate the fact that it was voluntarily offered. Whicker v.

                            Notice to Employer That Employee Is Leaving with Expectation of Later Returning. - Where an employee leaves employment because of a temporary disability with the expectation of later returning to work he is required to apply for a leave of absence, give
                            a timely notice, or otherwise manifest an intention not to abandon the labor force. This is especially applicable where the leaving is an equivocal act, as where a pregnant woman leaves her employment and the leaving can be
                            construed either as a temporary absence or an abandonment of the labor force. Sellers v. National Spinning Co., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 307 S.E.2d 774 (1983), cert. denied,

                            The termination of the claimant's studies at The University of North Carolina and subsequently his research assistantship, which was part of a fellowship granted to students, did not constitute a voluntary abandonment of work within the meaning of subdivision
                            (1) of this section. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

                            When Resignation Is Involuntary. - Employees who quit or resign employment because they are asked to do so by their employer do not leave "voluntarily" within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section. Where the employer recommended that the employee
                            resign, and clearly implied that the employee would be discharged if she failed to offer her resignation, this would constitute an involuntary separation. In re Werner, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite>                            723, 263 S.E.2d 4 (1980).

                            "Good cause," as used in subdivision (1) of this section connotes a reason for rejecting work that would be deemed by reasonable men and women as valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Sellers v. National Spinning Co.,

                            Availability of Provision Establishing Good Cause Per Se. - In suit brought upon employee's separation for lack of available work, although some evidence in the record showed that claimant's weight interfered with some of his employment duties, where
                            the employer offered no evidence that the claimant's weight interfered with all of claimant's duties to the extent that there was "no available work" for him, that portion of subdivision (1) establishing the issue of good cause
                            per se was not available to employer. Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 372 S.E.2d 348 (1988).

                            Where the acts of the employer in removing the plant eleven miles caused plaintiff to be unable to continue her employment, since by moving its plant the company caused plaintiff's commuting distance to be increased fifty percent (50%) and, in effect,
                            destroyed plaintiff's ability to go from her home to the job site, plaintiff's leaving work was in response to the removal of the plant and not an act of her own free will, and therefore plaintiff left her work involuntarily.

                            "Attributable to the Employer" - A cause is "attributable to the employer" under this section if it is produced, caused, or created as a result of actions by the employer. Huggins v. Precision Concrete Forming, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite>                            571, 320 S.E.2d 416 (1984); Bunn v.

                            Cause "attributable to the employer" is one which is produced, caused, created or as a result of actions by the employer. It also includes inaction by the employer. Ray v.

         Findings.
        </b> - Trial court erred in affirming a ruling by the Employment Security Division Board of Review that a police officer left work for a reason other than good cause attributable to the employer and was not entitled
                            to unemployment benefits because the Board made two conflicting, subjective findings: that the officer did not believe he had left work and that his employer believed he did; made a number of evidentiary findings that conflicted
                            with its ultimate finding; and did not state that it made the finding that the officer "left work and was not discharged by the employer" by applying a reasonable person standard. Maness v. Vill. of Pinehurst, - N.C. App. -

                            date of scheduled separation was voluntary. Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 372 S.E.2d 348 (1988).

                            For an applicant to be disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to subdivision (1) she must have voluntarily left her position and her leaving must be without good cause attributable to her employer. McGaha v. Nancy's Styling Salon,

                            told that he or she will be terminated to leave and obtain unemployment benefits on the basis that the employee accepted the offer of enhanced early retirement would create an inconsistency and inequity in the law. Carolina

                            Acceptance of Voluntary Early Retirement Does Not Constitute Good Cause. - Unemployment claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits because he left his employment without good cause attributable to the employer, and although the Commission's findings
                            of fact pointed to three possible actions attributable to the employer that could have been factors in claimant's acceptance of voluntary early retirement (VERP), none of those actions constituted good cause for claimant to
                            accept the VERP and leave his employment; the mere offering of the VERP by the employer as part of its efforts to downsize could not be a good cause entitling claimant to benefits in that claimant had to submit a written application
                            in order to accept the program, and claimant left work even though continued work was neither logistically impractical nor intolerable. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n of N.C.

                        The obvious reasons for such a rule are to prevent benefits of the statute from going to persons who cause their unemployment by such callous, wanton, and deliberate misbehavior as would reasonably justify their discharge by an
                        employer, and to prevent the dissipation of employment funds by persons engaged in such disqualifying acts. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357

                        "Misconduct" may consist in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee. Hagan v. Peden Steel Co., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 291 S.E.2d

                        The term "misconduct" in connection with one's work is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer's interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right
                        to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer's interests
                        or of the employee's duties and obligations to his employer. This definition of "misconduct" suffices to encompass an employee's violation of the employer's reasonable attendance rules, of which he has notice, and his failure to
                        give the employer proper notice of absences for which good cause may exist. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>,

                        Misconduct is conduct evincing a willful or wanton disregard for an employer's interest, as demonstrated by the following types of conduct: (1) deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his
                        employee; (2) carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence that it manifests equal culpability, wrongful intent, or evil design, or shows an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer's interests or of the
                        employee's duties and obligations to his employer. Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 313 S.E.2d 176 (1984).

                        Definition of Disqualifying Misconduct Not Exclusive. - The statutory language, "include but not be limited to" in the second paragraph of subdivision (2) of this section clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend an exclusive list; thus, the
                        paragraph added to subdivision (2) in 1989 only illustrates and illuminates the more general language in the preceding paragraph of subdivision (2). Lynch v. PPG Indus., <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite>                        223, 412 S.E.2d 163 (1992).

                        13 weeks if employee was fired for substantial fault connected with her work. The employer has the burden of establishing disqualification. Guilford County v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite>                        103, 401 S.E.2d 135 (1991).

                        Leaving Work Station in Pursuit of Job Duties. - Where Commission made findings that receptionist employee continued to leave her work station after being requested not to do so, but that employee was not aware that her job was jeopardized by this conduct
                        and employee was in pursuit of her job duties when she did deliver messages, competent evidence supported Employment Security Commission's finding that terminated employee was not even partially disqualified from receiving benefits,
                        as she was not discharged for misconduct or substantial fault connected with her work. Guilford County v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 401 S.E.2d 135 (1991).

                        Discharge Under Occupational Safety and Health Act. - Claimant's discharge for willful refusal to wear ear protective devices as required by employer policy made mandatory by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 constituted a discharge for misconduct
                        connected with his employment within the meaning of subdivision (2). In re Collingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 194 S.E.2d 210 (1973).

                        A discharge for "gross insolence" was a discharge for misconduct connected with the employee's work such as to disqualify the employee for unemployment compensation. Hagan v.

                    <p>
                        Petitioner was discharged for misconduct connected with his work as a matter of law: Petitioner's conduct evidenced a "willful or wanton disregard of his employer's interest" and was in "deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which
                        the employer has a right to expect of his employee." Furthermore, petitioner's misconduct, "caused his unemployment," and he therefore was disqualified from receiving benefits pursuant to the statute. West v. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 421 S.E.2d 395 (1992).

                        Where the petitioner reported to work smelling of alcohol and admitted to having consumed approximately five beers that day, and petitioner was offered participation in an alcohol treatment program as a condition of further employment, but refused to
                        participate in the program despite the fact that he knew he would be terminated otherwise, the facts clearly supported the Commission's conclusion that petitioner was discharged for "misconduct." West v. Georgia-Pacific Corp.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 421 S.E.2d 395 (1992).

                        within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section, disqualifying him from drawing unemployment benefits. Lynch v. PPG Indus., <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 412 S.E.2d 163 (1992).

                        The use of marijuana on company property during working hours in violation of the employer's rules constitutes "misconduct connected with his work" pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section.

                    <p>
                        Violation of Attendance Rules. - The definition of "misconduct" suffices to encompass an employee's violation of the employer's reasonable attendance rules, of which he has notice, and his failure to give the employer proper notice of absences for which
                        good cause may exist. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 242 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Where prior to the claimant's going on leave, she was on probation due to absence from work and tardiness in reporting to work; the employer had a known, reasonable policy that provided that medical leaves of absence can be granted or extended only upon
                        the request of the employee's physician and the claimant was aware of this policy; and when the claimant reported back to work at the usual time she did not present a doctor's excuse for the previous day's absence, or to extend
                        the leave of absence, the Commission could reasonably conclude that the claimant deliberately violated her employer's attendance rules. Therefore, the Commission's findings supported its conclusion that she had been discharged
                        for "misconduct connected with her work." Davis v. Corning Glass Works, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 309 S.E.2d 258 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the mere violation of a work rule is not disqualifying misconduct where the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and were taken with good cause, deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which an employer has
                        a right to expect of his employee, or carelessness or negligence manifesting equal culpability may constitute misconduct in connection with one's employment sufficient to disqualify the employee to receive unemployment benefits.
                        Collins v. B &amp; G Pie Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 296 S.E.2d 809 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 469</cite>, 299 S.W.2d 221 (1983).

                        Most courts have held that persistent or chronic absences, at least where absences are without excuse or notice, and the employee has been given warnings by the employer, constitute misconduct within the meaning of the unemployment compensation laws.
                        Obviously, when an employee is absent due to illness but fails to give proper notice the absence can amount to misconduct, not because of the illness per se but because the employee has an obligation to the employer to mitigate
                        any damages an illness may cause the enterprise by giving appropriate notice. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>,

                        When an employee who did not technically violate an employer's attendance policy was fired for abusing that policy, the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, in ruling on the employee's claim for unemployment compensation benefits, had to
                        decide if the employer had imposed a reasonable employee-specific policy on the employee with which she was able to conform and whether she violated that policy, before disqualifying the employee from the receipt of unemployment
                        compensation benefits. Davis v. Britax Child Safety, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 593 S.E.2d 97 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Decision that petitioner was qualified to receive unemployment benefits was affirmed as findings of fact by the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina (ESC) did not indicate there was "substantial fault" under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed) for
                        petitioner's failure for failing to call in sick, as the ESC failed to enter specific findings of fact that the employer expressly warned him that failure to call in was a violation of employer's rules, and that continued violation
                        of the rule would result in discharge. Boyland v. Southern Structures, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 615 S.E.2d 919 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Former employee's absenteeism from her employment could not rise to the level of substantial fault, under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed), because the evidence did not establish that the employee could exercise reasonable control over her actions resulting
                        from her stress related medical problems. James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Excessive Tardiness. - Where petitioner received three written warnings in a five-month period for excessive tardiness and absenteeism and testified that after his third warning and suspension he knew that he could be "let go" for more tardiness or absences,
                        the evidence was enough to meet the statutory requirements under subdivision (2A). Doyle v. Southeastern Glass Laminates, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 409 S.E.2d 732 (1991), cert.

                        Good Faith Effort to Comply with Notification of Absence Rule. - Where claimant was absent four consecutive days after a twenty-month infraction-free period of employment, and a combination of unfortunate circumstances prevented claimant from meeting
                        the strict requirements of his employer's rule regarding notification of absence, but the evidence from the record was clear that claimant made a good faith effort to comply with the rule, the facts and circumstances did not support
                        the Employment Security Commission's finding of misconduct. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d 43 (1985).

                        Refusal to Report to Work. - A claimant's deliberate and unjustifiable refusal to report to work, when the employer has the right to insist on the employee's presence and when the claimant knows that his refusal would cause logistical problems for the
                        employer, constitutes misconduct sufficient to disqualify claimant from receiving benefits under subdivision (2) of this section. In re Cantrell, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 718, 263 S.E.2d

                        Refusal to Work Overtime. - Trial court erred in setting aside an agency's disqualification of a worker from receiving unemployment insurance benefits pursuant to G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed) based on the worker's refusal to work overtime; the worker
                        failed to preserve for review his claim that procedural omissions by the agency violated his due process rights as required by G.S. 96-15(h). Graves v. Culp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite>                        748, 603 S.E.2d 829 (2004).

                        Inefficiency or unsatisfactory job performance does not amount to misconduct. Nor does violation of a work rule constitute misconduct if the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and taken with good cause, good cause being that deemed
                        by reasonable men and women valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 313 S.E.2d 176 (1984).

                        Harm to the employer is not an element of misconduct as defined by subdivision (2), which speaks only of conduct and does not mention consequences. In re Gregory v.

                        An intent to violate a work rule is not equivalent to misconduct within the purview of subdivision (2) of this section as a matter of law. Kahl v. Smith Plumbing Co., <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 314 S.E.2d 574

                        Employee's grumbling and his statement that he intended in the future to violate a work rule did not rise to the level of willful or wanton disregard of the employer's standards such as to constitute misconduct connected with work. Kahl v. Smith Plumbing

                        When Violation of Work Rule Not Misconduct. - A violation of a work rule is not willful misconduct if the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and were taken with good cause. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison,

                        A violation of a company rule will not be construed as misconduct within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section, if the evidence shows that the action of the employee were reasonable and were taken with good cause. Good cause is a reason which
                        would be deemed by reasonable men and women as valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d

                        Work Rule Unnecessary Where Conduct Forbidden by Statute. - Where petitioner, a professional level employee of the North Carolina Department of Revenue responsible for the collection of delinquent taxes, was discharged for failing to timely file, or to
                        request an extension of time in which to file his 1985 and 1986 individual state income tax returns, facts supported the Commission's conclusion that petitioner was discharged for misconduct connected with his work under this section;
                        petitioner argued that his failure to file his tax returns on time did not constitute misconduct under this statute because the department had no rule or policy requiring employees to file their returns on time; however, since
                        petitioner's conduct was forbidden by statute, a work rule to the same effect was unnecessary. In re Gregory v. North Carolina Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 785, 379 S.E.2d

                        The essence of subdivision (2A) is that if an employer establishes a reasonable job policy to which an employee can conform, her failure to do so constitutes substantial fault.

                        Where claimant's conduct was not within the more liberal standard of a substantial fault analysis under subsection (2A) of this section, the court would not reach the question of whether his conduct fell within the stricter standard of misconduct under
                        subsection (2) of this section. Department of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Featherston, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 384 S.E.2d 306 (1989).

                        Substantial Fault Requires Violation After a Warning. - Although claimant's associations arguably placed him in violation of a departmental rule prohibiting dealings with criminals, such conduct would not rise to the level of substantial fault under subsection
                        (2) of this section absent claimant's repetition of the violation after a warning. Department of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Featherston, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 384 S.E.2d

                        Absence Due to Incarceration. - Absence from employment in violation of a work rule due to incarceration for a willful or legally unexcused probation violation amounts to "misconduct" in the context of this section. Collins v. B &amp; G Pie Co.,

                        Conversion of Employer's Surplus Property. - Where the Commission found as facts that claimants had participated in a sale of their employer's surplus property without specific approval or authorization by the employer, that claimants never attempted
                        to see that the employer received the proceeds of the sale, and that claimants knew or should have known that converting their employer's property to their own benefit was not permitted, the Commission logically concluded that
                        claimants' conduct was misconduct connected with their work as defined by case law and properly decided that claimants were disqualified from unemployment benefits. Vanhorn v. Bassett Furn. Indus., Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 377, 333 S.E.2d 309 (1985).

                        An employee's conduct in not reporting directly to his supervisor, replying that he needed at least an hour to go over some papers on his desk, did not rise to the level of culpability required for a finding of "misconduct," considering the supervisor's
                        admission that there was very little by way of information that he had to convey, that there was no urgent need for an immediate meeting, and that he could have conveyed the information by telephone. Umstead v. North Carolina Emp.

                        Evidence that employee left work early and without permission three days in a row, on grounds that his job was finished and he did not wish to disturb his supervisor at home at an early hour, and that he falsified his time records for these days, was
                        sufficient to support the referee's conclusion that the employee was discharged for misconduct. Williams v. Burlington Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 441</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 842 (1986).

                        Protective Reflex Action. - Where student hit child care teacher in the stomach with a book bag, and teacher was pregnant at the time, and teacher's immediate reaction was to hit student in the shoulder to keep her from further hitting the teacher with
                        the book bag, the facts did not show teacher acted deliberately and her actions were more of a reflex. Smith v. Kinder Care Learning Centers, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 362</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 30

                        Assualt upon Co-Worker. - Where worker's assault on co-worker was purely retaliatory and combative, it was the type of misconduct which would disqualify an individual from employment benefits, even though petitioner reacted in the heat of anger. Fair

                        Off-Duty Criminal Conduct. - Where an employee has engaged in off-duty criminal conduct, the agency need not show actual harm to its interests to demonstrate just cause for an employee's dismissal; however, it is well established that administrative agencies
                        may not engage in arbitrary and capricious conduct. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>,

                        In determining whether a rational nexus exists between the type of off-duty criminal activity conducted by the employee and the employee's future ability to do his job, the Commission may consider the following factors: (1) how the conduct may have adversely
                        affected clients or colleagues; (2) the relationship between the work performed by the employee and the type of criminal conduct committed; (3) the likelihood of recurrence of the questioned conduct and how the conduct may affect
                        work performance, work quality, and the agency's good will and interests; (4) the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings; (5) extenuating or aggravating circumstances;
                        (6) the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct; and (7) the presence or absence of any relevant factors in mitigation. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n,

                        Substantial Fault Not Rising to Level of Misconduct. - The personal financial mismanagement of claimant, a legal secretary, constituted substantial fault connected with her work not rising to the level of misconduct for which she could be terminated,
                        as the actions of the claimant, though unintentional and occurring primarily away from her work, had the effect of posing a serious threat to the reputation of her employer, the integrity of his law practice, and his relationship
                        with clients and associates. Smith v. Spence &amp; Spence, Att'ys, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 343 S.E.2d 256, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 707</cite>,

                        The facts did not support a conclusion that in not recording on her timecard 45 minutes that she was dizzy and laid down petitioner was substantially at fault within the purview of subdivision (2A) of this section, and therefore precluded from collecting
                        unemployment compensation. Baxter v. Bowman Gray School of Medicine, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 361 S.E.2d 109 (1987).

                        Failure to Meet Three Conditions of Section. - Where claimant in 1984 was denied unemployment benefits for the duration of his unemployment for being discharged for misconduct connected with his work, and after obtaining subsequent employment in 1987,
                        he again became unemployed, but through no fault of his own, he did not meet the three conditions of this section, and the Commission's refusal to reduce his disqualification would be upheld. Josey v. Employment Sec. Comm'n,
                        <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 295</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 675 (1988).

                        Removal of Computer Hard Drive Sufficient Misconduct. - Employment Security Commission properly found that work-related misconduct was the basis of an employee's termination and properly denied unemployment benefits because the employee removed the hard
                        drive from the employee's work computer and asserted a personal copyright interest in the employer's catalogs and web site without seeking and receiving permission, evidencing a deliberate disregard of standards of behavior which
                        the employer had the right to expect of an employee. Binney v. Banner Therapy Prods., <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 310</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 717 (2008).

                        Misconduct Not Shown. - A worker's failure to notify his employer why he is absent from work cannot be regarded as "misconduct" or "fault" under the Employment Security Law, when the worker is unable to give notice because he is in the hospital with a
                        broken back, and when the employer already has knowledge of his whereabouts and condition anyway. Facet Enters., Inc. v. Deloatch, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 350 S.E.2d 906 (1986).

                        Claimant's failure to inform the sheriff or chief deputy of the phone tap in lieutenant's office was a violation of departmental policy; however, this violation did not rise to the level of misconduct. Rather, given the unusual circumstances, including
                        instructions petitioner received from federal agents, petitioner's failure to report to the sheriff the phone tap he had discovered was a reasonable response to the dilemma petitioner faced. Williams v. Davie County,

                        Decision that petitioner was qualified to receive unemployment benefits was affirmed as findings by the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina (ESC) did not indicate there was "substantial fault" under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed) for petitioner's
                        failure to timely submit log notes; the ESC failed to enter specific findings that the employer expressly warned petitioner that failure to submit log notes was a violation of employer's rules, and that petitioner continued to
                        violate this requirement after being warned. Boyland v. Southern Structures, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 615 S.E.2d 919 (2005).

                        Commission erred in concluding that the former employee's conduct in returning 15 minutes late to the former employee's work area meant that the former employee was at substantial fault for tardiness that justified the former employee's discharge and
                        denial of unemployment benefits for nine weeks; the commission found as a fact that the former employee's tardiness was due to the fact that the employee became ill and had to go to the bathroom as a result, and the former employee
                        could not be at substantial fault for a matter over which the former employee did not have reasonable control, that of becoming ill. Applewhite v. Alliance One Int'l, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite>                        271, 654 S.E.2d 764 (2008).

                        Claimant's former employer failed to meet its burden of showing that the claimant was discharged for misconduct connected with the work because the claimant's refusal to attest on a document that the employer had conducted a complete investigation into
                        the claimant's internal complaint and taken appropriate corrective actions in response did not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to disqualify the claimant from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Burroughs v. Green

                        In passing the 1961 amendment to former subdivision (5) the General Assembly acted within its constitutional powers. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied,
                        375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).

                    <p>
                        Former subdivision (5) of this section was in plain and unambiguous language, and needs only a literal interpretation to ascertain the legislative intent as expressed therein. In re Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>,
                        75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).

                    <p>
                        The effect of the 1961 amendment was to eliminate from former subdivision (5) the means therein provided by which an employee might escape disqualification. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d
                        292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former subdivision (5) extended the disqualification to workers at a factory, establishment, or other premise which supplies necessary materials or services to the plant where the claimants were last employed. In re Abernathy,
                        <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).

                    <p>
                        The disqualification contained in the 1961 amendment to former subdivision (5) involved a question of degree and not of principle. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and
                        cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).

                        Employees who participate in, finance or who are directly interested in a labor dispute which results in stoppage of work, or who are members of a grade or class of workers which has members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of
                        whom, immediately before the stoppage occurs, participate in, finance or are directly interested in such labor dispute, are not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits during the stoppage of work, and each employee-claimant
                        is required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission that he is not disqualified under the terms of this section. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R.

                        Employees Need Not Support Dispute to Be Disqualified. - Employee-claimants who are not directly interested in the labor dispute which brings about the stoppage of work, and who do not participate in, help finance or benefit from the dispute, are nevertheless
                        disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits if they belong to a grade or class of workers employed at the premises immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, some of whom, immediately before the stoppage occurs,
                        participate in, finance or are directly interested in such labor dispute. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 277</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 385 (1947).

                    <p>
                        This section disqualifies for unemployment compensation benefits employees belonging to a grade or class of workers some of whom participated in and were directly interested in the strike which brought about a stoppage of work, notwithstanding the fact
                        that the employee-claimants were not members of the union and did not participate in or help finance the strike, especially where the strike involved, in addition to a maintenance of membership clause in the contract of employment,
                        a general increase in wages, from which the employee-claimants stood to benefit. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Lunceford, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 570</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 497 (1948).

                    <p>
                        Whether the unemployment is due to a labor dispute, or whether it is not, is a question to be determined in each case. The line of demarcation is not the end of the strike but the end of work stoppage due to the strike. That test is applied to all alike,
                        and there is no discrimination. In re Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).

                    <p>
                        For the disqualification provisions of former subdivision (5) of this section to apply, the Employment Security Commission must find that "total or partial unemployment is caused by a labor dispute in active progress." Thus, the only type of active labor
                        dispute which keeps the idle worker disqualified for benefits is one which causes unemployment. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).

                    <p>
                        When Stoppage of Work Caused by Labor Dispute Begins and Ends. - A stoppage of work commences at the plant of the employer when a definite check in production operations occurs, and a stoppage of work ceases when operations are resumed on a normal basis;
                        but the stoppage of work caused by a labor dispute must not exceed the time which is reasonably necessary and required to physically resume normal operations in such plant or establishment. In re Stevenson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).

                    <p>
                        An abandonment of the strike and unconditional offer to return to work by employees who were replaced during the pendency of the strike lifts the labor dispute disqualification. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>,
                        251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).

                    <p>
                        An employer's inability to reinstate previously replaced employees after they abandoned their strike and unconditionally offered to return to work changed the cause of unemployment and lifted the disqualification for benefits In re Sarvis,
                        <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Effect of NLRB Proceedings on Labor Dispute Disqualification. - An election petition and an unfair labor practice charge pending before the National Labor Relations Board after the end of employees' strike did not keep the labor dispute disqualification
                        in effect after the conclusion of the strike. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).

                        A "labor dispute" includes work stoppage caused by management lockouts. In re Usery, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 230 S.E.2d 585 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 265</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 396

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof. - Where the employer resists recovery of unemployment compensation on the ground that claimants' unemployment was due to a work stoppage resulting from a labor dispute, each claimant is required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission
                        that he is not disqualified for benefits. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 403 (1950).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Resume Work After Dispute. - The evidence tended to show that employee-claimants not only did not work during the period of stoppage of work at the employer's plant caused by a labor dispute but also that they did not resume work after operations
                        at the plant were resumed, and after notification by the employer that jobs were available. There was also evidence on behalf of claimants that they did not return to their jobs because of the labor dispute. The Commission ruled
                        that claimants were not entitled to benefits during the stoppage of work. It was held that the employer is not prejudiced by the further order of the Commission that the eligibility of claimants to benefits subsequent to the resumption
                        of operations at the plant should be determined, since it must be presumed the Commission will determine eligibility of each claimant for such benefits in accordance with objective standards or criteria set up in this Chapter,
                        but the existence and effect of a labor dispute may have an essential bearing upon the eligibility of claimants, the suitableness of work offered, and the disqualifications for benefits. In re Steelman,
                        <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941).

                    <p>
                        Notice That Due to Labor Dispute Employees Might Seek Other Employment. - A finding that after a strike which closed the plant and after the employer's attempt to resume operations had proved futile, the employer posted a notice stating that all operations
                        at the mill would cease for an indefinite period and that employees were free to seek employment elsewhere, was held insufficient to support a conclusion of law by the Commission that subsequent to the posting of the notice the
                        unemployment of claimants was not due to stoppage of work because of a labor dispute, since the notice merely signified the willingness of the employer to terminate its employment relationship with any worker who elected to withdraw
                        from the existing labor dispute and seek work elsewhere, but did not alter the status of any employee who refrained from exercising this option. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>,

                            The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide benefits to a person who is physically unable to work or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable
                            and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319

                            A person who must quit a job for health reasons but who is available for other employment is clearly not a person envisioned by this language. Both reason and justice demand that such a claimant receive unemployment benefits. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin,
                            <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).

                            Construction. - This section and G.S. 96-14 (now repealed) as cognate statutes provide the overall formula governing the right to unemployment compensation benefits. Being thus in pari materia, they are to be construed together. In re Miller,
                            <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                            Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits. - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina,
                            there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow

                        <p>
                            "Able to Work". - The terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" are not precise terms capable of application with mathematical precision. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513,
                            186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972); In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>,
                            210 S.E.2d 193 (1974). See also, In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The words "available for work" in this section mean "available for suitable work" in the same sense as the words "suitable work" are used in G.S. 96-14 (now repealed). In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>,
                            91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The phrase "available for work" is not susceptible of precise definition, and whether a person is available for work differs according to the facts of each individual case. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>,
                            210 S.E.2d 193 (1974); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Availability requirement is said to be satisfied when an individual is willing, able and ready to accept suitable work which he does not have good cause to refuse, that is, when he is generally attached to the labor market. In re Beatty,
                            <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be available for work a person must be in such a position that prospective employers will hire him for work which he is capable of performing. In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658
                            (1979).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For meaning of "available for work," see In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A petitioner is not required to be available for work at all times. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            This section forbids denial of unemployment benefits solely because of school enrollment and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where petitioner was both a full-time student and a full-time employee when she was laid off from work, she could not be denied unemployment benefits if she was "otherwise eligible" to receive those benefits, and in determining whether she was otherwise
                            eligible for benefits, this section required that she not be denied benefits because of school enrollment and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                            142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A claimant refusing to consider employment during her Sabbath did not render herself unavailable for work within the meaning of this section. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Large measure of administrative discretion must be granted to the Employment Security Commission in applying the terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" to specific cases. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite>                            563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Restrictions Claimant Places on His Employment. - It is essentially a matter of degree to ascertain to what extent a claimant can impose restrictions and on what these restrictions must be based. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>,
                            210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem is whether or not the restrictions which the claimant places on his employment serve to limit the work which a claimant can accept to such a degree that he is no longer genuinely attached to the labor force. In re Beatty,
                            <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                            Labor Market to Be Described in Terms of Individual. - Since, under unemployment compensation laws, it is the availability of an individual that is required to be tested, the labor market must be described in terms of the individual. In re Beatty,
                            <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                            Significance of Claimant's Age in Determining Labor Market. - For a case discussing the significance of the fact that employers in a locality do not customarily employ persons of claimant's advanced age, see In re Thomas,
                            <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).

                        <p>
                            Claimant's Burden of Proof. - A claimant in an appeals hearing has the burden of proving that he is not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite>                            553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Quantum of Proof of Availability for Work. - The Commission erred in requiring a 70-year-old claimant to show by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that she had reentered the labor force after having voluntarily retired from her job as a laundry worker.
                            Under former G.S. 143-318(1), the claimant had the burden to show that she was "available for work" only by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>,
                            189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).

                            Duty to Assist Claimant Appearing Without Counsel. - The Commission is not required to notify a claimant of the specific facts that he will be required to establish or to prove the claimant's case for him. However, the Commission does have the responsibility
                            to conduct its hearings in a manner that allows a party the opportunity to make the required showing. Especially in the case of an uncounseled claimant, the Commission's responsibility involves asking the right questions. Hoke
                            v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).

                            Improper to Disqualify Pro Se Claimant Where Referee Did Not Ask Relevant Questions. - It was not appropriate for the Commission to disqualify a pro se claimant from receiving benefits because she failed to produce evidence of facts that case law from
                            other states says she must establish when the appeals referee never even asked her the relevant questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254
                            (1985).

                            Where the Commission's findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence in the record, the Supreme Court is bound by the Commission's findings of fact. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d
                            193 (1974).

                            Evidence Showing Failure to Actively Seek Work. - Evidence that during a period of six months claimant's efforts to obtain employment, in addition to reporting to the employment service office, were limited to two occasions at one mill and one occasion

                            Plant Shut Down for Additional Week of Vacation. - Where an employer, in addition to one week paid vacation provided for in the contract, shuts down its plant for an additional week of vacation during the Christmas period, its employees are not entitled
                            to unemployment compensation for the additional week under this section. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).

                            By their adherence to the terms of the guaranteed annual income provisions of their collective bargaining agreement, claimants placed themselves in a position which, for all practical purposes, eliminated their availability for work in contravention of
                            the requirements of subdivision (a)(3) of this section. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                            Commission erred in awarding unemployment benefits without making a finding as required by subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) that claimant had registered for work and continued to report to an employment office and that he had made a claim for benefits in
                            accordance with G.S. 96-15(a). The Commission's finding that three separate claim series were started for claimant was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements.

                            my sentence will be," the Commission could conclude from this that claimant was not in such a position that prospective employers would hire him and that he was not "available for work." In re Yarboro,

       § 96-14.10. Disciplinary suspension.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The disciplinary suspension of an employee for 30 or fewer consecutive calendar days does not constitute good cause for leaving work. An individual who is on suspension is not available for work and is not eligible for benefits for any week during any
                    part of the disciplinary suspension. If the disciplinary suspension exceeds 30 days, the individual is considered to have been discharged from work because of the acts or omissions that caused the suspension and the issue is whether
                    the discharge was for disqualifying reasons. During the period of suspension of 30 or fewer days, the individual is considered to be attached to the employer's payroll, and the issue of separation from work is held in abeyance until
                    a claim is filed for a week to which this section does not apply.

                    <p>
                        The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide benefits to a person who is physically unable to work or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable
                        and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d

                        A person who must quit a job for health reasons but who is available for other employment is clearly not a person envisioned by this language. Both reason and justice demand that such a claimant receive unemployment benefits. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).

                        Construed with G.S. 96-14. - This section and G.S. 96-14 (now repealed) as cognate statutes provide the overall formula governing the right to unemployment compensation benefits. Being thus in pari materia, they are to be construed together. In re Miller,
                        <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                        Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits. - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina,
                        there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow v. Holland

                    <p>
                        "Able to Work". - The terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" are not precise terms capable of application with mathematical precision. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513,
                        186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972); In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The words "available for work" mean "available for suitable work" in the same sense as the words "suitable work" are used in G.S. 96-14 (now repealed). In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956);
                        In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "available for work" is not susceptible of precise definition, and whether a person is available for work differs according to the facts of each individual case. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>,
                        210 S.E.2d 193 (1974); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Availability requirement is said to be satisfied when an individual is willing, able and ready to accept suitable work which he does not have good cause to refuse, that is, when he is generally attached to the labor market. In re Beatty,
                        <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                        To be available for work a person must be in such a position that prospective employers will hire him for work which he is capable of performing. In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).

                        Where petitioner was both a full-time student and a full-time employee when she was laid off from work, she could not be denied unemployment benefits if she was "otherwise eligible" to receive those benefits, and in determining whether she was otherwise
                        eligible for benefits, this section required that she not be denied benefits because of school enrollment and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142,

                        The problem is whether or not the restrictions which the claimant places on his employment serve to limit the work which a claimant can accept to such a degree that he is no longer genuinely attached to the labor force. In re Beatty,

                        Labor Market to Be Described in Terms of Individual. - Since, under unemployment compensation laws, it is the availability of an individual that is required to be tested, the labor market must be described in terms of the individual. In re Beatty,
                        <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).

                        Significance of Claimant's Age in Determining Labor Market. - For a case discussing the significance of the fact that employers in a locality do not customarily employ persons of claimant's advanced age, see In re Thomas,
                        <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Claimant's Burden of Proof. - A claimant in an appeals hearing has the burden of proving that he is not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite>                        553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Quantum of Proof of Availability for Work. - The Commission erred in requiring a 70-year-old claimant to show by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that she had reentered the labor force after having voluntarily retired from her job as a laundry worker.
                        Under former G.S. 143-318(1), the claimant had the burden to show that she was "available for work" only by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189
                        S.E.2d 245 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Duty to Assist Claimant Appearing Without Counsel. - The Commission is not required to notify a claimant of the specific facts that he will be required to establish or to prove the claimant's case for him. However, the Commission does have the responsibility
                        to conduct its hearings in a manner that allows a party the opportunity to make the required showing. Especially in the case of an uncounseled claimant, the Commission's responsibility involves asking the right questions. Hoke
                        v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Improper to Disqualify Pro Se Claimant Where Referee Did Not Ask Relevant Questions. - It was not appropriate for the Commission to disqualify a pro se claimant from receiving benefits because she failed to produce evidence of facts that case law from
                        other states says she must establish when the appeals referee never even asked her the relevant questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).

                        Where the Commission's findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence in the record, the Supreme Court is bound by the Commission's findings of fact. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193
                        (1974).

                    <p>
                        Evidence Showing Failure to Actively Seek Work. - Evidence that during a period of six months claimant's efforts to obtain employment, in addition to reporting to the employment service office, were limited to two occasions at one mill and one occasion
                        at each of three other mills, is sufficient to sustain the Commission's finding that he had failed to show that he had been actively seeking work within the purview of this section. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts,
                        <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).

                    <p>
                        Vacation Periods. - The statute does not prescribe; it merely limits the total vacation period for which an employee is ineligible for compensation to a total of two weeks. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>,
                        101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).

                    <p>
                        Plant Shut Down for Additional Week of Vacation. - Where an employer, in addition to one week paid vacation provided for in the contract, shuts down its plant for an additional week of vacation during the Christmas period, its employees are not entitled
                        to unemployment compensation for the additional week under this section. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By their adherence to the terms of the guaranteed annual income provisions of their collective bargaining agreement, claimants placed themselves in a position which, for all practical purposes, eliminated their availability for work in contravention of
                        the requirements of this section. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commission erred in awarding unemployment benefits without making a finding that claimant had registered for work and continued to report to an employment office and that he had made a claim for benefits in accordance with G.S. 96-15(a). The Commission's
                        finding that three separate claim series were started for claimant was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. In re George, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 490, 256 S.E.2d 826 (1979).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Claimant Not Available While Awaiting Sentencing. - Where a claimant for unemployment compensation pleaded guilty to a charge of selling a controlled substance and testified that he was not hired because prospective employers were "waiting to see what
                        my sentence will be," the Commission could conclude from this that claimant was not in such a position that prospective employers would hire him and that he was not "available for work." In re Yarboro,
                        <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).

                        Employee of Project Headstart. - Project Headstart is a school within the ordinary meaning of the term, and the situation of an employee of Project Headstart is one of those addressed by the "secondary school provision" of this section, excluding from
                        unemployment benefits those who are subject to school-related seasonal unemployment. In re Huntley, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 255 S.E.2d 574, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>,

                            "Unsuitable" Work May Become "Suitable". - Work which may be deemed "unsuitable" at the inception of the claimant's unemployment and for a reasonable time thereafter, because it pays less than his prior earning capacity, may thereafter become "suitable"
                            work when consideration is given to the length of unemployment and the prospects for obtaining customary work at his prior earning capacity. What is a "reasonable time" is not rigid and inflexible and it must initially be determined
                            as a question of fact under the peculiar circumstances of each individual case. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                            A claimant is entitled to a reasonable length of time within which to find work at his higher skill before work calling for less competence and lower remuneration can be found to be suitable. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>,

                            But the longer a claimant is unemployed, the more he is obligated to take less desirable work and to make himself available to take it. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                            Elements Which Must Be Considered in Determining "Suitable Work". - The skill and capacity of the worker, his accustomed remuneration, his expectancy of obtaining equivalent employment, and the time which he had had to obtain it may be taken into account
                            in determining "suitable work." In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                        <p>
                            It may reasonably be thought that employment which requires a highly trained and skilled worker, who still has a fair prospect of securing work in his own line to step down into work of a substantially lower grade, at substantially less pay, before he
                            has had a chance to look about him, is not truly "suitable." Acceptance of such employment might conceivably condemn the worker permanently to a scale of employment lower than that to which his training, skill, and industry
                            fairly entitled him. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

                            Distance from Residence Must Be Considered. - The determination of whether the work offered a claimant is suitable requires a consideration of several factors, including the distance of the available work from the employee's residence. Housecalls Nursing

                <p>
                    An individual is disqualified from receiving benefits for any week for which the individual receives any sum from the employer pursuant to an order of a court, the National Labor Relations Board, or another adjudicative agency or by private agreement,
                    consent, or arbitration for loss of pay by reason of discharge. When the employer pays a lump sum that covers a period of more than one week, the amount paid is allocated to the weeks in the period on a pro rata basis as determined
                    by the Division. If the amount prorated to a week would, if it had been earned by the individual during that week of unemployment, have resulted in a reduced benefit payment as provided in G.S. 96-14.2, the individual is entitled to
                    receive the reduced payment if the individual is otherwise eligible for benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits paid for weeks of unemployment for which back pay awards or other similar compensation are made constitutes an overpayment of benefits. The employer must deduct the overpayment from the award prior to payment to the employee and must send the
                    overpayment to the Division within five days of the payment for application against the overpayment. Overpayments not remitted to the Division are subject to the same collection procedures as contributions. The removal of charges made
                    against the employer's account as a result of the previously paid benefits applies to the calendar year in which the Division receives the overpayment.

                        to the nearest lower full dollar amount (if not a full dollar amount). Provided, that for any week during a period in which federal payments to states under Section 204 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act
                        of 1970, P.L. 91-373, are reduced under an order issued under Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, P.L. 99-177, the weekly extended benefit amount payable to an individual for a week of
                        total unemployment in his eligibility period shall be reduced by a percentage equivalent to the percentage of the reduction in the federal payment. The reduced weekly extended benefit amount, if not a full dollar amount, shall
                        be rounded to the nearest lower full dollar amount.

                        Appeals. - Unless an appeal from the adjudicator is withdrawn, an appeals referee or hearing officer shall set a hearing in which the parties are given reasonable opportunity to be heard. The conduct of hearings shall be governed by suitable rules adopted
                        by the Division. The rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence or technical or formal rules of procedure but shall provide for the conduct of hearings in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights
                        of the parties. The hearings may be conducted by conference telephone call or other similar means provided that if any party files with the Division prior written objection to the telephone procedure, that party will be afforded
                        an opportunity for an in-person hearing at such place in the State as the Division by rule shall provide. The hearing shall be scheduled for a time that, as much as practicable, least intrudes on and reasonably accommodates the
                        ordinary business activities of an employer and the return to employment of a claimant. The appeals referee or hearing officer may affirm or modify the conclusion of the adjudicator or issue a new decision in which findings of
                        fact and conclusions of law will be set out or dismiss an appeal when the appellant fails to appear at the appeals hearing to prosecute the appeal after having been duly notified of the appeals hearing. The evidence taken at the
                        hearings before the appeals referee shall be recorded and the decision of the appeals referee shall be deemed to be the final decision of the Division unless within 10 days after the date of notification or mailing of the decision,
                        whichever is earlier a written appeal is filed pursuant to such rules as the Board of Review and the Division may adopt. No person may be appointed as an appeals referee or hearing officer unless he or she possesses the minimum
                        qualifications necessary to be a staff attorney eligible for designation by the Division as a hearing officer under G.S. 96-4(q). No appeals referee or hearing officer in full-time permanent status may engage in the private practice
                        of law as defined in G.S. 84-2.1 while serving in office as appeals referee or hearing officer; violation of this prohibition shall be grounds for removal. Whenever an appeal is taken from a decision of the appeals referee or hearing
                        officer, the appealing party shall submit a clear written statement containing the grounds for the appeal within the time allowed by law for taking the appeal, and if such timely statement is not submitted, the Board of Review
                        may dismiss the appeal.

                        The requirements of this section are mandatory and not directory. They are conditions precedent to obtaining a review by the courts and must be observed. Noncompliance therewith requires dismissal. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n,
                        <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 651</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 311 (1951).

                        In considering an appeal from a decision of the Employment Security Commission, the reviewing court must (1) determine whether there was evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact and (2) decide whether the facts found sustain the
                        Commission's conclusions of law and its resulting decision. Miller v. Guilford County Schools, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 729, 303 S.E.2d 411, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 321</cite>,

                        Appeal to Superior Court. - Under subsection (a) of G.S. 96-4 the chairman of the Employment Security Commission is vested with all authority of the Commission, and where it appears that a claim was heard on appeal by the chairman, and that claimant appealed
                        therefrom "to the full Commission or to the superior court," the hearing of the appeal by the superior court was in accordance with the statute. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>,
                        52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).

                        Employee's petition to review an unemployment compensation denial was properly dismissed because (1) G.S. 96-15(h) required the petition's actual delivery, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Civ. P. 4, rather than mailing under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 5, as the statute required "certified mail, return receipt requested,"
                        emphasizing actual delivery and closely mirroring G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j), and (2) the petition was not delivered. Isenberg v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 772 S.E.2d 97 (2015), review denied,

                    <p>
                        Appeal by Commission. - Under this section the exact status of the Commission as a party to an action is not defined and the part it is to play as such is left somewhat in the realm of speculation, and there is nothing which constitutes the Commission
                        guardian or trustee for a claimant or which would warrant the conclusion that it is authorized to prosecute an appeal from a judgment against a claimant when the claimant is content. Nor may it do so for the purpose of adjudicating
                        issues which are merely incidental to the claimant's cause of action. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 65</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 476, 142 A.L.R. 931 (1941). But see G.S. 96-15(h) and (i).

                    <p>
                        ESC as Employer with Appeal Rights. - The reasoning of the Court of Appeals erroneously treated Employment Security Commission (ESC) as an agency appealing its own agency decision rather than as an "aggrieved party" where ESC appealed to Superior Court
                        not as an agency decision-maker, but as an employer aggrieved by the agency action. As ESC-employer was liable to pay for unemployment insurance benefits the same as any other employer and had the same rights of appeal as any other
                        employer; thus ESC-employer had the status of "aggrieved party" under ESC Regulation 21.18(D) and had appeal rights as such. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Peace, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 716</cite>, 462
                        S.E.2d 222 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Scope of Superior Court's Jurisdiction. - The superior court's jurisdiction in reviewing the Commission's decisions is severely limited. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978). See also,
                        In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The function of the superior court in reviewing a decision of the Employment Security Commission is twofold: (1) To determine whether there was evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact; and (2) to decide whether the facts found sustain
                        the conclusions of law and the resultant decision of the Commission. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978); Hester v. Hanes Knitwear, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite>                        730, 301 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 676</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 755 (1983).

                    <p>
                        The legislature, in granting jurisdiction under subsection (i) of this section to the superior court, intended the superior court to function as an appellate court. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243
                        S.E.2d 388 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that the superior court accepted additional evidence in hearing claimant's appeal from the decision of the Commission required a reversal of its decision. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243
                        S.E.2d 388 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in setting aside an agency's disqualification of a worker from receiving unemployment insurance benefits pursuant to G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed) based on the worker's refusal to work overtime; the worker failed to preserve for review
                        his claim that procedural omissions by the agency violated his due process rights as required by G.S. 96-15(h). Graves v. Culp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 748, 603 S.E.2d 829 (2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the trial court did not rule on the merits of an employee's claim for unemployment benefits, but found that the Employment Security Commission's order did not address all of the relevant issues raised by the record, and the findings were incomplete
                        and failed to set out the sequence of events regarding the timing and notification of the employee's discharge, the order was clearly interlocutory; hence, without evidence that the employee's substantial rights were affected,
                        or that any criteria for an immediate appeal was required, the employee's appeal was dismissed. Reeves v. Yellow Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 613 S.E.2d 350, review denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 853</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 511 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because a former employee made no exceptions to the findings made by the Employment Security Commission, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider that issue, and the trial court compounded its error by relying upon the appeals referee decision
                        rendered in favor of a co-worker; the trial court erred in reversing the Commission. Woodle v. Onslow County ABC Bd., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 631 S.E.2d 199 (2006).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The scope of judicial review of appeals from decisions of the Employment Security Commission is a determination of whether the facts found by the Commission are supported by competent evidence and, if so, whether the findings support the conclusions of
                        law. The reviewing court may not consider the evidence to find the facts itself. Baptist Children's Homes of N.C. Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 781, 290 S.E.2d
                        402 (1982); Phillips v. Kincaid Furn. Co., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 313 S.E.2d 19 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The scope of appellate court review of decisions of the Commission is a determination of whether the facts found by the Commission are supported by competent evidence and, if so, whether the findings support the conclusions of law. Reco Transp., Inc.
                        v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 344 S.E.2d 294, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 509</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in affirming a ruling by the Employment Security Division Board of Review that a police officer left work for a reason other than good cause attributable to the employer and was not entitled to unemployment benefits because the Board
                        made two conflicting, subjective findings: that the officer did not believe he had left work and that his employer believed he did; made a number of evidentiary findings that conflicted with its ultimate finding; and did not state
                        that it made the finding that the officer "left work and was not discharged by the employer" by applying a reasonable person standard. Maness v. Vill. of Pinehurst, - N.C. App. - , 838 S.E.2d 467 (2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appeal Held Timely Despite Late Filing. - Claimant's appeal from ruling of Employment Security Commission denying unemployment compensation was timely where, although the 30-day period ended July 7 and claimant's appeal was not filed until July 8, 1986,
                        claimant received his copy of the petition, which was mailed on July 3, on July 5, 1986, and counsel for the employer received his copy on July 7, 1986; the failure of the petition to be marked "filed" in the clerk's office was
                        through no fault of petitioner and any neglect was excusable. Edwards v. Milliken &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 379 S.E.2d 82 (1989).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Superior court had authority to allow a late appeal from the adjudicator's determination; since the Commission's regulations allow it to grant extensions of time and to permit acts to be done after the expiration of the time allowed, the Commission's
                        rulings were fully reviewable on appeal. Riddick v. Atlantic Veneer, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 379 S.E.2d 661 (1989).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The statement of the grounds of the appeal formerly required by subsection (i) had to be filed within the time allowed for appeal. Its purpose was to give notice to the Commission and adverse parties of the alleged errors committed by the Commission and
                        limit the scope of the hearing in the superior court to the specific questions of law raised by the errors assigned it. It was intended, and had to be construed, as a condition precedent to the right of appeal. Noncompliance therewith
                        was fatal. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 651</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 311 (1951).

                        of the superior court on appeal being limited to questions of law. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell,

                        the stoppage, was supported by ample evidence and was therefore conclusive, there being no allegation or evidence of fraud. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 277</cite>,

                        As the findings of fact made by the Commission, when supported by competent evidence, are conclusive and binding on the reviewing courts, which are to hear the appeal on questions of law only, the dismissal of the appeal in the court below for failure
                        to file a statement of grounds as formerly required by subsection (i) deprived the claimants of no substantial right to which, otherwise, they might have been entitled. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n,

                        The reviewing court under subsection (i) of this section may determine upon proper exceptions whether the facts found by the Commission were supported by competent evidence and whether the findings so supported sustain the legal conclusions and the award
                        made, but in no event may the reviewing court consider the evidence for the purpose of finding the facts for itself. In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).

                        Findings of fact by the Commission which are supported by competent evidence in the record are conclusive on appeal. Yelverton v. Kemp Furn. Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 275 S.E.2d 553 (1981); Vanhorn

                        Even when findings are not supported by the evidence, where there is no exception taken to such findings they are presumed to be supported by the evidence and are binding on appeal.

                        Based on an employee's own testimony and documentary evidence that his failure to comply with the reasonable requirements of his job, specifically load and unload materials as directed and keep proper records, and because these requirements were reasonable
                        and within his own control, the Employment Security Commission did not err by concluding that the employee was discharged for substantial fault and the trial court did not err by upholding this Commission's ruling. Reeves v. Yellow
                        Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 613 S.E.2d 350, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 853</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 511 (2005).

                        Superior and appellate courts, under G.S. 96-15(i), were bound by the North Carolina Employment Security Commission's findings of fact because there was sufficient evidence to establish that the former employee missed work for medical reasons. James v.
                        Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Superior court did not violate G.S. 96-15(i) by correcting an appeals referee's finding of fact because the finding of fact contained a mere misstatement by the referee of no consequence to the ultimate determination that an employee's discharge from
                        employment with the employer was not due to substantial fault or misconduct in connection with the work. James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence of the former employee's stress related medical problems was sufficient to permit the North Carolina Employment Security Commission to determine that the employee's absences were for good cause and that she did give her employer appropriate notice
                        regarding her absences; thereby defeating the employer's argument that the employee's absenteeism constituted misconduct under G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed). James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Employment Security Commission properly found that work-related misconduct was the basis of an employee's termination and properly denied unemployment benefits because the employee removed the hard drive from the employee's work computer and asserted
                        a personal copyright interest in the employer's catalogs and web site without seeking and receiving permission, evidencing a deliberate disregard of standards of behavior which the employer had the right to expect of an employee.

                        Division of Employment Security properly determined, for purposes of an employee's claim for unemployment insurance benefits, that when the employer changed its vehicle policy for its employees, the employee had a personal vehicle that he could use to
                        commute to work; the findings were supported by the evidence. King v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 743 S.E.2d 83 (2013).

                        Trial court erred as a matter of law in making conclusions of law which were not supported by the findings of fact adopted from the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security and thus, the trial court should have affirmed the
                        decision of Department, denying unemployment benefits. Bailey v. Div. of Empl. Sec., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 10, 753 S.E.2d 219 (2014).

        Conclusion of Law.
       </b> - The conclusions of law of the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security, are reviewed de novo. A determination that an employee's unemployment is due to misconduct connected with the work
                        is a conclusion of law, and is therefore reviewed de novo. Burroughs v. Green Apple, LLC, - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 267 (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deliberate Violation of Attendance Rules. - Most courts have held that persistent or chronic absences, at least where absences are without excuse or notice, and the employee has been given warnings by the employer, constitute misconduct within the meaning
                        of the unemployment compensation laws. Obviously, when an employee is absent due to illness but fails to give proper notice the absence can amount to misconduct, not because of the illness per se but because the employee has an
                        obligation to the employer to mitigate any damages an illness may cause the enterprise by giving appropriate notice. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Where prior to the claimant's going on leave, she was on probation due to absence from work and tardiness in reporting to work; the employer had a known, reasonable policy that provided that medical leaves of absence can be granted or extended only upon
                        the request of the employee's physician and the claimant was aware of this policy; and when the claimant reported back to work at the usual time she did not present a doctor's excuse for the previous day's absence, or to extend
                        the leave of absence, the Commission could reasonably conclude that the claimant deliberately violated her employer's attendance rules. Therefore, the Commission's findings supported its conclusion that she had been discharged
                        for "misconduct connected with her work." Davis v. Corning Glass Works, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 309 S.E.2d 258 (1983).

                        Good Faith Effort to Comply with Notification of Absence Rule. - Where claimant was absent four consecutive days after a twenty-month infraction-free period of employment, and a combination of unfortunate circumstances prevented claimant from meeting
                        the strict requirements of his employer's rule regarding notification of absence, but the evidence from the record was clear that claimant made a good faith effort to comply with the rule, the facts and circumstances did not support
                        the Employment Security Commission's finding of misconduct. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d 43 (1985).

                        Remand by Deputy Commissioner. - Where the findings of the referee and the record together were insufficient to resolve certain issues in either party's favor, the deputy commissioner did not abuse his discretion in remanding for a new hearing. Williams

                        Remand Where Findings of Fact Supported But Insufficient. - If the findings of fact made by the Commission, even though supported by competent evidence in the record, are insufficient to enable the court to determine the rights of the parties upon the
                        matters in controversy, the proceeding should be remanded to the end that the Commission make proper findings. In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).

                        a determination is requested.

                    G.S. 105-236(9a) applies to a "contribution tax return preparer" to the same extent as it applies to an income tax preparer. As used in this subsection, a "contribution tax return preparer" is a person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one
                    or more persons to prepare for compensation, any return of tax imposed by this Chapter or any claim for refund of tax imposed by this Chapter. For purposes of this definition, the completion of a substantial portion of a return or
                    claim for refund is treated as the preparation of the return or claim for refund. The term does not include a person merely because the person (i) furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance, (ii) prepares a return
                    or claim for refund of the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed, (iii) prepares as a fiduciary a return or claim for refund for any person, or (iv) represents

                    The penalty in G.S. 105-236(7) applies with respect to unemployment insurance contributions under this Chapter only when one of the following circumstances exist in connection with the violation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    If none of the circumstances set forth in subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection exist in connection with a violation of G.S. 105-236(7) applied under this Chapter, the offender is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and each day the violation continues
                    constitutes a separate offense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Division finds that any person violated G.S. 105-236(9a) and is not subject to a fraud penalty, the person shall pay a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation for each day the violations continue, plus the reasonable costs
                    of investigation and enforcement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The penalty amount may be collected in any manner allowed for the recovery of the erroneous payment, except that the penalty amount may not be recovered through offsets of future benefits. When a recovery with respect to an erroneous payment is made,
                    any recovery applies first to the principal of the erroneous payment, then to the federally mandated penalty amount imposed under this subsection, and finally to any other amounts due.

                    The General Assembly finds it in the best interests of this State that the establishment, maintenance, and funding of State job training, education, and placement programs be based on current, comprehensive information on the effectiveness of these programs
                    in securing employment for North Carolina citizens and providing a well-trained workforce for business and industry in this State. To this end, it is the purpose of this Article to require the establishment of an information system
                    that maintains up-to-date job-related information on current and former participants in State job training and education programs.
