                        Section 1 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-1] was a statement of the purposes of the Act. Although extensively cited by courts, it was eliminated because Uniform Acts no longer contain such a section. Nonetheless, this Act should be interpreted according
                        to its purposes which are to:

                        Legislative Intent. - The former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act was intended to prevent forum shopping for the convenience of competing parents to the detriment of the real interest of the child. Holland v. Holland,

                        Purpose. - The former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act sought to prevent parents from forum shopping their child custody disputes and to assure that these disputes were litigated in the state with which the child and the child's family had the closest
                        connection. In re Van Kooten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 764, 487 S.E.2d 160 (1997), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 576</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 618 (1998).

                        Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.S. 50A-101 et seq., provides a uniform set of jurisdictional rules and guidelines for the national enforcement of child custody orders. In re Q.V., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        737, 596 S.E.2d 867 (2004).

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to enter a custody order because the action was commenced in North Carolina; even though the father, mother, and child moved out of the State shortly after the initiation of the suit, North Carolina retained its jurisdiction
                        under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) until the conclusion of the matter, and that continuity promoted the UCCJEA's purpose of avoiding jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of
                        other States. Waly v. Alkamary, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 17, 2021).

                        What Law Governs. - The issue of a state court's jurisdiction over child custody matters is governed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (see now G.S. 50A-101 et seq.) and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C.

                        the action is governed by this Chapter (see now Article 2 of this Chapter), just as it is in any other custody dispute. Danna v. Danna, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 364 S.E.2d 694, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 479</cite>,

                        The question of subject matter jurisdiction could be raised at any point in a proceeding under the former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, and such jurisdiction could not be conferred by waiver, estoppel or consent. Sloop v. Friberg,
                        <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d 921 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The district courts of this State possess general subject matter jurisdiction over child custody disputes. Such matters are in no wise reserved by the Constitution or laws of North Carolina to the exclusive consideration of another tribunal. Therefore,
                        the real question under the former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act was whether jurisdiction was properly exercised according to the statutory requirements in a particular case. Sloop v. Friberg,
                        <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 320 S.E.2d 921 (1984).

                        Trial Court Lacked Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Although the general requirement for jurisdiction was satisfied as the children who were the subject of a petition to terminate their mother's parental rights resided in North Carolina when the petition
                        was filed, the trial court's order denying the mother's motion to dismiss was vacated as the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the North Carolina Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, NC. Gen.

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly dismissed a grandfather's complaint for custody of his maternal grandchild because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to proceed due to a pre-existing child custody action between the child's paternal grandparents and the child's
                        now-deceased mother, which did not abate for reasons of constitutional and statutory law and, and, while any relative could seek custody of a child, the grandfather did not file suit against an allegedly unfit parent, and as his
                        complaint was more akin to a request to modify the custody order than it was an initial claim for custody, the proper procedure for the grandfather was to file a motion to intervene and a motion for custody in the grandparents'
                        custody action. Rivera v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 824 S.E.2d 164 (2019).

                        Full Faith and Credit Properly Refused. - Refusal of North Carolina court to give full faith and credit to a Michigan custody award was not improper, where Michigan's exercise of jurisdiction was not consistent with the Parental Kidnapping Act, 28 U.S.C.

                        Power to Award Custody to Foster Parents. - Having acquired subject matter jurisdiction, trial court, guided by the best interests of the child, had broad dispositional powers, including the power to award legal custody of child to its foster parents.

                        No Attorney Fees After Contempt Motion. - Father's request for attorney fees was properly denied as a mother had filed a motion for contempt; she did not seek the expedited enforcement of a child custody determination, seek to register an out-of-state
                        order, or otherwise utilize the remedies set forth in Part 3 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), and thus Part 3 of the UCCJEA was not implicated and G.S. 50A-312 did not apply. Creighton v.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The UCCJA did not contain a definition of "child." The definition here is taken from the PKPA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "child-custody determination" now closely tracks the PKPA definition. It encompasses any judgment, decree or other order which provides for the custody of, or visitation with, a child, regardless of local terminology, including such
                        labels as "managing conservatorship" or "parenting plan."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "child-custody proceeding" has been expanded from the comparable definition in the UCCJA. These listed proceedings have generally been determined to be the type of proceeding to which the UCCJA and PKPA are applicable. The list of examples
                        removes any controversy about the types of proceedings where a custody determination can occur. Proceedings that affect access to the child are subject to this Act. The inclusion of proceedings related to protection from domestic
                        violence is necessary because in some States domestic violence proceedings may affect custody of and visitation with a child. Juvenile delinquency or proceedings to confer contractual rights are not "custody proceedings" because
                        they do not relate to civil aspects of access to a child. While a determination of paternity is covered under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the custody and visitation aspects of paternity cases are custody proceedings.
                        Cases involving the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction have not been included at this point because custody of the child is not determined in a proceeding under the International Child Abductions
                        Remedies Act. Those proceedings are specially included in the Article 3 enforcement process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Commencement" has been included in the definitions as a replacement for the term "pending" found in the UCCJA. Its inclusion simplifies some of the simultaneous proceedings provisions of this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "home State" has been reworded slightly. No substantive change is intended from the UCCJA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "issuing State" is borrowed from UIFSA. In UIFSA, it refers to the court that issued the support or parentage order. Here, it refers to the State, or the court, which made the custody determination that is sought to be enforced. It is used primarily
                        in Article 3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "person" has been added to ensure that the provisions of this Act apply when the State is the moving party in a custody proceeding or has legal custody of a child. The definition of "person" is the one that is mandated for all Uniform Acts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "person acting as a parent" has been slightly redefined. It has been broadened from the definition in the UCCJA to include a person who has acted as a parent for a significant period of time prior to the filing of the custody proceeding as well
                        as a person who currently has physical custody of the child. In addition, a person acting as a parent must either have legal custody or claim a right to legal custody under the law of this State. The reference to the law of this
                        State means that a court determines the issue of whether someone is a "person acting as a parent" under its own law. This reaffirms the traditional view that a court in a child custody case applies its own substantive law. The
                        court does not have to undertake a choice-of-law analysis to determine whether the individual who is claiming to be a person acting as a parent has standing to seek custody of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "tribe" is the one mandated for use in Uniform Acts. Should a State choose to apply this Act to tribal adjudications, this definition should be enacted as well as the entirety of Section 104.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "contestant" as has been omitted from this revision. It was defined in the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2(1) [former G.S. 50A-2(1)] as "a person, including a parent, who claims a right to custody or visitation rights with respect to a child." It seems to have served little purpose over the years, and whatever function
                        it once had has been subsumed by state laws on who has standing to seek custody of or visitation with a child. In addition UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2(5) [former G.S. 50A-2(4)] of the which defined "decree" and "custody decree" has been eliminated as duplicative of the definition of "custody determination."

                        The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the custody of a child, where the father's former companion sought custody of the child as the child had lived with the companion in North Carolina until a month before her complaint was filed. Ellison
                        v. Ramos, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 502 S.E.2d 891 (1998), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 356</cite>, 517 S.E.2d 891 (1998).

                        In the child custody dispute where the mother lived in Maryland and the father lived in North Carolina, the North Carolina trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to G.S. 50A-201, because the children had lived in North Carolina for six months prior to
                        the custody action being filed, and as a result, it was their home state under G.S. 50A-102(7). David v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 571 S.E.2d 230 (2002).

                        Trial court properly found that it had jurisdiction to enter custody and termination orders under circumstances in which, at the time of the petition, the older child was in the custody of the department in North Carolina and had been for 18 months, the
                        mother had earlier moved to North Carolina with the older child, at the date of the petition the mother was incarcerated in North Carolina, and the younger child had no contact with any other state; because the trial court asserted
                        its jurisdiction in the order and the evidence supported its determination, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction. In re T.J.D.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 642 S.E.2d 471
                        (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 568</cite>, 651 S.E.2d 562 (2007).

                        North Carolina was the child's home state pursuant to the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act because the child resided with the mother for a period of more than six months immediately preceding
                        the commencement of the custody proceeding. Williams v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 648 S.E.2d 536 (2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        North Carolina had jurisdiction over a custody case involving a child who had resided in North Carolina with his paternal grandparents for at least six months prior to the filing of the custody action, even though the trial court's findings did not expressly
                        track the language in G.S. 50A-102(7). Because a Florida order on child support did not provide for legal custody, physical custody, or visitation, it was not a child custody determination, allowing North Carolina to properly exercise
                        jurisdiction. Powers v. Wagner, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 716 S.E.2d 354 (2011).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neither before nor after the trial court's entry of the nonsecure custody orders had there been any custody proceedings instituted or custody orders entered in any state other than North Carolina, and the child had lived in the State with the child's
                        foster parents since September 2011, and thus North Carolina became the child's home state such that the trial court possessed jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights. In re N.T.U.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina court had child custody jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-201(a)(2) because (1) no state was the child's home state and (2) the child, the child's parents, and the child's grandparents, who were acting as parents, lived in North Carolina, and
                        substantial evidence about the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships was available in North Carolina. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93

                        Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and
                        disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the children, the trial court could assert
                        jurisdiction. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                        Orders granting the county department of social services (DSS) custody of a child were not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and DSS had standing to file the petition to terminate the mother's parental rights, because the trial court had "home
                        state" jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination regarding the child; the child had lived with the mother in North Carolina during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the juvenile petition. In re

                        Father failed to show that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify a Delaware court custody order under the UCCJEA where it was undisputed that the child's mother, the father, and the child no longer resided in Delaware when the county
                        department of social services (DSS) filed the juvenile petition, and initial information that the child did not reside in North Carolina was superseded by more accurate information that the child had resided in the state for more
                        than six months before DSS filed the juvenile petition. Thus, North Carolina was the child's home state. In re L.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 567</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 199 (2020).

                        Trial court did not err in dismissing the father's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction after finding that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the older child because North Carolina was not her home state. Halili v. Ramnishta,

                        Trial court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over the termination of a parental rights case regarding a child because it properly determined that North Carolina was the home state for the child; the child was born in North Carolina and lived with
                        foster parents in the State for the six months immediately before the filing of the termination of parental rights petition, and for the entirety of her life, the child lived in North Carolina. In re N.P.,

                        Texas custody order was an "initial determination" because the order stated the child's father was to have no contact with the child, the child's mother had temporary sole custody, and the father had not established paternity and was not entitled to possession
                        of or access to the child. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction, under G.S. 50A-203, to modify a Texas custody order because, while the court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order, (1) the Texas court did not find that court no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction
                        or that a North Carolina court was a more convenient forum, and (2) the trial court found the child's mother resided in Texas. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        Changed Circumstances. - Where the parties crossed out a cohabitation provision on the face of their separation memorandum, the trial court only partially discharged its duty when it found that a change of circumstances occurred when husband began cohabiting
                        with his girlfriend but failed to determine whether plaintiff had met her burden of showing the effect, if any, such change had upon the welfare of the children. Browning v. Helff, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                        420, 524 S.E.2d 95 (2000).

                        order, or otherwise utilize the remedies set forth in Part 3 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), and thus Part 3 of the UCCJEA was not implicated and G.S. 50A-312 did not apply. Creighton v.

                        to the commencement of the mother's custody proceeding in North Carolina. Vermont qualified as the children's home state under North Carolina and Vermont law despite a six week absence from Vermont to North Carolina, which was
                        deemed a temporary absence insufficient to prevent the conclusion that Vermont was the home state. Chick v. Chick, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 596 S.E.2d 303 (2004).

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Two proceedings are governed by other acts. Adoption cases are excluded from this Act because adoption is a specialized area which is thoroughly covered by the Uniform Adoption Act (UAA) (1994). Most States either will adopt that Act or will adopt the
                        jurisdictional provisions of that Act. Therefore the jurisdictional provisions governing adoption proceeding are generally found elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there are likely to be a number of instances where it will be necessary to apply this Act in an adoption proceeding. For example, if a State adopts the UAA then Section 3-101 of the Act specifically refers in places to the Uniform Child Custody
                        Jurisdiction Act which will become a reference to this Act. Second, the UAA requires that if an adoption is denied or set aside, the court is to determine the child's custody. UAA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 3-704. Those custody proceedings would be subject to this Act. See Joan Heifetz Hollinger, The Uniform Adoption Act: Reporter's Ruminations, 30 Fam.L.Q. 345 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Children that are the subject of interstate placements for adoption or foster care are governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). The UAA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2-107 provides that the provisions of the compact, although not jurisdictional, supply the governing rules for all children who are subject to it. As stated in the Comments to that section: "Once a court exercises
                        jurisdiction, the ICPC helps determine the legality of an interstate placement." For a discussion of the relationship between the UCCJA and the ICPC see J.D.S. v. Franks, 893 P.2d 732 (Ariz. 1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proceedings pertaining to the authorization of emergency medical care for children are outside the scope of this Act since they are not custody determinations. All States have procedures which allow the State to temporarily supersede parental authority
                        for purposes of emergency medical procedures. Those provisions will govern without regard to this Act.

                        This section allows States the discretion to extend the terms of this Act to Indian tribes by removing the brackets. The definition of "tribe" is found at Section 102(16). This Act does not purport to legislate custody jurisdiction for tribal courts.
                        However, a Tribe could adopt this Act as enabling legislation by simply replacing references to "this State" with "this Tribe."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) is not bracketed. If the Indian Child Welfare Act requires that a case be heard in tribal court, then its provisions determine jurisdiction.

                        The provisions of this Act have international application to child custody proceedings and determinations of other countries. Another country will be treated as if it were a State of the United States for purposes of applying Articles 1 and 2 of this
                        Act. Custody determinations of other countries will be enforced if the facts of the case indicate that jurisdiction was in substantial compliance with the requirements of this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this section, the term "child-custody determination" should be interpreted to include proceedings relating to custody or analogous institutions of the other country. See generally, Article 3 of The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law,
                        Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A court of this State may refuse to apply this Act when the child custody law of the other country violates basic principles relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The same concept is found in of the Section 20 of the Hague
                        Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (return of the child may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights
                        and fundamental freedoms). In applying subsection (c), the court's scrutiny should be on the child custody law of the foreign country and not on other aspects of the other legal system. This Act takes no position on what laws relating
                        to child custody would violate fundamental freedoms. While the provision is a traditional one in international agreements, it is invoked only in the most egregious cases.

                        This section authorizes notice and proof of service to be made by any method allowed by either the State which issues the notice or the State where the notice is received. This eliminates the need to specify the type of notice in the Act and therefore
                        the provisions of Section 5 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-5] which specified how notice was to be accomplished were eliminated. The change reflects an approach in this Act to use local law to determine many procedural issues. Thus,
                        service by facsimile is permissible if allowed by local rule in either State. In addition, where special service or notice rules are available for some procedures, in either jurisdiction, they could be utilized under this Act.
                        For example, if a case involves domestic violence and the statute of either State would authorize notice to be served by a peace officer, such service could be used under this Act.

                        Although Section 105 requires foreign countries to be treated as States for purposes of this Act, attorneys should be cautioned about service and notice in foreign countries. Countries have their own rules on service which must usually be followed. Attorneys
                        should consult the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, 20 U.S.T. 36, T.I.A.S. 6638 (1965).

                        This section establishes a general principle that participation in a custody proceeding does not, by itself, give the court jurisdiction over any issue for which personal jurisdiction over the individual is required. The term "participate" should be read
                        broadly. For example, if jurisdiction is proper under Article 2, a respondent in an original custody determination, or a party in a modification determination, should be able to request custody without this constituting the seeking
                        of affirmative relief that would waive personal jurisdictional objections. Once jurisdiction is proper under Article 2, a party should not be placed in the dilemma of choosing between seeking custody or protecting a right not to
                        be subject to a monetary judgment by a court with no other relationship to the party.

                        This section is comparable to the immunity provision of UIFSA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 314. A party who is otherwise not subject to personal jurisdiction can appear in a custody proceeding or an enforcement action without being subject to the general jurisdiction of the State by virtue of the appearance.
                        However, if the petitioner would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the State, appearing in a custody proceeding or filing an enforcement proceeding will not provide immunity. Thus, if the non-custodial parent moves from
                        the State that decided the custody determination, that parent is still subject to the state's jurisdiction for enforcement of child support if the child or an individual obligee continues to reside there. See UIFSA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 205. If the non-custodial parent returns to enforce the visitation aspects of the custody determination, the State can utilize any appropriate means to collect the back-due child support. However, the situation is
                        different if both parties move from State A after the determination, with the custodial parent and the child establishing a new home State in State B, and the non-custodial parent moving to State C. The non-custodial parent is
                        not, at this point, subject to the jurisdiction of State B for monetary matters. See
                        <i>
        Kulko v. Superior Court
       </i> , 436 U.S. 84 (1978). If the non-custodial parent comes into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the determination, the non-custodial parent is not subject to the jurisdiction of State B for those proceedings
                        and issues requiring personal jurisdiction by filing the enforcement action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A party also is immune from service of process during the time in the State for an enforcement action except for those claims for which jurisdiction could be based on contacts other than mere physical presence. Thus, when the non-custodial parent comes
                        into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the decree, State B cannot acquire jurisdiction over the child support aspects of the decree by serving the non-custodial parent in the State. Cf. UIFSA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 611 (personally serving the obligor in the State of the residence of the obligee is not by itself a sufficient jurisdictional basis to authorize a modification of child support). However, a party who is in this State
                        and subject to the jurisdiction of another State may be served with process to appear in that State, if allowable under the laws of that State.

                        As the Comments to UIFSA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 314 note, the immunity provided by this section is limited. It does not provide immunity for civil litigation unrelated to the enforcement action. For example, a party to an enforcement action is not immune from
                        service regarding a claim that involves an automobile accident occurring while the party is in the State.

                    <p>
                        This section emphasizes the role of judicial communications. It authorizes a court to communicate concerning any proceeding arising under this Act. This includes communication with foreign tribunals and tribal courts. Communication can occur in many different
                        ways such as by telephonic conference and by on-line or other electronic communication. The Act does not preclude any method of communication and recognizes that there will be increasing use of modern communication techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Communication between courts is required under Sections 204, 206, and 306 and strongly suggested in applying Section 207. Apart from those sections, there may be less need under this Act for courts to communicate concerning jurisdiction due to the prioritization
                        of home state jurisdiction. Communication is authorized, however, whenever the court finds it would be helpful. The court may authorize the parties to participate in the communication. However, the Act does not mandate participation.
                        Communication between courts is often difficult to schedule and participation by the parties may be impractical. Phone calls often have to be made after-hours or whenever the schedules of judges allow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section does require that a record be made of the conversation and that the parties have access to that record in order to be informed of the content of the conversation. The only exception to this requirement is when the communication involves relatively
                        inconsequential matters such as scheduling, calendars, and court records. Included within this latter type of communication would be matters of cooperation between courts under Section 112. A record includes notes or transcripts
                        of a court reporter who listened to a conference call between the courts, an electronic recording of a telephone call, a memorandum or an electronic record of the communication between the courts, or a memorandum or an electronic
                        record made by a court after the communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second sentence of subsection (b) protects the parties against unauthorized ex parte communications. The parties' participation in the communication may amount to a hearing if there is an opportunity to present facts and jurisdictional arguments.
                        However, absent such an opportunity, the participation of the parties should not to be considered a substitute for a hearing and the parties must be given an opportunity to fairly and fully present facts and arguments on the jurisdictional
                        issue before a determination is made. This may be done through a hearing or, if appropriate, by affidavit or memorandum. The court is expected to set forth the basis for its jurisdictional decision, including any court-to-court
                        communication which may have been a factor in the decision.

                    <p>
                        Sufficient record of communication found. - Vermont family court order asserting jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding filed by a father and directing custody of the parties' two minor children to him that stated that it consulted with the appropriate
                        judge presiding in the custody proceedings commenced in North Carolina by the mother and that indicated that the conversation between the two courts disclosed that the facts alleged by the parties in their respective cases were
                        substantially similar, was a sufficient record of the communication between the two courts. Mother did not dispute the procedural history as set out in the Vermont order concerning the North Carolina proceeding and she failed to
                        show that she was deprived of an opportunity to fairly and fully present facts and arguments on the jurisdictional issue before the North Carolina court. Chick v. Chick, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        444, 596 S.E.2d 303 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Communicate. - Trial court's adjudication and disposition, custody review, and permanency planning orders were vacated because (1) another state had entered a custody order as to the child, and (2) the trial court did not exercise temporary
                        emergency jurisdiction in entering these orders, as none of the orders stated an adequate time within which to obtain an order from the court that entered the initial custody order, the court did not immediately communicate with
                        that court, and the court did not purport to exercise emergency jurisdiction, as the court merely found the court had jurisdiction. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d
                        228 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Temporary Emergency Jurisdiction. - - Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing
                        on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the
                        children, the trial court could assert jurisdiction. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                        The provision on the assessment of costs for travel provided in the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 19 [former G.S. 50A-19] has been changed. The UCCJA provided that the costs may be assessed against the parties or the State or county. Assessment of costs against a government entity in a case where the government
                        is not involved is inappropriate and therefore that provision has been removed. In addition, if the State is involved as a party, assessment of costs and expenses against the State must be authorized by other law. It should be
                        noted that the term "expenses" means out-of-pocket costs. Overhead costs should not be assessed as expenses.

                    <p>
                        No other substantive changes have been made. The term "social study" as used in the UCCJA was replaced with the modern term: "custody evaluation." The Act does not take a position on the admissibility of a custody evaluation that was conducted in another
                        State. It merely authorizes a court to seek assistance of, or render assistance to, a court of another State.

                    <p>
                        This section provides mandatory jurisdictional rules for the original child custody proceeding. It generally continues the provisions of the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 3 [former G.S. 50A-3.] However, there have been a number of changes to the jurisdictional bases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
        1. Home State Jurisdiction.
       </b> The jurisdiction of the home State has been prioritized over other jurisdictional bases. Section 3 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-3] provided four independent and concurrent bases of jurisdiction. The PKPA provides that
                        full faith and credit can only be given to an initial custody determination of a "significant connection" State when there is no home State. This Act prioritizes home state jurisdiction in the same manner as the PKPA thereby eliminating
                        any potential conflict between the two acts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The six-month extended home state provision of subsection (a)(1) has been modified slightly from the UCCJA. The UCCJA provided that home state jurisdiction continued for six months when the child had been removed by a person seeking the child's custody
                        or for other reasons and a parent or a person acting as a parent continues to reside in the home State. Under this Act, it is no longer necessary to determine why the child has been removed. The only inquiry relates to the status
                        of the person left behind. This change provides a slightly more refined home state standard than the UCCJA or the PKPA, which also requires a determination that the child has been removed "by a contestant or for other reasons."
                        The scope of the PKPA's provision is theoretically narrower than this Act. However, the phrase "or for other reasons" covers most fact situations where the child is not in the home State and, therefore, the difference has no substantive
                        effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In another sense, the six-month extended home state jurisdiction provision is this Act is narrower than the comparable provision in the PKPA. The PKPA's definition of extended home State is more expansive because it applies whenever a "contestant" remains
                        in the home State. That class of individuals has been eliminated in this Act. This Act retains the original UCCJA classification of "parent or person acting as parent" to define who must remain for a State to exercise the six-month
                        extended home state jurisdiction. This eliminates the undesirable jurisdictional determinations which would occur as a result of differing state substantive laws on visitation involving grandparents and others. For example, if
                        State A's law provided that grandparents could obtain visitation with a child after the death of one of the parents, then the grandparents, who would be considered "contestants" under the PKPA, could file a proceeding within six
                        months after the remaining parent moved and have the case heard in State A. However, if State A did not provide that grandparents could seek visitation under such circumstances, the grandparents would not be considered "contestants"
                        and State B where the child acquired a new home State would provide the only forum. This Act bases jurisdiction on the parent and child or person acting as a parent and child relationship without regard to grandparents or other
                        potential seekers of custody or visitation. There is no conflict with the broader provision of the PKPA. The PKPA in
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> (c)(1) authorizes States to narrow the scope of their jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
        2. Significant connection jurisdiction.
       </b> This jurisdictional basis has been amended in four particulars from the UCCJA. First, the "best interest" language of the UCCJA has been eliminated. This phrase tended to create confusion between the jurisdictional
                        issue and the substantive custody determination. Since the language was not necessary for the jurisdictional issue, it has been removed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, the UCCJA based jurisdiction on the presence of a significant connection between the child and the child's parents or the child and at least one contestant. This Act requires that the significant connections be between the child, the child's parents
                        or the child and a person acting as a parent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, a significant connection State may assume jurisdiction only when there is no home State or when the home State decides that the significant connection State would be a more appropriate forum under Section 207 or 208. Fourth, the determination of
                        significant connections has been changed to eliminate the language of "present or future care." The jurisdictional determination should be made by determining whether there is sufficient evidence in the State for the court to make
                        an informed custody determination. That evidence might relate to the past as well as to the "present or future."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emergency jurisdiction has been moved to a separate section. This is to make it clear that the power to protect a child in crisis does not include the power to enter a permanent order for that child except as provided by that section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paragraph (a)(3) provides for jurisdiction when all States with jurisdiction under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) determine that this State is a more appropriate forum. The determination would have to be made by all States with jurisdiction under subsection
                        (a)(1) and (2). Jurisdiction would not exist under this paragraph because the home State determined it is a more appropriate place to hear the case if there is another State that could exercise significant connection jurisdiction
                        under subsection (a)(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paragraph (a)(4) retains the concept of jurisdiction by necessity as found in the UCCJA and in the PKPA. This default jurisdiction only occurs if no other State would have jurisdiction under subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsections (b) and (c) clearly State the relationship between jurisdiction under this Act and other forms of jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction over, or the physical presence of, a parent or the child is neither necessary nor required under this Act.
                        In other words neither minimum contacts nor service within the State is required for the court to have jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Further, the presence of minimum contacts or service within the State does not
                        confer jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Subject to Section 204, satisfaction of the requirements of subsection (a) is mandatory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirements of this section, plus the notice and hearing provisions of the Act, are all that is necessary to satisfy due process. This Act, like the UCCJA and the PKPA is based on Justice Frankfurter's concurrence in
                        <i>
        May v. Anderson
       </i> , 345 U.S. 528 (1953). As pointed out by Professor Bodenheimer, the reporter for the UCCJA, no "workable interstate custody law could be built around [Justice] Burton's plurality opinion . . . . Bridgette Bodenheimer,

                        is subject matter jurisdiction, an agreement of the parties to confer jurisdiction on a court that would not otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act is ineffective.

                    <p>
                        Applicability. - G.S. 50A-201 was inapplicable to a petition to terminate a mother's parental rights as an Arkansas court had addressed custody issues as to the children and had awarded custody to the father. In re N.R.M.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 598 S.E.2d 147 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Because the statute pertained only to initial custody determinations, and the initial custody order in the case was made by a Virginia court, the statute was inapplicable. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        52, 767 S.E.2d 905 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - The former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act sought to prevent parents from forum shopping their child custody disputes and to assure that these disputes were litigated in the state with which the child and the child's family had the closest
                        connection. In re Van Kooten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 764, 487 S.E.2d 160 (1997), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 576</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 618 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Courts which render a custody decree normally retain continuing jurisdiction to modify the decree under local law. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 281 S.E.2d 411 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Once jurisdiction of the court attaches to a child custody matter, it exists for all time until the cause is fully and completely determined. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied,

                        Jurisdiction over Petition Brought by DSS. - The district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of petition filed, signed and verified by county division of social services, which alleged that child had been placed with DSS by its mother; that
                        the putative father was unknown; that North Carolina was the home state of the child and no other state had jurisdiction over the child; and that the best interest of the child would be served if the court assumed jurisdiction
                        over him. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 345 S.E.2d 404, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 415</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 589 (1986).

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to enter an initial child custody order because (1) North Carolina was the child's home state within six months of the initiation of the proceeding, and (2) the child's father resided in North Carolina at all relevant times.

                        Orders granting the county department of social services (DSS) custody of a child were not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and DSS had standing to file the petition to terminate the mother's parental rights, because the trial court had "home
                        state" jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination regarding the child; the child had lived with the mother in North Carolina during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the juvenile petition. In re

                        Although the child resided in North Carolina, the court properly declined jurisdiction because the father continued to reside in the state of the court of original jurisdiction; thus, the Florida court retained jurisdiction under the Parental Kidnapping

                        Trial Court Erred in Exercising Jurisdiction. - The trial court in this State erred in exercising its jurisdiction over a custody matter where a proceeding was already pending in an Indiana court and the child had lived in Indiana since 1981, a period
                        of six years. Indiana was exercising jurisdiction in substantial conformity with the former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), and North Carolina was required to decline jurisdiction over the custody issue. Lynch v.

                        Where an Indiana order, which awarded custody of child living in Indiana to mother, contained no findings of fact that Indiana was child's home state, or had been her home state within six months before the action was commenced, or that it was in her
                        best interests for Indiana to assume jurisdiction because she had significant connection with the state, a North Carolina trial court erred in concluding that North Carolina must give full faith and credit to the Indiana orders;
                        the Indiana court had not assumed jurisdiction over the custody determination of the child in substantial conformity with this Act. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 406, 430

                        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order adjudicating a mother's son neglected and dependent and placing him in the custody of a department because there was no finding of fact, order, or other indication that the New York court involved in prior
                        protective services had opted not to exercise jurisdiction; there was no finding or conclusion concerning status of the New York court's jurisdiction or finding that the North Carolina court met the requirements of G.S. 50A-201(a)(1)
                        or G.S. 50A-201(a)(2) such that it could make a modification under G.S. 50A-203. In re E.J., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 333, 738 S.E.2d 204 (2013).

                        Neither before nor after the trial court's entry of the nonsecure custody orders had there been any custody proceedings instituted or custody orders entered in any state other than North Carolina, and the child had lived in the State with the child's
                        foster parents since September 2011, and thus North Carolina became the child's home state such that the trial court possessed jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights. In re N.T.U.,

                        It was error for a North Carolina trial court to exercise custody modification jurisdiction because, inter alia, the subject children had no "home state," as (1) neither the children nor the children's parents lived in North Carolina at the commencement
                        of the proceedings, nor had the children lived in North Carolina within six months of commencement, (2) the children's absence from Utah was not temporary, and (3) the children had not lived in Germany or Florida for six consecutive
                        months before commencement. Gerhauser v. Van Bourgondien, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 767 S.E.2d 378 (2014).

                        court could exercise jurisdiction if it determined (1) that the court of the other state no longer had jurisdiction and North Carolina had jurisdiction under one of the four alternatives listed in former G.S. 50A-3, or (2) the
                        court of the other state did not exercise jurisdiction in substantial conformity with the former UCCJA and North Carolina had jurisdiction pursuant to former G.S. 50A-3.

                        track the language in G.S. 50A-102(7). Because a Florida order on child support did not provide for legal custody, physical custody, or visitation, it was not a child custody determination, allowing North Carolina to properly exercise
                        jurisdiction. Powers v. Wagner, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 716 S.E.2d 354 (2011).

                        North Carolina court had jurisdiction to modify an Illinois custody order because (1) the North Carolina court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order due to an Illinois judge's transfer of the case to North Carolina since the mother had not
                        lived in Illinois for a number of years and the child's alleged abuse occurred in North Carolina, tantamount to finding North Carolina was the more appropriate forum, (2) the record showed the mother and child had a significant
                        connection with North Carolina other than mere physical presence, and (3) substantial evidence was available in North Carolina as the child's alleged sexual assault and other acts of neglect by the mother occurred in North Carolina,

                        for modification jurisdiction were met, and the trial court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's action to modify the Florida order and to enter the various visitation and other orders entered in relation to the issue of the

                        found only another child was removed from the mother's custody by child protective services in Oklahoma, and the mother stipulated that the child protective services matter in Oklahoma had been closed, a fact she had a duty to
                        disclose. In re S.E., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 328 (2020).

                        Trial court had exclusive, original jurisdiction over the termination of a parental rights case regarding a child because it properly determined that North Carolina was the home state for the child; the child was born in North Carolina and lived with
                        foster parents in the State for the six months immediately before the filing of the termination of parental rights petition, and for the entirety of her life, the child lived in North Carolina. In re N.P.,

                        Trial court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction because regardless of any temporary emergency jurisdiction exercised during the initial period of the child's life or during the time leading up to her adjudication as a dependent and neglected
                        juvenile, it had exclusive, original jurisdiction over all petitions and motions concerning termination of parental rights pursuant to the statute and in conformance with the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to enter a custody order because the action was commenced in North Carolina; even though the father, mother, and child moved out of the State shortly after the initiation of the suit, North Carolina retained its jurisdiction
                        under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) until the conclusion of the matter, and that continuity promoted the UCCJEA's purpose of avoiding jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of
                        other States. Waly v. Alkamary, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 17, 2021).

                        Exercise of Jurisdiction Declined. - Vermont family court order, which directed custody to a father was upheld, and a North Carolina court properly declined jurisdiction, where there was no question that the parties' minor children were living in Vermont
                        for the required six months prior to the commencement of the mother's custody proceeding in North Carolina. Vermont qualified as the children's home state under North Carolina and Vermont law despite a six week absence from Vermont
                        to North Carolina, which was deemed a temporary absence insufficient to prevent the conclusion that Vermont was the home state. Chick v. Chick, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 596 S.E.2d

                        Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and
                        disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the children, the trial court could assert

                        with North Carolina, and there was substantial evidence regarding the children's "present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships" in North Carolina. Pheasant v. McKibben,

                        substantial evidence about the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships was available in North Carolina. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93

                        Fifteen-Month Residence of Child Held Sufficient for Jurisdiction. - Evidence was sufficient to support the court's exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to either former G.S. 50A-3(a)(1) or G.S. 50A-3(2) of this section, where the minor child had resided
                        with the plaintiffs for an almost continuous 15-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the action. This was sufficient to qualify North Carolina as the minor child's home state. The child's brief visit to Texas
                        during this time period was not sufficient to prevent such a conclusion. Plemmons v. Stiles, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 309 S.E.2d 504 (1983).

                        without making findings of fact which support the conclusion that such exercise is required in the interest of the child, if the record shows that the parent seeking the modification has improperly retained the child. Jerson v.

                        "Substantial Evidence" Required. - To be able to enter a well-founded custody order, the trial court must look beyond the declarations of competing parents, seeking to find the real circumstances of the child's welfare. The "substantial" evidence required
                        by former G.S. 50A-3, therefore, must be such as would enable the trial court to look to sources within the State that could address each of the statutory aspects of the child's interest, care, protection, training, and personal
                        relationships. Holland v. Holland, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 286 S.E.2d 895 (1982).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a new section addressing continuing jurisdiction. Continuing jurisdiction was not specifically addressed in the UCCJA. Its absence caused considerable confusion, particularly because the PKPA,
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738(d), requires other States to give Full Faith and Credit to custody determinations made by the original decree State pursuant to the decree State's continuing jurisdiction so long as that State has jurisdiction
                        under its own law and remains the residence of the child or any contestant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section provides the rules of continuing jurisdiction and borrows from UIFSA as well as recent UCCJA case law. The continuing jurisdiction of the original decree State is exclusive. It continues until one of two events occurs:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li id="t50Aa02s50A-202-officialcommentol11">
                            If a parent or a person acting as a parent remains in the original decree State, continuing jurisdiction is lost when neither the child, the child and a parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent continue to have a significant connection with
                            the original decree State and there is no longer substantial evidence concerning the child's care, protection, training and personal relations in that State.  In other words, even if the child has acquired a new home State,
                            the original decree State retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, so long as the general requisites of the "substantial connection" jurisdiction provisions of Section 201 are met.  If the relationship between the child
                            and the person remaining in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction becomes so attenuated that the court could no longer find significant connections and substantial evidence, jurisdiction would no longer exist.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t50Aa02s50A-202-officialcommentol12">
                            Continuing jurisdiction is lost when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent no longer reside in the original decree State.  The exact language of subparagraph (a)(2) was the subject of considerable debate. Ultimately the Conference
                            settled on the phrase that "a court of this State or a court of another State determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this State" to determine when the exclusive,
                            continuing jurisdiction of a State ended.  The phrase is meant to be identical in meaning to the language of the PKPA which provides that full faith and credit is to be given to custody determinations made by a State in the
                            exercise of its continuing jurisdiction when that "State remains the residence of . . . ."  The phrase is also the equivalent of the language "continues to reside" which occurs in UIFSA § 205(a)(1) to determine the exclusive,
                            continuing jurisdiction of the State that made a support order.  The phrase "remains the residence of" in the PKPA has been the subject of conflicting case law.  It is the intention of this Act that paragraph (a)(2) of this
                            section means that the named persons no longer continue to actually live within the State.  Thus, unless a modification proceeding has been commenced, when the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents physically
                            leave the State to live elsewhere, the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction ceases.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The use of the phrase "a court of this State" under subsection (a)(1) makes it clear that the original decree State is the sole determinant of whether jurisdiction continues. A party seeking to modify a custody determination must obtain an order from
                        the original decree State stating that it no longer has jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "do not presently reside" is not used in the sense of a technical domicile. The fact that the original determination State still considers one parent a domiciliary does not prevent it from losing exclusive, continuing jurisdiction after the
                        child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have moved from the State.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have all left the State which made the custody determination prior to the commencement of the modification proceeding, considerations of waste of resources dictate that a court in State B, as
                        well as a court in State A, can decide that State A has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The continuing jurisdiction provisions of this section are narrower than the comparable provisions of the PKPA. That statute authorizes continuing jurisdiction so long as any "contestant" remains in the original decree State and that State continues to
                        have jurisdiction under its own law. This Act eliminates the contestant classification. The Conference decided that a remaining grandparent or other third party who claims a right to visitation, should not suffice to confer exclusive,
                        continuing jurisdiction on the State that made the original custody determination after the departure of the child, the parents and any person acting as a parent. The significant connection to the original decree State must relate
                        to the child, the child and a parent, or the child and a person acting as a parent. This revision does not present a conflict with the PKPA. The PKPA's reference in
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738(d) to
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738(c)(1) recognizes that States may narrow the class of cases that would be subject to exclusive, continuing jurisdiction. However, during the transition from the UCCJA to this Act, some States may continue to
                        base continuing jurisdiction on the continued presence of a contestant, such as a grandparent. The PKPA will require that such decisions be enforced. The problem will disappear as States adopt this Act to replace the UCCJA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a proceeding. If State A had jurisdiction under this section at the time a modification proceeding was commenced there, it would not be lost by all parties moving out of the State prior to the conclusion of
                        proceeding. State B would not have jurisdiction to hear a modification unless State A decided that State B was more appropriate under Section 207.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction is not reestablished if, after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents leave the State, the non-custodial parent returns. As subsection (b) provides, once a State has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction,
                        it can modify its own determination only if it has jurisdiction under the standards of Section 201. If another State acquires exclusive continuing jurisdiction under this section, then its orders cannot be modified even if this
                        State has once again become the home State of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In accordance with the majority of UCCJA case law, the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction may relinquish jurisdiction when it determines that another State would be a more convenient forum under the principles of Section 207.

                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction, under G.S. 50A-203, to modify a Texas custody order because, while the court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order, (1) the Texas court did not find that court no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction
                        or that a North Carolina court was a more convenient forum, and (2) the trial court found the child's mother resided in Texas. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        Trial court was not exercising modification jurisdiction because it was not considering modifying a child-custody determination made by a court of another state; after the father's commencement of the custody action, North Carolina retained its "initial
                        determination" jurisdiction, and because North Carolina was the "home state" of the child for more than six months before the father filed the custody action, North Carolina had jurisdiction to enter the permanent custody order.

                        Temporary Emergency Jurisdiction. - - Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing
                        on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the
                        children, the trial court could assert jurisdiction. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                        Trial Court Erred in Exercising Jurisdiction. - Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order adjudicating a mother's son neglected and dependent and placing him in the custody of a department because there was no finding of fact, order, or other

                        of the proceedings, nor had the children lived in North Carolina within six months of commencement, (2) the children's absence from Utah was not temporary, and (3) the children had not lived in Germany or Florida for six consecutive

                    <p>
                        This section complements Section 202 and is addressed to the court that is confronted with a proceeding to modify a custody determination of another State. It prohibits a court from modifying a custody determination made consistently with this Act by
                        a court in another State unless a court of that State determines that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 or that this State would be a more convenient forum under Section 207. The modification
                        State is not authorized to determine that the original decree State has lost its jurisdiction. The only exception is when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other State.
                        In other words, a court of the modification State can determine that all parties have moved away from the original State. The court of the modification State must have jurisdiction under the standards of Section 201.

                        prerequisites similar to those of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act or has the foreign court declined to exercise jurisdiction to modify the decree? (2) Was the child physically present in North Carolina? (3) Did an emergency

                        Tennessee exercised jurisdiction in accord with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) because a mother participated in the hearing in Tennessee, she lived in Virginia, and none of the parties remained in North Carolina; North
                        Carolina did not need to "release" its jurisdiction as Tennessee properly exercised its jurisdiction to modify visitation under its UCCJEA, which was the same as the North Carolina UCCJEA. In re C.M.B., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d

                        Father failed to show that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify a Delaware court custody order under the UCCJEA where it was undisputed that the child's mother, the father, and the child no longer resided in Delaware when the county
                        department of social services (DSS) filed the juvenile petition, and initial information that the child did not reside in North Carolina was superseded by more accurate information that the child had resided in the state for more
                        than six months before DSS filed the juvenile petition. Thus, North Carolina was the child's home state. In re L.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 567</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 199 (2020).

                        Trial court was not exercising modification jurisdiction because it was not considering modifying a child-custody determination made by a court of another state; after the father's commencement of the custody action, North Carolina retained its "initial
                        determination" jurisdiction, and because North Carolina was the "home state" of the child for more than six months before the father filed the custody action, North Carolina had jurisdiction to enter the permanent custody order.

                        Proper Exercise of Jurisdiction and Modification of Custody Decree. - Mother and children had significant connection to North Carolina and there was substantial evidence in North Carolina. Therefore, North Carolina court correctly determined that North
                        Carolina, not Georgia, was home state. Court did not err in assuming jurisdiction and modifying Georgia custody decree, even though children resided in Georgia and there was no evidence that Georgia had declined jurisdiction. Pheasant

                        Trial court properly found that it had jurisdiction to enter custody and termination orders under circumstances in which, at the time of the petition, the older child was in the custody of the department in North Carolina and had been for 18 months, the
                        mother had earlier moved to North Carolina with the older child, at the date of the petition the mother was incarcerated in North Carolina, and the younger child had no contact with any other state; because the trial court asserted
                        its jurisdiction in the order and the evidence supported its determination, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction. In re T.J.D.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 642 S.E.2d 471

Williams v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite>                        393, 648 S.E.2d 536 (2007).

                        Trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-203(2) to modify a Michigan custody order because North Carolina was the children's "home state" at the time the custody action was initiated, G.S. 50A-102(7), and neither the children nor the
                        mother or father continued to reside in Michigan Crenshaw v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 710 S.E.2d 227 (2011).

                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction, under G.S. 50A-203, to modify a Texas custody order because, while the court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order, (1) the Texas court did not find that court no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction
                        or that a North Carolina court was a more convenient forum, and (2) the trial court found the child's mother resided in Texas. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina court had jurisdiction to modify an Illinois custody order because (1) the North Carolina court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order due to an Illinois judge's transfer of the case to North Carolina since the mother had not
                        lived in Illinois for a number of years and the child's alleged abuse occurred in North Carolina, tantamount to finding North Carolina was the more appropriate forum, (2) the record showed the mother and child had a significant
                        connection with North Carolina other than mere physical presence, and (3) substantial evidence was available in North Carolina as the child's alleged sexual assault and other acts of neglect by the mother occurred in North Carolina,
                        and the Illinois court found North Carolina was a more convenient forum. In re T.R., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 792 S.E.2d 197 (2016).

                        Jurisdiction of Trial Court Proper. - North Carolina was the home state of the child and thus the trial court had jurisdiction to make an initial determination, plus none of the relevant persons were residents of Florida at any time relevant to the jurisdictional
                        analysis; thus, the conditions for modification jurisdiction were met, and the trial court had jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's action to modify the Florida order and to enter the various visitation and other orders entered
                        in relation to the issue of the child's custody. Quevedo-Woolf v. Overholser, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 820 S.E.2d 817 (2018), appeal dismissed, review denied, stay denied,

                        Modification Decree. - Trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-203(2) to modify a Michigan custody order because North Carolina was the children's "home state" at the time the custody action was initiated, G.S. 50A-102(7), and neither
                        the children nor the mother or father continued to reside in Michigan Crenshaw v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 710 S.E.2d 227 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction In Termination of Parental Rights Proceeding. - Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to terminate a father's parental rights because North Carolina was the child's home State since she lived there with the mother, and
                        Virginia no longer possessed exclusive, continuing subject matter jurisdiction; neither the father, the mother, nor the child actually resided in Virginia at the time of the filing of the motion to terminate the father's parental
                        rights. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 767 S.E.2d 905 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and
                        disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the children, the trial court could assert
                        jurisdiction. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Statute did not apply. - No other state has ever entered a custody order as to the child and thus the statute did not apply in this case. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial Court Erred in Exercising Jurisdiction. - The trial court in this State erred in exercising its jurisdiction over a custody matter where a proceeding was already pending in an Indiana court and the child had lived in Indiana since 1981, a period
                        of six years. Indiana was exercising jurisdiction in substantial conformity with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (U.C.C.J.A.), and North Carolina was required to decline jurisdiction over the custody issue. Lynch v.
                        Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 386 S.E.2d 607 (1989).

                        North Carolina court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings to terminate a mother's parental rights, although North Carolina was the home state of the children, because there was nothing in the record showing that the Arkansas court,
                        which had awarded custody to the father, had determined that a North Carolina court would be a more convenient forum under G.S. 50A-207. In re N.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 598
                        S.E.2d 147 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Because a juvenile's mother continued to live in New York, where an original order of custody was made, G.S. 50A-203(2) was not satisfied even though the father and the juvenile had left New York and moved to North Carolina. In re J.W.S.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 669 S.E.2d 850 (2008).

                    <p>
                        North Carolina trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights proceeding because a prior custody order was entered in a court in New Jersey. Although the trial court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the parties
                        and the subject matter, the trial court made no findings of fact which would support this conclusion of law. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 721 S.E.2d 253 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order adjudicating a mother's son neglected and dependent and placing him in the custody of a department because there was no finding of fact, order, or other indication that the New York court involved in prior
                        protective services had opted not to exercise jurisdiction; there was no finding or conclusion concerning status of the New York court's jurisdiction or finding that the North Carolina court met the requirements of G.S. 50A-201(a)(1)
                        or G.S. 50A-201(a)(2) such that it could make a modification under G.S. 50A-203. In re E.J., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 333, 738 S.E.2d 204 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred when the court concluded that an Indiana court relinquished jurisdiction to North Carolina's courts; the first prong of G.S. 50A-203 was the only possible basis for the existence of jurisdiction in North Carolina. In re J.D.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 759 S.E.2d 375 (2014).

                    <p>
                        District court erred in terminating a father's parental rights because it never acquired subject matter jurisdiction sine there was no order from the New Jersey court relieving itself of jurisdiction; because the father continued to reside in New Jersey,
                        the district court did not gain jurisdiction over the case through the statute, and the termination order did not list a specific statute as the basis to issue its order. In re T.E.N., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite>                        461, 798 S.E.2d 792 (2017).

                        District court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify a California court's child-custody determination inasmuch as the California court did not determine that it no longer had exclusive,
                        continuing jurisdiction, neither court made a finding that the mother did not presently reside in California, and the California court had not terminated its jurisdiction. In re D.A.Y., - N.C. App. - , 831 S.E.2d 854 (2019).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of this section are an elaboration of what was formerly Section 3(a)(3) of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-3(a)(3).] It remains, as Professor Bodenheimer's comments to that section noted, "an extraordinary jurisdiction reserved for extraordinary
                        circumstances."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section codifies and clarifies several aspects of what has become common practice in emergency jurisdiction cases under the UCCJA and PKPA. First, a court may take jurisdiction to protect the child even though it can claim neither home State nor
                        significant connection jurisdiction. Second, the duties of States to recognize, enforce and not modify a custody determination of another State do not take precedence over the need to enter a temporary emergency order to protect
                        the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, a custody determination made under the emergency jurisdiction provisions of this section is a temporary order. The purpose of the order is to protect the child until the State that has jurisdiction under Sections 201-203 enters an order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under certain circumstances, however, subsection (b) provides that an emergency custody determination may become a final custody determination. If there is no existing custody determination, and no custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction
                        under Sections 201-203, an emergency custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides, when the State that issues the order becomes the home State of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) is concerned with the temporary nature of the order when there exists a prior custody order that is entitled to be enforced under this Act or when a subsequent custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203.
                        Subsection (c) allows the temporary order to remain in effect only so long as is necessary for the person who obtained the determination under this section to present a case and obtain an order from the State with jurisdiction
                        under Sections 201-203. That time period must be specified in the order. If there is an existing order by a State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203, that order need not be reconfirmed. The temporary emergency determination
                        would lapse by its own terms at the end of the specified period or when an order is obtained from the court with jurisdiction under Sections 202-203. The court with appropriate jurisdiction also may decide, under the provisions
                        of 207, that the court that entered the emergency order is in a better position to address the safety of the person who obtained the emergency order, or the child, and decline jurisdiction under Section 207.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any hearing in the State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203 on the temporary emergency determination is subject to the provisions of Sections 111 and 112. These sections facilitate the presentation of testimony and evidence taken out of State. If
                        there is a concern that the person obtaining the temporary emergency determination under this section would be in danger upon returning to the State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203, these provisions should be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (d) requires communication between the court of the State that is exercising jurisdiction under this section and the court of another State that is exercising jurisdiction under Sections 201-203. The pleading rules of Section 209 apply fully
                        to determinations made under this section. Therefore, a person seeking a temporary emergency custody determination is required to inform the court pursuant to Section 209(d) of any proceeding concerning the child that has been
                        commenced elsewhere. The person commencing the custody proceeding under Sections 201-203 is required under Section 209(a) to inform the court about the temporary emergency proceeding. These pleading requirements are to be strictly
                        followed so that the courts are able to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.

       </b> The definition of emergency has been modified to harmonize it with the PKPA. The PKPA's definition of emergency jurisdiction does not use the term "neglect." It defines an emergency as "mistreatment or abuse." Therefore
                        "neglect" has been eliminated as a basis for the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction. Neglect is so elastic a concept that it could justify taking emergency jurisdiction in a wide variety of cases. Under the PKPA, if
                        a State exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction based on a finding that the child was neglected without a finding of mistreatment or abuse, the order would not be entitled to federal enforcement in other States.

                    <p>
                        <b>
        Relationship to Protective Order Proceedings.
       </b> The UCCJA and the PKPA were enacted long before the advent of state procedures on the use of protective orders to alleviate problems of domestic violence. Issues of custody and visitation often arise within the context
                        of protective order proceedings since the protective order is often invoked to keep one parent away from the other parent and the children when there is a threat of violence. This Act recognizes that a protective order proceeding
                        will often be the procedural vehicle for invoking jurisdiction by authorizing a court to assume temporary emergency jurisdiction when the child's parent or sibling has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order for a protective order that contains a custody determination to be enforceable in another State it must comply with the provisions of this Act and the PKPA. Although the Violence Against Women's Act (VAWA), 18 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2265, does provide an independent basis for the granting of full faith and credit to protective orders, it expressly excludes "custody" orders from the definition of "protective order," 22 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 2266.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many States authorize the issuance of protective orders in an emergency without notice and hearing. This Act does not address the propriety of that procedure. It is left to local law to determine the circumstances under which such an order could be issued,
                        and the type of notice that is required, in a case without an interstate element. However, an order issued after the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under
                        this Act and the PKPA only if there has been notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard as set out in Section 205. Although VAWA does require that full faith and credit be accorded to ex parte protective orders if notice will
                        be given and there will be a reasonable opportunity to be heard, it does not include a "custody" order within the definition of "protective order."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VAWA does play an important role in determining whether an emergency exists. That Act requires a court to give full faith and credit to a protective order issued in another State if the order is made in accordance with the VAWA. This would include those
                        findings of fact contained in the order. When a court is deciding whether an emergency exists under this section, it may not relitigate the existence of those factual findings.

                        Applicability. - This section was not applicable to a petition to terminate a mother's parental rights because the children had not been abandoned within the meaning of the North Carolina Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act and there
                        was no indication that the children were in need of protection. In re N.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 598 S.E.2d 147 (2004).

                        Trial court's adjudication and disposition, custody review, and permanency planning orders were vacated because (1) another state had entered a custody order as to the child, and (2) the trial court did not exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction in
                        entering these orders, as none of the orders stated an adequate time within which to obtain an order from the court that entered the initial custody order, the court did not immediately communicate with that court, and the court
                        did not purport to exercise emergency jurisdiction, as the court merely found the court had jurisdiction. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        and those orders remained in effect pursuant to G.S. 50A-204(b) because no other orders had been entered by another state with jurisdiction. In re E.X.J., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 662 S.E.2d 24 (2008), aff'd,

                        and the child's mother had threatened to kill the child and throw the child out. In re M.B., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 635 S.E.2d 8 (2006).

                        Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Enter Adjudication Order. - Although the trial court did have temporary jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-204(a), to enter the nonsecure custody orders, the trial court did not have jurisdiction, exclusive or temporary, to enter
                        the juvenile adjudication order, because there was no record evidence that the trial court ever communicated with the New York court, which had entered an original custody order as to the juvenile, as mandated by G.S. 50A-204(d)
                        and G.S. 50A-110, to determine if the New York court opted not to exercise jurisdiction. In re J.W.S., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 669 S.E.2d 850 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an order adjudicating a mother's son neglected and dependent and placing him in the custody of a department because there was no finding of fact, order, or other indication that the New York court involved in prior
                        protective services had opted not to exercise jurisdiction; there was no finding or conclusion concerning status of the New York court's jurisdiction or finding that the North Carolina court met the requirements of G.S. 50A-201(a)(1)
                        or G.S. 50A-201(a)(2) such that it could make a modification under G.S. 50A-203. The adjudication and disposition order was also insufficient to invoke temporary emergency jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-204 as the trial court could
                        only have entered an order under its temporary emergency jurisdiction for a specific period of time. In re E.J., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 333, 738 S.E.2d 204 (2013).

                        Specific findings not required. - Mother argued that the trial court acted without proper temporary emergency jurisdiction because it failed to make findings that the child was abandoned or that it was necessary to exercise jurisdiction to protect the
                        child, but the statutory bases for jurisdiction did not require a trial court to make specific findings of fact regarding jurisdiction and the statute states only that certain circumstances must exist, not that the court must specifically
                        make findings to that effect. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                        Emergency jurisdiction proper. - Trial court properly entered the initial nonsecure custody orders pursuant to the court's temporary emergency jurisdiction and properly found the child to be abandoned; the child's mother had been arrested and incarcerated,
                        the child was left without supervision or provision for the child's care, and the trial court found that the department needed to assume custody since the mother would be unable to care for the child and the mother's recommended
                        placement had pending criminal charges, including sexual offenses against a child. In re N.T.U., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 760 S.E.2d 49 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial court had temporary emergency jurisdiction to enter a child custody order because the court found the child was exposed to a substantial risk of physical injury or sexual abuse as the parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker had created conditions
                        likely to cause injury or abuse or had failed to provide, or was unable to provide, adequate supervision or protection. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly exercised subject-matter jurisdiction regarding a father's parental rights on a temporary emergency basis because his children lived in North Carolina for more than a year prior to the hearing on pre-adjudication, adjudication, and
                        disposition, and thus, North Carolina qualified as their "home state"; once a Michigan court determined North Carolina would be a more convenient forum and relinquished jurisdiction over the children, the trial court could assert
                        jurisdiction. In re A.L.L., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 802 S.E.2d 598 (2017).

        Procedures Followed.
       </b> - Trial court followed the procedures in communicating with the court in Tennessee based upon allegations of potential harm to a child, and because both judges agreed the case could proceed in Tennessee, the trial court
                        properly "stayed" the mother's motions and purported to "transfer" the case to Tennessee; there was no indication that the child was present the State for the trial court to exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction under the Uniform
                        Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. In re C.M.B., - N.C. App. - , 826 S.E.2d 810 (2019).

                    <p>
                        This section generally continues the notice provisions of the UCCJA. However, it does not attempt to dictate who is entitled to notice. Local rules vary with regard to persons entitled to seek custody of a child. Therefore, this section simply indicates
                        that persons entitled to seek custody should receive notice but leaves the rest of the determination to local law. Parents whose parental rights have not been previously terminated and persons having physical custody of the child
                        are specifically mentioned as persons who must be given notice. The PKPA,
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738A(e), requires that they be given notice in order for the custody determination to be entitled to full faith and credit under that Act.

                    <p>
                        State laws also vary with regard to whether a court has the power to issue an enforceable temporary custody order without notice and hearing in a case without any interstate element. Such temporary orders may be enforceable, as against due process objections,
                        for a short period of time if issued as a protective order or a temporary restraining order to protect a child from harm. Whether such orders are enforceable locally is beyond the scope of this Act. Subsection (b) clearly provides
                        that the validity of such orders and the enforceability of such orders is governed by the law which authorizes them and not by this Act. An order is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under this Act only if
                        there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard. The PKPA,
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738A(e), also requires that a custody determination is entitled to full faith and credit only if there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard.

                        Rules requiring joinder of people with an interest in the custody of and visitation with a child also vary widely throughout the country. The UCCJA has a separate section on joinder of parties which has been eliminated. The issue of who is entitled to
                        intervene and who must be joined in a custody proceeding is to be determined by local state law.

                        Adequacy of Notice. - Trial court's judgment to modify a child custody award and award sole custody of the minor children to the mother was affirmed because the father admitted that he was on actual notice that a motion to modify custody was set to be
                        heard, but was continued to some date in the future in order to accommodate his need to find new counsel. In addition, he had actual notice of the scheduled court date for the hearing days prior to leaving for a planned vacation,
                        but chose to proceed with the trip rather than attend the hearing; therefore, he had adequate notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard. Trivette v. Trivette, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>                        55, 590 S.E.2d 298 (2004).

                        Notice Held Sufficient. - Mother had received adequate notice that the hearing would include changes to the visitation schedule since the father had moved the court for an order finding and holder the mother in contempt for her disobedience and failure
                        to comply with the provision of prior orders entered in the case. Anderson v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 593 S.E.2d 87 (2004).

                        Father's argument that he did not receive notice was rejected where although the county department of social services did not ultimately file a motion in the initial adjudication proceeding to terminate his rights, it had filed a separate petition to
                        terminate those rights and properly served him with a summons, and the petition. In re E.X.J., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 34, 662 S.E.2d 24 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 9</cite>,

                        In a child custody case in which a mother appealed an order modifying custody, she unsuccessfully argued that the hearing supporting the order was held without proper notice to her. The record showed that the father's counsel mailed the father's motion
                        for modification and notice of hearing for the October 25, 2007 hearing on September 28, 2007, and the mother's numerous responses to the motion to modify custody indicated that she was well aware that the custody matter was scheduled
                        for hearing on October 25, 2007. Mitchell v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 681 S.E.2d 520 (2009).

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This section represents the remnants of the simultaneous proceedings provision of the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 6 [former G.S. 50A-6.] The problem of simultaneous proceedings is no longer a significant issue. Most of the problems have been resolved by the prioritization of home state jurisdiction under Section 201; the exclusive,
                        continuing jurisdiction provisions of Section 202; and the prohibitions on modification of Section 203. If there is a home State, there can be no exercise of significant connection jurisdiction in an initial child custody determination
                        and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings. If there is a State of exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, there cannot be another State with concurrent jurisdiction and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings. Of course, the home
                        State, as well as the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, could defer to another State under Section 207. However, that decision is left entirely to the home State or the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under this Act, the simultaneous proceedings problem will arise only when there is no home State, no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction and more than one significant connection State. For those cases, this section retains the "first in time"
                        rule of the UCCJA. Subsection (b) retains the UCCJA's policy favoring judicial communication. Communication between courts is required when it is determined that a proceeding has been commenced in another State.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) concerns the problem of simultaneous proceedings in the State with modification jurisdiction and enforcement proceedings under Article 3. This section authorizes the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to stay the modification
                        proceeding pending the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, to enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding, or to continue the modification proceeding under such conditions as it determines are appropriate.
                        The court may wish to communicate with the enforcement court. However, communication is not mandatory. Although the enforcement State is required by the PKPA to enforce according to its terms a custody determination made consistently
                        with the PKPA, that duty is subject to the decree being modified by a State with the power to do so under the PKPA. An order to enjoin the parties from enforcing the decree is the equivalent of a temporary modification by a State
                        with the authority to do so. The concomitant provision addressed to the enforcement court is Section 306 of this Act. That section requires the enforcement court to communicate with the modification court in order to determine
                        what action the modification court wishes the enforcement court to take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "pending" that was utilized in the UCCJA section on simultaneous proceeding has been replaced. It has caused considerable confusion in the case law. It has been replaced with the term "commencement of the proceeding" as more accurately reflecting
                        the policy behind this section. The latter term is defined in Section 102(5).

                        Duty to Contact State With Original Jurisdiction. - In a proceeding by the Department of Social Services seeking protective custody of a child based on evidence of sexual abuse by the father, the trial court was required to contact the appropriate Florida

                        state of the children; there was no evidence that the children had a "significant connection" with California or that "substantial evidence" was available in California concerning the children's care; and there was significant

                        Although the child resided in North Carolina, the court properly declined jurisdiction because the father continued to reside in the state of the court of original jurisdiction; thus, the Florida court retained jurisdiction under the Parental Kidnapping

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This section retains the focus of Section 7 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-7.] It authorizes courts to decide that another State is in a better position to make the custody determination, taking into consideration the relative circumstances of the parties.
                        If so, the court may defer to the other State.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The list of factors that the court may consider has been updated from the UCCJA. The list is not meant to be exclusive. Several provisions require comment. Subparagraph (1) is concerned specifically with domestic violence and other matters affecting the
                        health and safety of the parties. For this purpose, the court should determine whether the parties are located in different States because one party is a victim of domestic violence or child abuse. If domestic violence or child
                        abuse has occurred, this factor authorizes the court to consider which State can best protect the victim from further violence or abuse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In applying subparagraph (3), courts should realize that distance concerns can be alleviated by applying the communication and cooperation provisions of Sections 111 and 112.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In applying subsection (7) on expeditious resolution of the controversy, the court could consider the different procedural and evidentiary laws of the two States, as well as the flexibility of the court dockets. It also should consider the ability of
                        a court to arrive at a solution to all the legal issues surrounding the family. If one State has jurisdiction to decide both the custody and support issues, it would be desirable to determine that State to be the most convenient
                        forum. The same is true when children of the same family live in different States. It would be inappropriate to require parents to have custody proceedings in several States when one State could resolve the custody of all the children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before determining whether to decline or retain jurisdiction, the court of this State may communicate, in accordance with Section 110, with a court of another State and exchange information pertinent to the assumption of jurisdiction by either court.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two departures from Section 7 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-7.] First, the court may not simply dismiss the action. To do so would leave the case in limbo. Rather the court shall stay the case and direct the parties to file in the State that
                        has been found to be the more convenient forum. The court is also authorized to impose any other conditions it considers appropriate. This might include the issuance of temporary custody orders during the time necessary to commence
                        a proceeding in the designated State, dismissing the case if the custody proceeding is not commenced in the other State or resuming jurisdiction if a court of the other State refuses to take the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, UCCJA,
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 7(g) [former G.S. 50A-7(g)] which allowed the court to assess fees and costs if it was a clearly inappropriate court, has been eliminated. If a court has jurisdiction under this Act, it could not be a clearly inappropriate
                        court.

                        under G.S. 50A-201(a)(2) as litigation in North Carolina did not establish such jurisdiction. Gerhauser v. Van Bourgondien, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 767 S.E.2d 378 (2014).

                        No Order Stating North Carolina Would Be A More Convenient Forum. - North Carolina court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings to terminate a mother's parental rights under G.S. 50A-203, although North Carolina was the home state
                        of the children, because there was nothing in the record showing that the Arkansas court, which had awarded custody to the father, had determined that a North Carolina court would be a more convenient forum. In re N.R.M.,

                        New York court in the record showing that New York made a determination that North Carolina, where the father had taken the juvenile, was a more convenient forum. In re J.W.S., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite>                        439, 669 S.E.2d 850 (2008).

                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction, under G.S. 50A-203, to modify a Texas custody order because, while the court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order, (1) the Texas court did not find that court no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction
                        or that a North Carolina court was a more convenient forum, and (2) the trial court found the child's mother resided in Texas. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 780 S.E.2d 228 (2015).

                        North Carolina Properly Found to Be An Inconvenient Forum. - Trial court properly determined that North Carolina was an inconvenient forum pursuant to G.S. 50A-207 for a mother's child custody motion and transferred the matter to Ohio, as the evidence
                        supported the court's finding that the child had adjusted to her placement with her father in Ohio, and that the majority of the evidence was located in Ohio, and the matter was still pending before the court, because an underlying
                        dependency action vested the trial court with continuing subject matter jurisdiction until the child was 18 years of age. In re M.E., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 638 S.E.2d 513 (2007),

                        Forum Appropriate. - Where the trial court made 15 detailed findings of fact including findings that support was paid by the defendant in North Carolina, three of the four parties live in Wilmington, North Carolina, and the plaintiff was moving to Virginia
                        allegedly to go to school, these findings were sufficient to show that North Carolina was a convenient forum for the continued exercise of jurisdiction. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite>                        292, 465 S.E.2d 44 (1996).

                        Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in denying a mother's motion to transfer, pursuant to G.S. 50A-207, a custody matter from North Carolina to California because the trial court's findings showed that the court considered relevant factors
                        in determining whether jurisdiction was to be transferred and the findings were sufficient. Velasquez v. Ralls, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 665 S.E.2d 825 (2008).

                        North Carolina court had jurisdiction to modify an Illinois custody order because (1) the North Carolina court had jurisdiction to enter an initial custody order due to an Illinois judge's transfer of the case to North Carolina since the mother had not
                        lived in Illinois for a number of years and the child's alleged abuse occurred in North Carolina, tantamount to finding North Carolina was the more appropriate forum, (2) the record showed the mother and child had a significant
                        connection with North Carolina other than mere physical presence, and (3) substantial evidence was available in North Carolina as the child's alleged sexual assault and other acts of neglect by the mother occurred in North Carolina,
                        and the Illinois court found North Carolina was a more convenient forum. In re T.R., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 792 S.E.2d 197 (2016).

                        Trial court properly granted a mother's motion to remove to the State of Ohio as North Carolina was an inconvenient forum because it considered the relevant factors in the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act and made appropriate findings
                        of fact on those factors based on the evidence the parties chose to submit. Harter v. Eggleston, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 4, 2020).

                        Findings Required. - Trial court's order transferring jurisdiction to Michigan, ending review hearings, and not returning custody to the parents was reversed and the matter was remanded because the court failed to make necessary statutory findings to
                        support its decision and failed to set out an adequate visitation schedule. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 750 S.E.2d 50 (2013).

        Motion to Stay.
       </b> - Even if a mother's letter was considered a proper motion to stay proceedings, because the trial court never entered an order ruling the mother's "motion to stay" letter, the court of appeals not have jurisdiction
                        to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by not granting a stay under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act; the letter was not filed stamped or served on the father's counsel prior to the
                        hearing and did not identify any legal basis for the stay. Waly v. Alkamary, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 17, 2021).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The "Clean Hands" section of the UCCJA has been truncated in this Act. Since there is no longer a multiplicity of jurisdictions which could take cognizance of a child-custody proceeding, there is less of a concern that one parent will take the child to
                        another jurisdiction in an attempt to find a more favorable forum. Most of the jurisdictional problems generated by abducting parents should be solved by the prioritization of home State in Section 201; the exclusive, continuing
                        jurisdiction provisions of Section 202; and the ban on modification in Section 203. For example, if a parent takes the child from the home State and seeks an original custody determination elsewhere, the stay-at-home parent has
                        six months to file a custody petition under the extended home state jurisdictional provision of Section 201, which will ensure that the case is retained in the home State. If a petitioner for a modification determination takes
                        the child from the State that issued the original custody determination, another State cannot assume jurisdiction as long at the first State exercises exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nonetheless, there are still a number of cases where parents, or their surrogates, act in a reprehensible manner, such as removing, secreting, retaining, or restraining the child. This section ensures that abducting parents will not receive an advantage
                        for their unjustifiable conduct. If the conduct that creates the jurisdiction is unjustified, courts must decline to exercise jurisdiction that is inappropriately invoked by one of the parties. For example, if one parent abducts
                        the child pre-decree and establishes a new home State, that jurisdiction will decline to hear the case. There are exceptions. If the other party has acquiesced in the court's jurisdiction, the court may hear the case. Such acquiescence
                        may occur by filing a pleading submitting to the jurisdiction, or by not filing in the court that would otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act. Similarly, if the court that would have jurisdiction finds that the court of this
                        State is a more appropriate forum, the court may hear the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section applies to those situations where jurisdiction exists because of the unjustified conduct of the person seeking to invoke it. If, for example, a parent in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 has either restrained
                        the child from visiting with the other parent, or has retained the child after visitation, and seeks to modify the decree, this section in inapplicable. The conduct of restraining or retaining the child did not create jurisdiction.
                        Jurisdiction existed under this Act without regard to the parent's conduct. Whether a court should decline to hear the parent's request to modify is a matter of local law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The focus in this section is on the unjustified conduct of the person who invokes the jurisdiction of the court. A technical illegality or wrong is insufficient to trigger the applicability of this section. This is particularly important in cases involving
                        domestic violence and child abuse. Domestic violence victims should not be charged with unjustifiable conduct for conduct that occurred in the process of fleeing domestic violence, even if their conduct is technically illegal.
                        Thus, if a parent flees with a child to escape domestic violence and in the process violates a joint custody decree, the case should not be automatically dismissed under this section. An inquiry must be made into whether the flight
                        was justified under the circumstances of the case. However, an abusive parent who seizes the child and flees to another State to establish jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct and the new State must decline to exercise
                        jurisdiction under this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) authorizes the court to fashion an appropriate remedy for the safety of the child and to prevent a repetition of the unjustified conduct. Thus, it would be appropriate for the court to notify the other parent and to provide for foster care
                        for the child until the child is returned to the other parent. The court could also stay the proceeding and require that a custody proceeding be instituted in another State that would have jurisdiction under this Act. It should
                        be noted that the court is not making a forum non conveniens analysis in this section. If the conduct is unjustifiable, it must decline jurisdiction. It may, however, retain jurisdiction until a custody proceeding is commenced
                        in the appropriate tribunal if such retention is necessary to prevent a repetition of the wrongful conduct or to ensure the safety of the child.

                        Findings of Court Where Child Is Improperly Retained in This State. - Even when the district court has jurisdiction over the person of the out-of-state parent in an action to modify a foreign custody decree, it has no authority to exercise its jurisdiction
                        without making findings of fact which support the conclusion that such exercise is required in the interest of the child, if the record shows that the parent seeking the modification has improperly retained the child. Jerson v.

                        Findings Where Child Is Abducted. - The trial court was not required by former G.S. 50A-8 to decline jurisdiction of a proceeding to modify a Virginia child custody decree merely because the mother had abducted one of the children and had taken her to
                        this State if the court properly determined that it was in the best interest of the children that the court exercise jurisdiction despite the abduction; however, as the trial court's conclusion that it should exercise jurisdiction
                        was unsupported by findings of fact, the case would be remanded for such findings. Williams v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 281 S.E.2d 777 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 733</cite>,

                        Mother Acquiesced to Jurisdiction In State. - Even assuming, arguendo, that the grandmother was a person seeking to invoke jurisdiction in North Carolina, and that she engaged in unjustifiable conduct by moving with the child to North Carolina, the mother
                        clearly acquiesced to the jurisdiction of North Carolina by registering the Florida order in North Carolina, and by filing her action here, and none of the orders were void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Quevedo-Woolf

                        Significant Connection Jurisdiction Not Declined. - It was error for a North Carolina trial court to exercise custody modification jurisdiction because, inter alia, North Carolina had no jurisdiction under G.S. 50A-201(a)(3) or (4) as Utah or Florida
                        had not declined their "significant connection" jurisdiction. Gerhauser v. Van Bourgondien, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 767 S.E.2d 378 (2014).

                        California court did not obtain jurisdiction over child custody proceedings substantially in conformity with this Chapter where North Carolina rather than California was the home state of the children; there was no evidence that the children had a "significant
                        connection" with California or that "substantial evidence" was available in California concerning the children's care; and there was significant evidence that defendant had on several occasions taken the children from North Carolina

                        The pleading requirements from Section 9 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-9] are generally carried over into this Act. However, the information is made subject to local law on the protection of names and other identifying information in certain cases. A
                        number of States have enacted laws relating to the protection of victims in domestic violence and child abuse cases which provide for the confidentiality of victims names, addresses, and other information. These procedures must
                        be followed if the child-custody proceeding of the State requires their applicability. See, e.g., California Family Law Code

       </span> 3409(a). If a State does not have local law that provides for protecting names and addresses, then subsection (e) or a similar provision should be adopted. Subsection (e) is based on the National Council of Juvenile
                        and Family Court Judge's, Model Code on Domestic and Family Violence
                        <span class="s2">

                    <p>
                        In subsection (a)(2), the term "proceedings" should be read broadly to include more than custody proceedings. Thus, if one parent was being criminally prosecuted for child abuse or custodial interference, those proceedings should be disclosed. If the
                        child is subject to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, facts relating to compliance with the Compact should be disclosed in the pleading or affidavit.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) has been added. It authorizes the court to stay the proceeding until the information required in subsection (a) has been disclosed, although failure to provide the information does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear the case.
                        This follows the majority of jurisdictions which held that failure to comply with the pleading requirements of the UCCJA did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a custody determination.

                        Former G.S. 50A-9 required that every party in a custody pleading give information under oath regarding the children's present address, the places where they lived within the last five years, and the names and present addresses of the persons with whom
                        the children lived during that period. Bhatti v. Bhatti, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 391 S.E.2d 201 (1990).

                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction - Even where the juvenile petition filed by the county social services department failed to attach an affidavit as to the status of the minor child, the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the minor child's
                        neglect and dependency proceeding; although the better practice was to attach the affidavit, the failure to file the affidavit did not by itself divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re D.S.A.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18 (2007).

                        the trial court of jurisdiction because nothing in the statute suggested that the information to be provided in this affidavit was jurisdictional; to the contrary, much statutory language led to the opposite conclusion because:
                        (1) the information was required only if reasonably ascertainable; (2) if the information was not furnished at the outset, the court could stay the proceeding until the information was furnished; and (3) the statute required both
                        parties to submit the information, and it would defy reason to suggest that a parent could defeat the court's jurisdiction by his or her own noncompliance with the statute. In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>,

                        Inaccuracy in address information for the children named in an affidavit supporting an abuse and neglect petition did not lead to lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the required information was known to the parents and was provided during the
                        course of the hearing. In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 536, 653 S.E.2d 581 (2007), aff'd in part and rev'd in part <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 958 (N.C. Ct. App.

                        Trial court's orders granting the county department of social services (DSS) custody of a child were not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it was reasonable to infer that Oklahoma did not have continuing jurisdiction; the trial court
                        found only another child was removed from the mother's custody by child protective services in Oklahoma, and the mother stipulated that the child protective services matter in Oklahoma had been closed, a fact she had a duty to
                        disclose. In re S.E., - N.C. - , 838 S.E.2d 328 (2020).

                        Proper Exercise of Jurisdiction Despite Noncompliance with Oath Requirements. - Court of appeals declined to accept plaintiff 's argument that failure to comply fully with former G.S. 50A-9's oath requirements defeated the court's subject matter jurisdiction.

                        Failure of a county department of social services to comply with G.S. 50A-209 by failing to file an affidavit with the petition to terminate parental rights did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction in the termination proceeding; furthermore, the
                        trial court was not required to stay the proceedings because the trial court's allowing the county department five days to file the affidavit was not prejudicial to the mother, as the trial court was able to determine whether jurisdiction
                        existed prior to rendering its decision. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 75, 582 S.E.2d 657 (2003).

                        Purpose of Oath Requirement. - An obvious purpose of the requirement of former G.S. 50A-9 that certain information be presented under oath was to enable the court to determine whether it should properly exercise jurisdiction, under the former UCCJA, of

                        No major changes have been made to this section which was Section 11 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-11.] Language was added to subsection (a) to authorize the court to require a non-party who has physical custody of the child to produce the child.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) authorizes the court to enter orders providing for the safety of the child and the person ordered to appear with the child. If safety is a major concern, the court, as an alternative to ordering a party to appear with the child, could order
                        and arrange for the party's testimony to be taken in another State under Section 111. This alternative might be important when there are safety concerns regarding requiring victims of domestic violence or child abuse to travel
                        to the jurisdiction where the abuser resides.

                        This section applies the enforcement remedies provided by this article to orders requiring the return of a child issued under the authority of the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 11601 et seq., implementing the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Specific mention of ICARA proceedings is necessary because they often occur prior to any formal custody determination.
                        However, the need for a speedy enforcement remedy for an order to return the child is just as necessary.

                    <p>
                        This section is based on Section 13 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-13] which contained the basic duty to enforce. The language of the original section has been retained and the duty to enforce is generally the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enforcement of custody determinations of issuing States is also required by federal law in the PKPA, 28 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738A(a). The changes made in Article 2 of this Act now make a State's duty to enforce and not modify a child custody determination of another State consistent with the enforcement and nonmodification provisions
                        of the PKPA. Therefore custody determinations made by a State pursuant to the UCCJA that would be enforceable under the PKPA will generally be enforced under this Act. However, if a State custody determination made pursuant to
                        the UCCJA would not be enforceable under the PKPA, it will also not be enforceable under this Act. Thus a custody determination made by a "significant connection" jurisdiction when there is a home State is not enforceable under
                        the PKPA regardless of whether a proceeding was ever commenced in the home State. Even though such a determination would be enforceable under the UCCJA with its four concurrent bases of jurisdiction, it would not be enforceable
                        under this Act. This carries out the policy of the PKPA of strongly discouraging a State from exercising its concurrent "significant connection" jurisdiction under the UCCJA when another State could exercise "home state" jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section also incorporates the concept of Section 15 of the UCCJA [former G.S. 50A-15] to the effect that a custody determination of another State will be enforced in the same manner as a custody determination made by a court of this State. Whatever
                        remedies are available to enforce a local determination can be utilized to enforce a custody determination of another State. However, it remains a custody determination of the State that issued it. A child-custody determination
                        of another State is not subject to modification unless the State would have jurisdiction to modify the determination under Article 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The remedies provided by this article for the enforcement of a custody determination will normally be used. This article does not detract from other remedies available under other local law. There is often a need for a number of remedies to ensure that
                        a child-custody determination is obeyed. If other remedies would easily facilitate enforcement, they are still available. The petitioner, for example, can still cite the respondent for contempt of court or file a tort claim for
                        intentional interference with custodial relations if those remedies are available under local law.

                        Appellate Review. - When a mother contested a trial court's jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), the mother's failure to include another state's initial custody order in the appellate record did not bar
                        an appellate court's consideration of the issue because (1) a jurisdictional issue was raised, and (2) the UCCJEA and Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act required North Carolina to recognize another state's valid custody order.

                        This section authorizes a court to issue a temporary order if it is necessary to enforce visitation rights without violating the rules on nonmodification contained in Section 303. Therefore, if there is a visitation schedule provided in the custody determination
                        that was made in accordance with Article 2, a court can issue an order under this section implementing the schedule. An implementing order may include make-up or substitute visitation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A court may also issue a temporary order providing for visitation if visitation was authorized in the custody determination, but no specific schedule was included in the custody determination. Such an order could include a substitution of a specific visitation
                        schedule for "reasonable and seasonable."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, a court may not, under subsection (a)(2) provide for a permanent change in visitation. Therefore, requests for a permanent change in the visitation schedule must be addressed to the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section
                        202 or modification jurisdiction under Section 203. As under Section 204, subsection (b) of this section requires that the temporary visitation order stay in effect only long enough to allow the person who obtained the order to
                        obtain a permanent modification in the State with appropriate jurisdiction under Article 2.

                        This section authorizes a simple registration procedure that can be used to predetermine the enforceability of a custody determination. It parallels the process in UIFSA for the registration of child support orders. It should be as much of an aid to pro
                        se litigants as the registration procedure of UIFSA.

                        A custody determination can be registered without any accompanying request for enforcement. This may be of significant assistance in international cases. For example, the custodial parent under a foreign custody order can receive an advance determination
                        of whether that order would be recognized and enforced before sending the child to the United States for visitation. Article 26 of the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition and Cooperation in Respect
                        of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996), requires those States which accede to the Convention to provide such a procedure.

                        Mother's petition to register a foreign child support order was in substance and form a petition to register a foreign custody order, as her petition did not request registration and enforcement or contain a sworn statement showing the amount of any arrearage,
                        and the trial court did not err in dismissing this claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Even if the court assumed the mother also sought registration under the Uniform Interstate Family Support

                        A registered child-custody determination can be enforced as if it was a child-custody determination of this State. However, it remains a custody determination of the State that issued it. A registered custody order is not subject to modification unless
                        the State would have jurisdiction to modify the order under Article 2.

                        The pleading rules of Section 308, require the parties to disclose any pending proceedings. Normally, an enforcement proceeding will take precedence over a modification action since the PKPA requires enforcement of child custody determinations made in
                        accordance with its terms. However, the enforcement court must communicate with the modification court in order to avoid duplicative litigation. The courts might decide that the court with jurisdiction under Article 2 shall continue
                        with the modification action and stay the enforcement proceeding. Or they might decide that the enforcement proceeding shall go forward. The ultimate decision rests with the court having exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under
                        Section 202, or if there is no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, then the decision rests with the State that would have jurisdiction to modify under Section 203. Therefore, if that court determines that the enforcement
                        proceeding should be stayed or dismissed, the enforcement court should stay or dismiss the proceeding. If the enforcement court does not do so, the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202, or with modification
                        jurisdiction under Section 203, could enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding.

                    <p>
                        This section provides the normal remedy that will be used in interstate cases: the production of the child in a summary, remedial process based on habeas corpus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The petition is intended to provide the court with as much information as possible. Attaching certified copies of all orders sought to be enforced allows the court to have the necessary information. Most of the information relates to the permissible scope
                        of the court's inquiry. The petitioner has the responsibility to inform the court of all proceedings that would affect the current enforcement action. Specific mention is made of certain proceedings to ensure that they are disclosed.
                        A 'procedure relating to domestic violence' includes not only protective order proceedings but also criminal prosecutions for child abuse or domestic violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The order requires the respondent to appear at a hearing on the next judicial day. The term 'next judicial day' in this section means the next day when a judge is at the courthouse. At the hearing, the court will order the child to be delivered to the
                        petitioner unless the respondent is prepared to assert that the issuing State lacked jurisdiction, that notice was not given in accordance with Section 108, or that the order sought to be enforced has been vacated, modified, or
                        stayed by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Article 2. The court is also to order payment of the fees and expenses set out in Section 312. The court may set another hearing to determine whether additional relief available
                        under this state's law should be granted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the order has been registered and confirmed in accordance with Section 304, the only defense to enforcement is that the order has been vacated, stayed or modified since the registration proceeding by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Article
                        2.

                        Interpretation of 20-day Window After Registration. - Nothing in G.S. 50A-305 requires that a party seeking registration of a child-custody determination issued by a court of another state must wait 20 days before registration is effective. Rather, the
                        20-day period provides the time frame during which a party may oppose registration on the grounds provided for in the statute or be limited to the sole ground provided in G.S. 50A-308(d)(2). Chick v. Chick,

                        Procedure. - Under the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, a party wishing to enforce a child-custody determination of another state with jurisdiction must file a petition for enforcement with a court of the state in which the respondent
                        is located. In re Q.V., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 596 S.E.2d 867 (2004).

                        Trial court erred in granting a petition filed by a city department of children's services under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction seeking an order returning a child to Germany because the Hague Convention petition
                        was not verified in violation of the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.S. 50A-308(a), and the failure to verify the petition deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Obo v. Steven B.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 687 S.E.2d 496 (2009).

                        there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing between a juvenile petition and a Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction petition when it comes to the verification requirement; because of the mandatory
                        nature of the remedy under the Hague Convention, which entails removing a child from a parent and returning the child to another country, the interests at stake have the same magnitude and the potential consequences of any error
                        would be just as devastating as with a juvenile petition, and the failure to verify a petition filed pursuant to the Hague Convention deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over that petition. Obo v. Steven B.,

                        Trial Court Lacked Jurisdiction. - Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter any orders in this case because father failed to include certified copies of the Jerusalem Court's provisional and final child custody determinations with his petition;
                        father failed to provide the requisite English translation, nothing indicated that the untranslated document was certified to be an exact reproduction of the Jerusalem Court's original determination, and stamps on the copies reading
                        "Jerusalem Court" was insufficient to render the documents certified true copies. Hamdan v. Freitekh, - N.C. App. - , 844 S.E.2d 338 (2020), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 541</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The scope of inquiry for the enforcing court is quite limited. Federal law requires the court to enforce the custody determination if the issuing state's decree was rendered in compliance with the PKPA. 28 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 1738A(a). This Act requires enforcement of custody determinations that are made in conformity with Article 2's jurisdictional rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The certified copy, or a copy of the certified copy, of the custody determination entitling the petitioner to the child is prima facie evidence of the issuing court's jurisdiction to enter the order. If the order is one that is entitled to be enforced
                        under Article 2 and if it has been violated, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that the custody determination is not entitled to enforcement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a defense to enforcement that another jurisdiction has issued a custody determination that is required to be enforced under Article 2. An example is when one court has based its original custody determination on the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 3(a)(2) [former G.S. 50A-3(a)(2)] (significant connections) and another jurisdiction has rendered an original custody determination based on the UCCJA
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 3(a)(1) [former G.S. 50A-3(a)(1)] (home State). When this occurs, Article 2 of this Act, as well as the PKPA, mandate that the home state determination be enforced in all other States, including the State that rendered
                        the significant connections determination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lack of notice in accordance with Section 108 by a person entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard at the original custody determination is a defense to enforcement of the custody determination. The scope of the defense under this Act is the same
                        as the defense would be under the law of the State that issued the notice. Thus, if the defense of lack of notice would not be available under local law if the respondent purposely hid from the petitioner, took deliberate steps
                        to avoid service of process or elected not to participate in the initial proceedings, the defense would also not be available under this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no other defenses to an enforcement action. If the child would be endangered by the enforcement of a custody or visitation order, there may be a basis for the assumption of emergency jurisdiction under Section 204 of this Act. Upon the finding
                        of an emergency, the court issues a temporary order and directs the parties to proceed either in the court that is exercising continuing jurisdiction over the custody proceeding under Section 202, or the court that would have jurisdiction
                        to modify the custody determination under Section 203.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court shall determine at the hearing whether fees should be awarded under Section 312. If so, it should order them paid. The court may determine if additional relief is appropriate, including requesting law enforcement officers to assist the petitioner
                        in the enforcement of the order. The court may set a hearing to determine whether further relief should be granted.
                    </p>

                        The section provides a remedy for emergency situations where there is a reason to believe that the child will suffer imminent, serious physical harm or be removed from the jurisdiction once the respondent learns that the petitioner has filed an enforcement
                        proceeding. If the court finds such harm exists, it should temporarily waive the notice requirements and issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child. Immediately after the warrant is executed, the respondent is to receive
                        notice of the proceedings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "harm" cannot be totally defined and, as in the issuance of temporary retraining orders, the appropriate issuance of a warrant is left to the circumstances of the case. Those circumstances include cases where the respondent is the subject of
                        a criminal proceeding as well as situations where the respondent is secreting the child in violation of a court order, abusing the child, a flight risk and other circumstances that the court concludes make the issuance of notice
                        a danger to the child. The court must hear the testimony of the petitioner or another witness prior to issuing the warrant. The testimony may be heard in person, via telephone, or by any other means acceptable under local law.
                        The court must State the reasons for the issuance of the warrant. The warrant can be enforced by law enforcement officers wherever the child is found in the State. The warrant may authorize entry upon private property to pick up
                        the child if no less intrusive means are possible. In extraordinary cases, the warrant may authorize law enforcement to make a forcible entry at any hour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warrant must provide for the placement of the child pending the determination of the enforcement proceeding. Since the issuance of the warrant would not occur absent a risk of serious harm to the child, placement cannot be with the respondent. Normally,
                        the child would be placed with the petitioner. However, if placement with the petitioner is not indicated, the court can order any other appropriate placement authorized under the laws of the court's State. Placement with the petitioner
                        may not be indicated if there is a likelihood that the petitioner also will flee the jurisdiction. Placement with the petitioner may not be practical if the petitioner is proceeding through an attorney and is not present before
                        the court.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section authorizes the court to utilize whatever means are available under local law to ensure the appearance of the petitioner and child at the enforcement hearing. Such means might include cash bonds, a surrender of a passport, or whatever the
                        court determines is necessary.

                        This section is derived from the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 11607(b)(3). Normally the court will award fees and costs against the non-prevailing party. Included as expenses are the amount of investigation fees incurred by private persons or by public officials as well as
                        the cost of child placement during the proceedings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The non-prevailing party has the burden of showing that such an award would be clearly inappropriate. Fees and costs may be inappropriate if their payment would cause the parent and child to seek public assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section implements the policies of Section 8(c) of Pub.L. 96-611 (part of the PKPA) which provides that:

                        In furtherance of the purposes of section 1738A of title 28, United States Code [this section], as added by subsection (a) of this section, State courts are encouraged to - (2) award to the person entitled to custody or visitation pursuant to a custody
                        determination which is consistent with the provisions of such section 1738A [this section], necessary travel expenses, attorneys' fees, costs of private investigations, witness fees or expenses, and other expenses incurred in connection
                        with such custody determination . . . .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "prevailing party" is not given a special definition for this Act. Each State will apply its own standard.

                        Recovery of Costs Against County Department of Social Services. - When a child was adjudicated dependent and neglected pursuant to a petition filed by a county department of social services, after which the trial court relinquished jurisdiction to the
                        state in which the child's parents were divorced, the child's father, who was successful in obtaining an award of custody of the child, was not entitled to recover his costs in doing so from the county department because the department
                        was an agency of the state, and costs could not be awarded against the state under this statute unless they were authorized by a law other than the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.S. 50A-101 et seq., which
                        they were not. In re Q.V., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 596 S.E.2d 867 (2004).

                        expenses are sought establishes that the award would be clearly inappropriate, but G.S. 50A-312(b) specifically provides that fees, costs and expenses may not be awarded against a state unless authorized by some law other than

                        The order may be appealed as an expedited civil matter. An enforcement order should not be stayed by the court. Provisions for a stay would defeat the purpose of having a quick enforcement procedure. If there is a risk of serious mistreatment or abuse
                        to the child, a petition to assume emergency jurisdiction must be filed under Section 204. This section leaves intact the possibility of obtaining an extraordinary remedy such as mandamus or prohibition from an appellate court
                        to stay the court's enforcement action. In many States, it is not possible to limit the constitutional authority of appellate courts to issue a stay. However, unless the information before the appellate panel indicates that emergency
                        jurisdiction would be assumed under Section 204, there is no reason to stay the enforcement of the order pending appeal.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Sections 315-317 are derived from the recommendations of the
                        <i>
        Obstacles Study
       </i> that urge a role for public authorities in civil enforcement of custody and visitation determinations. One of the basic policies behind this approach is that, as is the case with child support, the involvement of public
                        authorities will encourage the parties to abide by the terms of the court order. The prosecutor usually would be the most appropriate public official to exercise authority under this section. However, States may locate the authority
                        described in the section in the most appropriate public office for their governmental structure. The authority could be, for example, the Friend of the Court Office or the Attorney General. If the parties know that prosecutors
                        and law enforcement officers are available to help secure the return of a child, the parties may be deterred from interfering with the exercise of rights established by court order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of public authorities should provide a more effective method of remedying violations of the custody determination. Most parties do not have the resources to enforce a custody determination in another jurisdiction. The availability of the prosecutor
                        or other government official as an enforcement agency will help ensure that remedies of this Act can be made available regardless of income level. In addition, the prosecutor may have resources to draw on that are unavailable to
                        the average litigant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The role of the public authorities should generally not begin until there is a custody determination that is sought to be enforced. The Act does not authorize the public authorities to be involved in the action leading up to the making of the custody
                        determination, except when requested by the court, when there is a violation the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, or when the person holding the child has violated a criminal statute. This
                        Act does not mandate that the public authorities be involved in all cases referred to it. There is only so much time and money available for enforcement proceedings. Therefore, the public authorities eventually will develop guidelines
                        to determine which cases will receive priority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The use of civil procedures instead of, or in addition to, filing and prosecuting criminal charges enlarges the prosecutor's options and may provide a more economical and less disruptive means of solving problems of criminal abduction and retention. With
                        the use of criminal proceedings alone, the procedure may be inadequate to ensure the return of the child. The civil options would permit the prosecutor to resolve that recurring and often frustrating problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A concern was expressed about whether allowing the prosecutor to use civil means as a method of settling a child abduction violated either DR 7-105(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility or Model Rule of Professional Responsibility 4.4. Both provisions
                        either explicitly or implicitly disapprove of a lawyer threatening criminal action to gain an advantage in a civil case. However, the prohibition relates to threats that are solely to gain an advantage in a civil case. If the prosecutor
                        has a good faith reason for pursuing the criminal action, there is no ethical violation. See
                        <i>
        Committee on Legal Ethics v. Printz
       </i> , 416 S.E.2d 720 (W.Va. 1992) (lawyer can threaten to press criminal charges against a client's former employee unless employee made restitution).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It must be emphasized that the public authorities do not become involved in the merits of the case. They are authorized only to locate the child and enforce the custody determination. The public authority is authorized by this section to utilize any civil
                        proceeding to secure the enforcement of the custody determination. In most jurisdictions, that would be a proceeding under this Act. If the prosecutor proceeds pursuant to this Act, the prosecutor is subject to its provisions.
                        There is nothing in this Act that would prevent a State from authorizing the prosecutor or other public official to use additional remedies beyond those provided in this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The public authority does not represent any party to the custody determination. It acts as a "friend of the court." Its role is to ensure that the custody determination is enforced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 315-317 are limited to cases covered by this Act, i.e. interstate cases. However, States may, if they wish, extend this part of the Act to intrastate cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It should also be noted that the provisions of this section relate to the civil enforcement of child custody determinations. Nothing in this section is meant to detract from the ability of the prosecutor to use criminal provisions in child abduction cases.

                        One of the major problems of utilizing public officials to locate children and enforce custody and visitation determinations is cost. This section authorizes the prosecutor and law enforcement to recover costs against the non-prevailing party. The use
                        of the term "direct" indicates that overhead is not a recoverable cost. This section cannot be used to recover the value of the time spent by the public authorities' attorneys.

                    <p>
                        The UDPCVA establishes one umbrella term, "custodial responsibility," for all issues relating to custody, including the responsibility often referred to in other state custody law as physical custody, visitation, and legal custody. The Act also establishes
                        three sub-categories of custodial responsibility that can be transferred to others during deployment: "caretaking authority," "decision-making authority," and "limited contact." The terminology used for each of these sub-categories
                        is original to the UDPCVA. The term "caretaking authority" is meant to encompass the authority to live with, spend time with, or visit with a child. States often use a number of terms that fall within this definition, including
                        "primary physical custody," "secondary physical custody," "visitation," and "possessory conservatorship." All these are meant to be subsumed under the term "caretaking authority."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, the term "decision-making authority" means the authority to make decisions about a child's life beyond the authority that ordinarily accompanies a transfer of caretaking authority under state custody law. This term is meant to encompass the
                        authority referred to in many states as "legal custody," including the authority reasonably necessary to make decisions such as the ability to enroll the child in a local school, to deal with health care, to participate in religious
                        training, and to allow the child to engage in extracurricular activities and travel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the term "limited contact" refers to a form of visitation with the child given to nonparents on the request of a deployed service member. This type of visitation allows the service member to sustain his or her relationship with the child through
                        designating either a family member or other person with whom the child has a close relationship to spend time with the child during the service member's absence. The limited contact definition allows the possibility that it may
                        be granted to minors as well as adults. Thus a minor half-sibling or step-sibling of the child could be granted limited contact during a service member's deployment. This type of contact with the child is a more limited form of
                        visitation than courts usually grant to parents or grandparents outside the deployment context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definitional section in the UDPCVA also uses the term "parent." This term is intended to encompass any of the ways in which the law of the forum state allows parenting relationships to be established. For example, if the law of the relevant state
                        allows parenthood to be established based on the fact that a child has been born or conceived within a civil union, this would meet the UDPCVA's definition of parent. Similarly, the term may encompass persons who are not biological
                        parents but have relied on assisted reproductive technology to bear a child, if their relationship to the child would be recognized as a parental relationship under the law of the state. In addition, persons who meet the definition
                        of de facto or psychological parents could also fall within the definition of "parent," if the law of the relevant state recognizes such a status as a parental status. The term "family member" is also meant to be broadly construed
                        in order to encompass any of the ways that family relationships may be established under state law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "deploying parent" requires notice of deployment. This notice need not be pursuant to the issuance of official orders. Instead, notice is intended to be construed broadly, and includes being advised by a commanding officer or a designated
                        representative that a determination of deployment had been made and that orders of deployment will be issued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Act recognizes that there will be instances in which two of the children's parents may be deployed at the same time. In these circumstances, each parent will simultaneously meet the definition of a "deploying parent" and an "other parent" for purposes
                        of the UDPCVA.

                        This section has two primary functions: First, it declares that courts may enter an order pursuant to the UDPCVA only if the court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). An exception is made allowing
                        for the exercise of temporary jurisdiction by a court in the case of emergencies.

                    <p>
                        Second, the section provides that once either the court has entered a temporary order for custodial responsibility on account of a service member's deployment, or the parties have entered into a temporary agreement for custody during deployment that alters
                        a permanent custody order, for purposes of the UCCJEA's exclusive, continuing jurisdiction provision, the deploying parent's residence will not be changed on account of the deployment itself. This section is not intended to prohibit
                        the court from using other indicia of change of residence of the deployed parent aside from the deployment itself, including buying or selling a home, or changing voter registration, that would ordinarily be considered in determining
                        residence under the UCCJEA.

                        As suggested in the Comment to Section 102, the term "notice of deployment" is intended to be construed broadly to encourage parents to communicate as soon as possible after a service member learns of deployment. This notice need not be pursuant to the
                        issuance of official orders. It is intended to include a service member having been advised by the commanding officer or a designated representative that a determination of deployment has been made and that orders of deployment
                        will be issued. Furthermore, notice of deployment should be construed as given where the commanding officer or a designated representative has informed the service member that there is a reasonable possibility that the service
                        member or the service member's unit will be deployed in the next few months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement in subsection (b) that plans regarding custodial responsibility during deployment be communicated to the other parent applies not only to family care plans developed by service members, but to any other plan for custodial responsibility
                        during deployment formulated by either parent.

                        Article 2 provides procedures for out-of-court resolution of issues of custodial responsibility that arise on the deployment of a service member. This Article is intended to encourage and facilitate the parents mutually agreeing to a custody arrangement
                        during deployment. Most of the Article governs the form and substance of agreements between the parents regarding custody during deployment. In the event that a deploying parent is the only parent with custodial responsibility
                        of the child, section 204 [G.S. 50A-363] allows custody arrangements during the service member's deployment to be made unilaterally by power of attorney.

                        When the parents do not reach agreement out of court on custody or visitation arrangements during deployment, Article 3 provides for judicial resolution of these issues. Due to the fact that the period between notice of deployment and actual deployment
                        may be short, the UDPCVA does not require that the parents attempt to reach an agreement pursuant to Article 2 before filing in court pursuant to this Article; instead, Articles 2 and 3 are alternative mechanisms by which custody
                        and visitation issues can be resolved. Article 3 provides a set of expedited procedures for entry of a temporary custody order during deployment. It also declares that no permanent custody order can be entered before or during
                        deployment without the service member's consent.

                    <p>
                        Section 305 [G.S. 50A-373] governs the court's consideration of a past judicial decree or agreement between the parents that specifically contemplates custody during a service member's deployment. In crafting this provision, the UDPCVA seeks to give significant
                        deference to past decrees and agreements in which issues of custody during deployment have already been considered and resolved. At the same time, it seeks to balance the value of certainty gained by leaving settled matters settled
                        against the recognition that in some circumstances past determinations may no longer be in the best interest of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This provision gives somewhat more deference to custody provisions in prior judicial decrees than in out-of-court agreements. To overturn the former, the challenger must first meet the state's standard for modifying a judicial decree regarding custodial
                        responsibility. In most states, this standard requires that there be a showing of a substantial or material change of circumstances that was not foreseeable at the time the prior judicial decree was entered. Only if a challenger
                        meets that showing, as well as overcomes the presumption that the previous decree was in the best interest of the child, may the court modify the earlier decree. In contrast, the challenger of a custody provision established in
                        a past agreement needs only to overcome the presumption that the provision is in the best interest of the child.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 306 [G.S. 50A-374] allows the court, at the request of a deploying parent, to grant the service member's portion of custodial responsibility in the form of caretaking authority to an adult nonparent who is either a family member or with whom the
                        child has a close and substantial relationship. The UDPCVA establishes no presumption for a grant of custodial responsibility between such a nonparent and the child's other parent. Instead, the court is directed to make the decision
                        based on the best interest of the child. This standard accords with the view that such a grant of custody constitutes a delegation of the service member's custodial rights, and is within the rights of a custodial parent. At the
                        time of drafting of the UDPCVA, courts that had considered the issue of whether deployed parents could delegate their custodial rights to a nonparent had determined that such delegation did not constitute an award of custody to
                        a nonparent that would violate the other parents' constitutional rights to custody in their children. If courts in a state reached a contrary result based either on the state or federal constitution, this determination would be
                        incorporated into section 306 through subsection (a)'s requirement that a grant of custodial responsibility be "in accordance with law of this state other than this [act]." The result would be that a court could grant custody to
                        a nonparent under section 306 only where an exception applied to the constitutional rule of custody in a parent and such a grant was in the best interest of the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a)'s requirement that a grant of custodial responsibility be "in accordance with law of this state other than this [act]" is also intended to incorporate other relevant custody law in the state. For example, it is expected that the court will
                        incorporate presumptions in other state law against granting custodial responsibility to perpetrators of domestic violence or to sexual offenders, or to those who reside with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Section 306 provides that a grant of caretaking authority to a nonparent should generally be limited to the amount of time that the deploying parent previously exercised caretaking authority over the child, the court may vary this because of the
                        practicalities of travel relating to the temporary custody arrangement. For example, if a service member ordinarily visited the child on Sundays, the court's grant of this same custody schedule to the service member's parents would
                        be impracticable if the child needed to travel by bus or plane to visit the parents. In such a situation, the court might, for example, add the time for the child's travel to allow the grandparents a full day with the child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section also allows the court to grant some portion of the service member's authority to make important decisions for a child to a nonparent when a service member is deployed overseas and may not be available to make these decisions. Most states
                        presume that some day-to-day decision making authority automatically accompanies a court's grant of caretaking authority of a child. Section 306 allows the court to grant some of the decision making responsibility ordinarily considered
                        to be part of legal custody, including the ability to enroll the child in a local school, to direct religious training, deal with health care, to enroll the child in extracurricular activities, and to authorize the child to travel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because Article 3 allows the court to grant to a nonparent only authority that a service member already possesses, the court may not grant decision-making authority where the service member has no legal custody rights. Furthermore, Section 306 contemplates
                        that the court ordinarily will not grant all the decision-making authority that generally accompanies legal custody, such as the authority to give a minor permission to marry, or choosing the child's religion. Because these decisions
                        are generally not time-sensitive, it is expected that they will generally remain with the parent who permanently holds custody, even during deployment.

                    <p>
                        Because allowing the child contact with a person close to the deploying parent is a means through which the service member can seek to ensure a continuing bond with the child, the UDPCVA sets out a rebuttable presumption that such limited contact is in
                        the best interest of the child. As discussed in the Comment to Section 306 [G.S. 50A-374], the requirement that a grand of limited contact be "in accordance with law of this state other than this [act]" would incorporate any relevant
                        state or federal constitutional law, as well as other state law relating to custody determinations.

                        limited contact with a nonparent, the trial court was not bound by the schedule of custodial time granted to the father in the consent order, and the actual schedule and amount of limited contact with a nonparent remained within
                        the discretion of the trial court. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting limited contact to the eldest child on a different and lesser schedule than the father's usual custodial time under her consent order.

                        Section 310 [G.S. 50A-378] recognizes that a change of custody during deployment will in many instances require adjustment in child support, as a service member who normally is a custodial parent now will appropriately pay support to the other parent
                        or a nonparent with custody of the child. Accordingly, this section provides that a court determining caretaking authority during deployment may also enter a temporary order for child support if, based on underlying state law,
                        it would have jurisdiction to enter such an order.

                        Section 311 [G.S. 50A-379] provides that a court may modify temporary orders and agreements concerning custodial responsibility during deployment if it is in the best interest of the child. This standard is easier to meet than the standards for modifying
                        custody generally used in most states in that it does not require that the court find a substantial or material change of facts before modifying custody.

                        The UDPCVA makes termination of limited contact on a motion from the deploying parent mandatory by the court, rather than directs the court to conduct an inquiry concerning the child's best interests. The UDPCVA takes the position that because limited
                        contact is intended to further the deploying parent's relationship with the child, it should be solely within the deploying parent's discretion to terminate this contact.

                        Article 4 sets out procedures governing the termination of the temporary custody arrangement following the service member's return from deployment. In doing so, the UDPCVA seeks to balance the service member's interest in quickly and easily reestablishing
                        custody against the possibility that resumption of custody may no longer be in the child's best interest because of changes in the child's or service member's situation. Concerns about the child's best interest resulted in rejection
                        in the UDPCVA of an immediate, automatic reversion to the previous custody order following the service member's return. Instead, the Act provides for automatic reversion after [60] days in the absence of an agreement among the
                        parents; the purpose of the time lag is to enable the other parent to contest reversion of custody under other state law if that parent believes it is not in the best interest of the child.

                        The Article sets out three alternative procedures for termination of the temporary custody arrangement. Section 401 [G.S. 50A-385] sets out a procedure for terminating a temporary custody arrangement established by an agreement. Section 402 [G.S. 50A-386]
                        sets out a consent procedure for terminating a temporary custody arrangement established by court order. When no agreement to terminate a temporary custody order is reached between the parents, Section 404 [G.S. 50A-388] provides
                        for automatic termination of the custody order in [60] days.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    After a deploying parent returns from deployment and until a temporary agreement or order for custodial responsibility established under Part 2 or Part 3 of this Article is terminated, the court shall enter a temporary order granting the deploying parent
                    reasonable contact with the child unless it is contrary to the best interest of the child. The court shall enter a temporary order granting contact under this section even if the time exceeds the time the deploying parent spent with
                    the child before deployment.
