       § 17E-1. Findings and policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the office of sheriff, the office of deputy sheriff and the other officers and employees of the sheriff of a county are unique among all of the law-enforcement offices of North Carolina. The administration of criminal justice has been declared by Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes to be of statewide concern to the people of the State. The sheriff is the only officer of local government required by the Constitution. The sheriff, in addition to his criminal justice responsibilities, is the only officer who is also responsible for the courts of the State, and acting as their bailiff and marshall. The sheriff administers and executes criminal and civil justice and acts as the ex officio detention officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The deputy sheriff has been held by the Supreme Court of this State to hold an office of special trust and confidence, acting in the name of and with powers coterminous with his principal, the elected sheriff.
     </p>
     <p>
      The offices of sheriff and deputy sheriff are therefore of special concern to the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the people of the State. The training and educational needs of such officers therefore require particularized and differential treatment from those of the criminal justice officers certified under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Sheriff's Department is Local Governmental Entity.
   
   - In the injured party's suit against a sheriff and individual detention officers arising out of a five-day episode in the county detention center where she alleged that they ignored her requests for medical treatment, the trial court properly concluded that the office of North Carolina sheriff was a "person" under 42 U.S.C.S.
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1983 because: (1) the state constitution created the office of sheriff, N.C. Const. art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   2, but included that provision within the article governing local governments, along with provisions for counties, cities, towns, and other governmental subdivisions, N.C. Const. art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1; (2) state statutes, including <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17Ea01s17E-1" target="_self">G.S. 17E-1</a></cite>, 160A-288.2, 143-166.50, and 97-2, characterized a sheriff's department as a local governmental entity; (3) there was no contention that the State would be potentially liable for any monetary judgment entered against the sheriff and the detention officers; and (4) the State did not have, with respect to a sheriff, the minimum degree of control required for Eleventh Amendment immunity. Boyd v. Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 621 S.E.2d 1 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 629</cite>, 615 S.E.2d 866 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Deputy Sheriffs.
   
   - In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Termination for Political Reasons.
       </b>
       - In North Carolina, deputy sheriffs may be lawfully terminated for political reasons; the office of deputy sheriff is that of policy maker, and the deputy sheriff is an alter ego of the sheriff generally. Jenkins v. Medford, 119 F.3d 1156 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1090, 118 S. Ct. 881, 139 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure that the sheriff's policies are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

All justice officers who are exempted from the required entry level standards by this subsection are subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section as well as the requirements of G.S. 17E-4(a) in order to retain certification.
      </li>
      <li id="t17Ea02s17E-7ol1b">
       The Commission shall provide, by regulation, that no person may be appointed as a justice officer at entry level, except on a temporary or probationary basis, unless such person has satisfactorily completed an initial preparatory program of training at a school certified by the Commission or has been exempted from that requirement by the Commission pursuant to this Chapter. Upon separation of a justice officer from a sheriff's department within the temporary or probationary period of appointment, the probationary certification shall be terminated by the Commission. Upon the reappointment to the same department or appointment to another department of an officer who has separated from a department within the probationary period, the officer shall be charged with the amount of time served during his initial appointment and allowed the remainder of the probationary period to complete the basic training requirement. Upon the reappointment to the same department or appointment to another department of an officer who has separated from a department within the probationary period and who has remained out of service for more than one year from the date of separation, the officer shall be allowed another probationary period to complete such training as the Commission shall require by rule for an officer returning to service.
      </li>
      <li id="t17Ea02s17E-7ol1c">
       In addition to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission, by rules and regulations, may fix other qualifications for the employment and retention of justice officers including minimum age, education, physical and mental standards, citizenship, good moral character, experience, and such other matters as relate to the competence and reliability of persons to assume and discharge the responsibilities of the office. The Commission shall prescribe the means for presenting evidence of fulfillment of these requirements. The Commission shall require the administration of a psychological screening examination, including a face-to-face, in-person interview conducted by a licensed psychologist, to determine the justice officer's psychological suitability to properly fulfill the responsibilities of the justice officer. If face-to-face, in-person is not practicable, the face-to-face evaluation can be virtual as long as both the audio and video allow for a professional clinical evaluation in a clinical environment. The psychological screening examination shall be given (i) prior to the initial certification or (ii) prior to the criminal justice officer performing any action requiring certification by the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t17Ea02s17E-7ol1-c1">
       Any justice officer appointed as a telecommunicator at the entry level after March 1, 1998, shall meet all requirements of this Chapter. Any person employed in the capacity of a telecommunicator as defined by the Commission on or before March 1, 1998, shall not be required to meet any entry-level requirements as a condition of continued employment but shall be reported to the Commission for certification. All justice officers who are exempted from the required entry-level standards by this subsection are subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section as well as the requirements of G.S. 17E-4(a) in order to retain certification.
      </li>
      <li id="t17Ea02s17E-7ol1-c2">
       Effective July 1, 2022, any person employed as a telecommunicator by a municipal police agency shall meet all the requirements for telecommunicators as set forth in this Chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t17Ea02s17E-7ol1d">
       The Commission may issue a certificate evidencing satisfaction of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (c1) of this section to any applicant who presents such evidence as may be required by its rules and regulations of satisfactory completion of a program or course of instruction in another jurisdiction.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Where minimum educational standards are not met, yet the individual shows potential and a willingness to achieve the standards by extra study, they may be waived by the Commission for the reasonable amount of time it will take to achieve the standards required. Upon petition from a sheriff, the Commission may grant a waiver of any provisions of this section (17E-7) for any justice officer serving that sheriff.

A person required to report to the Division under subsection (a) of this section shall make the same report to the person's agency head within 30 days of being notified that the person may not be called to testify at trial. An agency head who receives a report that a person in the agency has been notified that they may not be called to testify at trial shall also report the notification to the Division in writing within 30 days of the agency head's receipt of that report.

The report shall include information for each case on whether a final agency decision has been entered pursuant to Chapter 150B of the General Statutes and what action, if any, has been taken against each certification. The report shall not include the name or any other identifying information of any person required to report pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

       Any person who has received a notification that may meet the reporting requirement provided in subsection (a) of this section may apply for a hearing in superior court for a judicial determination of whether or not the person received a notification that the person may not be called to testify at trial based on bias, interest, or lack of credibility. This hearing is limited to reviewing whether (i) a person who is certified by the Commission or has received a conditional offer of employment, (ii) has been notified in writing by a superior court judge, district court judge, federal judge, district attorney, assistant district attorney, United States attorney, or assistant United States attorney; or notified in open court by a superior court judge, district court judge, or federal judge, and documented in a written order, and (iii) that notification states that the person may not be called to testify at trial based on bias, interest, or lack of credibility, not matters of law or admissibility. The person must provide notice of the hearing to the Division. One extension of 15 days will be added to the 30-day reporting requirement provided in subsection (a) of this section if notice of a hearing is received.
