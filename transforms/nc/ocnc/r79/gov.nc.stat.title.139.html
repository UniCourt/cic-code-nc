     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t139a01s139-2ol1a">
       Legislative Determinations. - It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination:
       <ol>
        <li id="t139a01s139-2ol1a1">
         The Condition. - The farm, forest and grazing lands of the State of North Carolina are among the basic assets of the State and the preservation of these lands is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of its people; improper land-use practices have caused and have contributed to, and are now causing and contributing to, a progressively more serious erosion of the farm and grazing lands of this State by wind and water; the breaking of natural grass, plant, and forest cover has interfered with the natural factors of soil stabilization, causing loosening of soil and exhaustion of humus, and developing a soil condition that favors erosion; the topsoil is being blown and washed out of fields and pastures; there has been an accelerated washing of sloping fields; these processes of erosion by wind and water speed up with removal of absorptive topsoil, causing exposure of less absorptive and less protective but more erosive subsoil; failure by any land occupier to conserve the soil and control erosion upon his lands causes a washing and blowing of soil and water from his lands onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and control of erosion on such other lands difficult or impossible.
        </li>
        <li id="t139a01s139-2ol1a2">
         The Consequences. - The consequences of such soil erosion in the form of soil-blowing and soil-washing are the silting and sedimentation of stream channels, reservoirs, dams, ditches, and harbors; the loss of fertile soil material in dust storms; the piling up of soil on lower slopes, and its deposit over alluvial plains; the reduction in productivity or outright ruin of rich bottomlands by overwash of poor subsoil material, sand, and gravel swept out of the hills; deterioration of soil and its fertility, deterioration of crops grown thereon, and declining acre yields despite development of scientific processes for increasing such yields; loss of soil and water which causes destruction of food and cover for wildlife; a blowing and washing of soil into streams which silts over spawning beds, and destroys water plants, diminishing the food supply of fish; a diminishing of the underground water reserve, which causes water shortages, intensifies periods of drought, and causes crop failures; an increase in the speed and volume of rainfall runoff, causing severe and increasing floods, which bring suffering, disease, and death; impoverishment of families attempting to farm eroding and eroded lands; damage to roads, highways, railways, farm buildings, and other property from floods and from dust storms; and losses in navigation, hydroelectric power, municipal water supply, drainage developments, farming, and grazing.
        </li>
        <li id="t139a01s139-2ol1a3">
         The Appropriate Corrective Methods. - To conserve soil resources and control and prevent soil erosion and prevent floodwater and sediment damages, and further the conservation, utilization, and disposal of water, and the development of water resources it is necessary that land-use practices contributing to soil wastage and soil erosion be discouraged and discontinued, and appropriate soil-conserving land-use practices and works of improvement for flood prevention or the conservation, utilization, and disposal of water and the development of water resources be adopted and carried out. Among the procedures necessary for widespread adoption, are the carrying on of engineering operations such as the construction of terraces, terrace outlets, check-dams, desilting basins, floodwater retarding structures, channel improvements, floodways, dikes, ponds, ditches, and the like; the utilization of strip cropping, lister furrowing, contour cultivating, contour furrowing, farm drainage, land irrigation; seeding and planting of waste, sloping, abandoned, or eroded lands with water-conserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses; forestation and reforestation; rotation of crops; soil stabilization with trees, grasses, legumes, and other thick-growing, soil-holding crops; the addition of soil amendments, manurial materials, and fertilizers for the correction of soil deficiencies and to promote increased growth of soil-protecting crops; retardation of runoff by increasing absorption of rainfall; and retirement from cultivation of steep, highly erosive areas and areas now badly gullied or otherwise eroded.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t139a01s139-2ol1b">
       Declaration of Policy. - It is hereby declared to be the policy of the legislature to provide for the conservation of the soil and soil resources of this State, and for the control and prevention of soil erosion, and for the prevention of floodwater and sediment damages, and for furthering the conservation, utilization, and disposal of water, and the development of water resources and thereby to preserve natural resources, control floods, prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, assist in maintaining the navigability of rivers and harbors, preserve wildlife, protect the tax base, protect public lands, and protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the people of this State.

      - Session Laws 2001-355, ss. 1 to 6, as amended by Session Laws 2013-413, s. 57(y), provide for the implementation of the Tar-Pamlico River Basin-Nutrient Sensitive Waters Management Strategy: Agricultural Nutrient Control Strategy, as adopted by the Environmental Management Commission on 12 October 2000 and approved by the Rules Review Commission on 20 November 2000, to become effective on 1 September 2001. A Local Advisory Committee is to be appointed in each county or watershed, as specified in the Basin Oversight Committee, within the Tar-Pamlico River Basin; these committees terminate upon a finding by the Environmental Management Commission that the long-term maintenance of nutrient loads is assured. Under the act, the Soil and Water Commission is to approve best management practices for pasture-based production or management of livestock, including a point system applicable thereto. Harvesting of trees is also addressed. Furthermore, the Basin Oversight Committee is to develop a nutrient loading accounting methodology, to be approved by the Environmental Management Commission no later than 1 March 2003. The Environmental Management Commission may adopt and revise a temporary rule incorporating the provisions of the act until a permanent rule can be adopted. Session Laws 2001-355, s. 7, provides that ss. 2 and 3 of the act expire when the temporary rule becomes effective, and s. 4 expires upon a finding that the long-term maintenance of nutrient loads in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin is assured. Session Laws 2017-10, s. 3.9, repealed Session Laws 2001-355, s. 4, effective May 4, 2017.

The application shall be accompanied by a statement by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission, which shall certify (and such statement need contain no detail other than the mere recitals) that a petition was filed, notice issued, and hearing held as aforesaid, that the Commission did duly determine that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, for a soil and water conservation district to function in the proposed territory and did define the boundaries thereof; that notice was given and a referendum held on the question of the creation of such district, and that the result of such referendum showed a majority of the votes cast in such referendum to be in favor of the creation of the district; that thereafter the Commission did duly determine that the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable and feasible. The said statement shall set forth the boundaries of the district as they have been defined by the Commission.

      The Secretary of State shall examine the application and statement and, if he finds that the name proposed for the district is not identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this State or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion or uncertainty, he shall receive and file them and shall record them in an appropriate book of record in his office. If the Secretary of State shall find that the name proposed for the district is identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this State, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall certify such fact to the Soil and Water Conservation Commission, which shall thereupon submit to the Secretary of State a new name for the said district, which shall not be subject to such defects. Upon receipt of such new name, free of such defects, the Secretary of State shall record the application and statement, with the name so modified, in an appropriate book of record in his office. When the application and statement have been made, filed and recorded, as herein provided, the district shall constitute a governmental subdivision of this State and a public body corporate and politic. The Secretary of State shall make and issue to the said supervisors a certificate, under the seal of the State, of the due organization of the said district, and shall record such certificate with the application and statement. The boundaries of such district shall include the territory as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission as aforesaid, but in no event shall they include any area included within the boundaries of another soil and water conservation district organized under the provisions of this Chapter.

     <p>
      The governing body of a soil and water conservation district shall consist of the three elective supervisors from the county or counties in the district, together with the appointive members appointed by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission pursuant to this section, and shall be known as the district board of supervisors. When a district is composed of less than four counties, the board of supervisors of each county shall on or before October 31, 1978, and on or before October 31 as the terms of the appointive supervisors expire, recommend in writing two persons from the district to the Commission to be appointed to serve with the elective supervisors. If the names are not submitted to the Commission as required, the office shall be deemed vacant on the date the term is set to expire and the Commission shall appoint two persons of the district to the district board of supervisors to serve with the elected supervisors. The Commission shall make its appointments prior to or at the November meeting of the Commission. Appointive supervisors shall take office on the first Monday in December following their appointment. Such appointive supervisors shall serve for a term of four years, and thereafter, as their terms expire, their successors shall serve for a term of four years. The terms of office of all appointive supervisors who have heretofore been lawfully appointed for terms the final year of which presently extends beyond the first Monday in December are hereby terminated on the first Monday in December of the final year of appointment. Vacancies for any reason in the appointive supervisors shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointment of a person by the Commission from the district in which the vacancy occurs. Vacancies for any reason in the elected supervisors shall be filled for the unexpired term by appointment by the Commission of a person from the county in the district in which the vacancy occurs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In those districts composed of four or more counties, the Commission may, but is not required to, appoint two persons from the district without recommendation from the board of supervisors, to serve as district supervisors along with the elected members of the board of supervisors. Such appointments shall be made at the same time other appointments are made under this section, and the persons appointed shall serve for a term of four years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervisors shall designate a chairman and may, from time to time, change such designation. A simple majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting the business of the board, and approval by a majority of those present shall be adequate for a determination of any matter before the board, provided at least a quorum is present. Supervisors of soil and water conservation districts shall be compensated for their services at the per diem rate and allowed travel, subsistence and other expenses, as provided for State boards, commissions and committees generally, under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138.html#t138s138-5" target="_blank">G.S. 138-5</a></cite>; provided, that when per diem compensation and travel, subsistence, or other expense is claimed by any supervisor for services performed outside the district for which such supervisor ordinarily may be appointed or elected to serve, the same may not be paid unless prior written approval is obtained from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervisors may employ a secretary, technical experts, whose qualifications shall be approved by the Department, and such other employees as they may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. The supervisors may call upon the Attorney General of the State for such legal services as they may require. The supervisors may delegate to their chairman, to one or more supervisors, or to one or more agents, or employees such powers and duties as they may deem proper. The supervisors shall furnish to the Soil and Water Conservation Commission, upon request, copies of such ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, contracts, forms, and other documents as they shall adopt or employ, and such other information concerning their activities as it may require in the performance of its duties under this Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervisors shall provide for the execution of surety bonds for all employees and officers who shall be entrusted with funds or property; shall provide for the keeping of a full and accurate record of all proceedings and of all resolutions, regulations, and orders issued or adopted; and shall provide for an annual audit of the accounts of receipts and disbursements. In any given year, if the supervisors provide for an internal audit, and the supervisor serving as chairman certifies, under oath, that this internal audit is a true and accurate reflection of the accounts of receipts and disbursements, then the supervisors shall not be required, notwithstanding the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html#t159sIIIa03s159-34" target="_blank">G.S. 159-34</a></cite>, to provide for an audit of the accounts of receipts and disbursements by a certified public accountant or by an accountant certified by the Local Government Commission. Any supervisor may be removed by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty, incompetence or malfeasance in office, but for no other reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervisors may invite the legislative body of any municipality or county located near the territory comprised within the district to designate a representative to advise and consult with the supervisors of the district on all questions of program and policy which may affect the property, water supply, or other interests of such municipality or county.

       Funding. - Any special revenue fund established under this section shall consist of funds received by appropriation from any other fund consistent with the limitations under G.S. 159-13(b); grant moneys; donations; direct appropriations from the State or any of its agencies or political subdivisions; or any other unrestricted funds appropriated to a soil and water conservation district from any source. When the conservation easement maintenance fund receives moneys or investment securities, the use of which is restricted by law, the identity of such moneys or investment securities shall be maintained by appropriate accounting entries.
      </li>
      <li id="t139a01s139-7.1ol1d">

No withdrawal may be authorized unless it is for a purpose that is specified in the resolution or ordinance under subsection (a) of this section or in a resolution or ordinance under subsection (b) of this section. The resolution or ordinance to authorize a withdrawal under this subsection shall authorize an appropriation from the special revenue fund to one of the funds maintained pursuant to G.S. 159-13(a); however, no withdrawal may be authorized that would result in an appropriation for conservation easement maintenance purposes for which an adequate balance of eligible moneys or investment securities is not available in the special revenue fund at the time the resolution or ordinance under this subsection is adopted.

     <p>
      The supervisors of any district shall have authority to formulate regulations governing the use of lands within the district in the interest of conserving the soil and soil resources and preventing and controlling soil erosion. The supervisors may conduct such public meetings and public hearings upon tentative regulations as may be necessary to assist them in this work. The supervisors shall not have authority to enact such land-use regulations into law until after they shall have caused due notice to be given of their intention to conduct a referendum for submission of such regulations to the occupiers of lands lying within the boundaries of the district for their indication of approval or disapproval of such proposed regulations, and until after the supervisors have considered the result of such referendum. The proposed regulations shall be embodied in a proposed ordinance. Copies of such proposed ordinance shall be available for the inspection of all eligible voters during the period between publication of such notice and the date of the referendum. The notices of the referendum shall recite the contents of such proposed ordinance, or shall state where copies of such proposed ordinance may be examined. The question shall be submitted by ballots, upon which the words "For approval of proposed ordinance number ____________, prescribing land-use regulations for conservation of soil and prevention of erosion" and "Against approval of proposed ordinance number ____________, prescribing land-use regulations for conservation of soil and prevention of erosion" shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose approval of such proposed ordinance. The supervisors shall supervise such referendum, shall prescribe appropriate regulations, governing the conduct thereof, and shall publish the result thereof. All occupiers of lands within the district shall be eligible to vote in such referendum. Only such land occupiers shall be eligible to vote. No informalities in the conduct of such referendum or in any matters relating thereto shall invalidate said referendum or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given substantially as herein provided and said referendum shall have been fairly conducted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The supervisors shall not have authority to enact such proposed ordinance into law unless at least two thirds of the votes cast in such referendum shall have been cast for approval of the said proposed ordinance. The approval of the proposed ordinance by a two thirds of the votes cast in such referendum shall not be deemed to require the supervisors to enact such proposed ordinance into law.

     </ol>
     <p>
      The regulations shall be uniform, throughout the territory comprised within the district except that the supervisors may classify the lands within the district with reference to such factors as soil type, degree of slope, degree of erosion threatened or existing, cropping and tillage practices in use, and other relevant factors, and may provide regulations varying with the type or class of land affected, but uniform as to all lands within each class or type.

     <p>
      Where the supervisors of any district shall find that any of the provisions of land-use regulations prescribed in an ordinance adopted in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 139-9 are not being observed on particular lands, and that such nonobservance tends to increase erosion on such lands and its interfering with the prevention of control of erosion on other lands within the district, the supervisors may present to the superior court for the county or counties within which the lands of the defendant lie a petition, duly verified, setting forth the adoption of the ordinance prescribing land-use regulations, the failure of the defendant land occupier to observe such regulations, and to perform particular work, operations, or avoidances as required thereby, and that such nonobservance tends to increase erosion on such lands and is interfering with the prevention or control of erosion on other lands within the district, and praying the court to require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances within a reasonable time and to order that if the defendant shall fail so to perform, the supervisors may go on the land, perform the work or other operations or otherwise bring the condition of such lands into conformity with the requirements of such regulations, and recover the cost and expenses thereof, with interest, from the occupier of such land. Upon the presentation of such petition, the court shall cause process to be issued against the defendant, and shall hear the case. If it appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence, or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court may dismiss the petition, or it may require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances, and may provide that upon the failure of the defendant to initiate such performance within the time specified in the order of the court, and to prosecute the same to completion with reasonable diligence, the supervisors may enter upon the lands involved and perform the work or operations or otherwise bring the condition of such lands into conformity with the requirements of the regulations and recover the costs and expenses thereof, with interest at the rate of five per centum (5%) per annum, from the occupier of such lands.

      The court shall retain jurisdiction of the case until after the work has been completed.

The court shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment for the amount of such costs and expenses, with interest at the rate of five per centum (5%) per annum until paid, together with the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court. This judgment, when filed in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 1-234, shall constitute a lien upon such lands.

       § 139-13. Discontinuance of districts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time after five years after the organization of a district under the provisions of this Chapter, any 25 occupiers of land lying within the boundaries of such districts may file a petition with the Soil and Water Conservation Commission praying that the operations of the district be terminated and the existence of the district discontinued. The Commission may conduct such public meetings and public hearings upon such petition as may be necessary to assist it in the consideration thereof. Within 60 days after such a petition has been received by the Commission it shall give due notice of the holding of a referendum, and shall supervise such referendum, and issue appropriate regulations governing the conduct thereof, the question to be submitted by ballots upon which the words "For terminating the existence of the ______________ (name of the soil and water conservation district to be here inserted)" and "Against terminating the existence of the ______________
   (name of the soil and water conservation district to be here inserted)" shall appear with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose discontinuance of such district. All occupiers of lands lying within the boundaries of the district shall be eligible to vote in such referendum. Only such land occupiers shall be eligible to vote. No informalities in the conduct of such referendum or in any matters relating thereto shall invalidate said referendum or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given substantially as herein provided and said referendum shall have been fairly conducted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall publish the result of such referendum and shall thereafter consider and determine whether the continued operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible. If the Commission shall determine that the continued operation of such district is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and deny the petition. If the Commission shall determine that the continued operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and shall certify such determination to the supervisors of the district. In making such determination the Commission shall give due regard and weight to the attitudes of the occupiers of lands lying within the district, the number of land occupiers eligible to vote in such referendum who shall have voted, the proportion of the votes cast in such referendum in favor of the discontinuance of the district to the total number of votes cast, the approximate wealth and income of the land occupiers of the district, the probable expense of carrying on erosion control operations within such district, and such other economic and social factors as may be relevant to such determination, having due regard to the legislative findings set forth in G.S. 139-2: Provided, however, that the Commission shall not have authority to determine that the continued operation of the district is administratively practicable and feasible unless at least a majority of the votes cast in the referendum shall have been cast in favor of the continuance of such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt from the Soil and Water Conservation Commission of a certification that the Commission has determined that the continued operation of the district is not administratively practicable and feasible, pursuant to the provisions of this section, the supervisors shall forthwith proceed to terminate the affairs of the district. The supervisors shall dispose of all property belonging to the district at public auction and shall pay over the proceeds of such sale to be covered into the State treasury. The supervisors shall thereupon file an application, duly verified, with the Secretary of State for the discontinuance of such district, and shall transmit with such application the certificates of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission setting forth the determination of the Commission that the continued operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible. The application shall recite that the property of the district has been disposed of and the proceeds paid over as in this section provided, and shall set forth a full accounting of such properties and proceeds of the sale. The Secretary of State shall issue to the supervisors a certificate of dissolution and shall record such certificate in an appropriate book of record in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon issuance of a certificate of dissolution under the provisions of this section, all ordinances and regulations theretofore adopted and in force within such districts shall be of no further force and effect. All contracts theretofore entered into, to which the district or supervisors are parties, shall remain in force and effect for the period provided in such contracts. The Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall be substituted for the district or supervisors as party to such contracts. The Commission shall be entitled to all benefits and subject to all liabilities under such contracts and shall have the same right and liability to perform, to require performance, to sue and be sued thereon, and to modify or terminate such contracts by mutual consent or otherwise as the supervisors of the district would have had. Such dissolution shall not affect the lien of any judgment entered under the provisions of G.S. 139-11, nor the pendency of any action instituted under the provisions of such section, and the Commission shall succeed to all the rights and obligations of the district or supervisors as to such liens and actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall not entertain petitions for the discontinuance of any district nor conduct referenda upon such petitions, nor make determinations pursuant to such petitions, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, more often than once in five years.

     <p>
      Whenever the Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall receive a petition from any board of district supervisors signed by all supervisors of such district, the Commission shall have the authority to divide such district into two or more districts. The governing bodies of the resulting districts shall be composed of supervisors in the same manner and in the same number as is provided in G.S. 139-6 and 139-7. Upon the creating of new districts through dividing an existing district under the provisions of this section, the Commission shall appoint all district supervisors necessary to give such district its full quota of supervisors who shall serve until regular supervisors are elected or appointed, as the case may be, at the time of the next regular election of supervisors. The Commission shall assign a name to each district resulting from the division of the district under the provisions of this section and do all other things necessary to complete the organization of such new districts and place them on an operating basis.

       Local watershed sponsors may install and maintain recreational facilities and services in connection with watershed improvement works or projects, and may provide areas (including structures) for the conservation and replacement of fish and wildlife habitat. For any of these purposes said sponsors may appropriate and expend funds, may levy taxes and assessments, and may issue bonds and notes, to the same extent as in the case of other authorized watershed activities. Such recreational facilities and services may include but are not limited to any or all of the water-related recreational facilities provided for in subsection (b) of this section, and parking areas, ingress and egress roads, hiking or nature trails, picnic areas and campsites. No application for watershed planning under Public Law 566 (83rd Congress, United States), as amended, may be approved by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission until after receipt and consideration of recommendations from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency concerning replacement of fish and wildlife habitat in mitigation of anticipated damages: Provided that this requirement for consideration of fish and wildlife recommendations shall not apply if such recommendations are not received by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission within 30 days after the Soil and Water Conservation Commission requests such recommendations.
