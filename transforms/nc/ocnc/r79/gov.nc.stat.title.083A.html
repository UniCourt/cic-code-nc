    A single act of unauthorized practice is sufficient,
   
   if shown, to invoke the criminal penalties of this section or the injunctive relief of former G.S. 150-31. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Buildings for Himself.
   
   - The words "buildings for himself " contained in the express statutory exception are broad and comprehensive, and contain no limitation of any kind. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   </p>
   <p>
    The statutory exception, "buildings for himself," contemplates possession by the designer of the building for whatever lawful purpose he may choose. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   </p>
   <p>
    If the General Assembly had intended the statutory exception, "buildings for himself," to be limited to buildings actually occupied by the designer, and not for lease and use by the public, it could quite easily have said so. The General Assembly in its wisdom and discretion did not so limit the statutory exception. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   </p>
   <p>
    The express statutory exception, pertaining to plans for a person's own building, contains no provision preventing defendant from selling an interest in the building for which he made the plans. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Included Building on Property Held as Tenants by the Entirety.
   
   - Taking into consideration that during the existence of the tenancy by the entirety the husband has the absolute and exclusive right to the control, use, possession, rents, income, and profits of the lands held by him and his wife as tenants by the entirety, when defendant made plans for the construction of an automobile sales and service building upon lands composed of several tracts, title to some of the component tracts being in him, and some in him and his wife as tenants by the entirety, it seems clear that he was making plans for a building for himself within the meaning of the specific exception contained in this section. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    But Not a Church of Which Defendant Was a Member.
   
   - Where defendant was a member of the church and title to the land upon which the educational building was constructed was held by five trustees of whom he was one, and he executed the mortgage to finance the construction of the educational building, the judge's findings of fact clearly showed that defendant made the "plans" for the building for Salem Baptist Church, and not for himself. North Carolina Bd. of Arch. v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 602</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 643 (1965).

   <p>
    Right of Unregistered Person to Recover for Work on Plans.
   
   - Plaintiff, a builder-designer, but not a licensed architect, who made preliminary studies, consulted with defendants and made changes on plans calling for the construction of a residence originally intended to cost about $18,000, could recover on a quantum meruit basis for the work he performed on the plans up to the time the residence designed did not exceed in value $20,000, but he was not entitled to recover for any work performed after the plans called for a residence of a value in excess of $20,000.
