                            Legislative Intent. - In enacting this Chapter, the legislature did not intend to authorize the recovery of amounts paid unlicensed contractors after the buildings in question had already been built, even though the contract would be unenforceable and
                            illegal. Hawkins v. Holland, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 388 S.E.2d 221 (1990).

                            The importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the construction business outweighs any harshness between the parties and precludes consideration for unjust enrichment. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson,

                            Applicability of this Article is determined by the cost of the undertaking and not by the amount of any separate progress payment required by the contract. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                            12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                        <p>
                            A contractor is a general contractor if the cost of the undertaking exceeds the statutory limit. The cost of the undertaking is determinative. Fulton v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 669, 184 S.E.2d 421 (1971);
                            Phillips v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 296 S.E.2d 317 (1982), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 694</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 387 (1983).

                        <p>
                            The cost of a building, which is usually the contract price, as opposed to the total completed cost, determines whether the $30,000 limit of this section has been violated and thus whether the contractor must be licensed. Revis Sand &amp; Stone, Inc.
                            v. King, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 270 S.E.2d 580 (1980).

                            A contractor engages in construction when he undertakes to build an entire building or improve an already existing building. Reliable Properties, Inc. v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 783, 336 S.E.2d
                            108 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 379</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 897 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Cost of Undertaking Is Contract Price. - In determining whether a contractor who undertakes to build a house is a "general contractor" the term "cost of undertaking" is construed as the contractor's contract price, not the total cost of the building.
                            Fulton v. Rice, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 669, 184 S.E.2d 421 (1971); Revis Sand &amp; Stone, Inc. v. King, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 270 S.E.2d 580 (1980).

                        <p>
                            It is the cost of the undertaking by the purported contractor that controls. The contract price, or cost of the contractor's undertaking is not always the same as the total cost of the building. The owner's total cost of the building is not determinative
                            of the contractor's status. Hickory Furn. Mart, Inc. v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 230 S.E.2d 609 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Cost of Undertaking Where Contractor Controls Purchases. - Builder, although not licensed as a general contractor, met the threshold criteria of this section, in that he exercised a substantial degree of control by his supervision of construction, his
                            purchase of material, and his selection of material suppliers. And where his purchase of materials alone totalled over $29,000.00, and the fee for his services and supervision was $16,785.57, the threshold amount of $30,000
                            was well exceeded. Spears v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 330 S.E.2d 38 (1985), upholding summary judgment in defendants' favor on grounds that plaintiff was barred from
                            recovery as a matter of law.

                        <p>
                            Common-law definition of a general contractor is irrelevant in deciding the question of whether a license is required. Florence Concrete Prods., Inc. v. North Carolina Licensing Bd., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite>                            270, 437 S.E.2d 877 (1994), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 134</cite>, 459 S.E.2d 201 (1995).

                            Control Is Principal Distinguishing Characteristic Between Contractor and Subcontractor. - Where one contracts with a landowner to undertake the construction of a house for the landowner at an agreed price of $30,000 or more, he is a "general contractor"
                            and subject to the provisions of the licensing statute. Hickory Furn. Mart, Inc. v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 230 S.E.2d 609 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Principal characteristic of a general contractor, as opposed to a subcontractor or mere employee, is the degree of control to be exercised by the contractor over the construction of the entire project. Roberts v. Heffner,
                            <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 277 S.E.2d 446 (1981).

                        <p>
                            The general contractor may be distinguished from a subcontractor or employee by the degree of control that he or she exercises over the entire project. Phillips v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 296
                            S.E.2d 317 (1982), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 694</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 387 (1983).

                        <p>
                            The principal characteristic distinguishing a general contractor from subcontractor or other party contracting with the owner with respect to a portion of the project, or a mere employee, is the degree of control to be exercised by the contractor over
                            the construction of the entire project. Mill-Power Supply Co. v. CVM Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 355 S.E.2d 245 (1987).

                            Genuine Issue of Material Fact as to Degree of Control. - Although plaintiff constructed an improvement under this section, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether, following the "control test," plaintiff exercised such a degree of control
                            over the entire renovation project as to make plaintiff a general contractor under this section, requiring plaintiff to be licensed in order to bring an action for breach of contract. Mill-Power Supply Co. v. CVM Assocs.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 355 S.E.2d 245 (1987).

                            Contractor Must Be Licensed at Time of Contracting and During Construction. - This Article clearly contemplates that a contractor should be licensed at the time of contracting and during the construction period. Barrett, Robert &amp; Woods, Inc. v. Armi,
                            <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 134, 296 S.E.2d 10, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 269</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 214 (1982).

                            License May Be Used to Reveal Who Is Liable for Negligence. - Substantial evidence supported the allegation, in plaintiffs' negligence suit, that the defendant was the general contractor for the construction of their house where both the company owner
                            and the company manager testified that defendant's general contractor's license was used to build the house although other evidence showed that he was never present but that they did all the work. Allen v. Roberts Constr. Co.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 532 S.E.2d 534 (2000).

                            Building for Another on Builder's Land. - In an action seeking specific performance or money damages under a building contract, the trial court's conclusions that the defendants were unlicensed general contractors who had contracted to construct a dwelling
                            for plaintiffs for a price in excess of $30,000 supported its judgment that defendants were barred from affirmatively asserting their claims under the contract, and there was no merit to defendants' contention that they should
                            not be so barred because they contracted to build the dwelling on their own property, since a builder, who is unable or unwilling to obtain a general contractor's license from the State of North Carolina, should not be allowed
                            to thwart the plain intent of this section by the artifice of contracting to build a residence for another on the builder's land. Roberts v. Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 646,

                            Grading. - Construed in the context of the language of this section and G.S. 87-10, the word "grading" connotes an activity which is a part of, or preparatory for, work properly termed "building and construction." C.C. Walker Grading &amp; Hauling, Inc.

                            "Building" and "Structure". - The words "building" and "structure" in this section are synonymous. They agree in meaning but differ slightly in application. "Structure" retains more frequently than the other the sense of something constructed, often in
                            a particular way. Vogel v. Reed Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 119</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 273 (1970).

                        <p>
                            The words "building" and "structure" are strictly construed in context with the remainder of this section, and they do not embrace parts or segments of a building or structure. They exclude any meaning the legislature could have conveyed simply by adding
                            the words "or any part thereof " following the word "structure." Vogel v. Reed Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 119</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 273 (1970).

                            A building is defined as "an edifice . . . a structure"; and a structure is defined as "that which is built or constructed; an edifice or building of any kind." Vogel v. Reed Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 119</cite>,

                            Customer May Not Waive Requirements of Statute. - The general contractors licensing statute does not authorize a person with whom an unlicensed contractor deals to waive the requirements of the statute, nor does it grant the unlicensed contractor immunity
                            merely because he advises the customer that he is acting in violation of the statute. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                            The licensing statutes should not be used as a shield to avoid a just obligation owed to an innocent party. The courts will not impose penalties for the failure to comply with licensing requirements in addition to those specifically set out in the statute.

                            Unregulated Parties to Illegal Contract May Enforce It. - Others not regulated by the licensing statutes passed for their protection do not act illegally in becoming parties to a contract illegally entered into by an unlicensed contractor. The policy
                            underlying the licensing statutes would not be served by preventing enforcement by those for whose protection the statutes were passed. These parties may enforce the contract against the unlicensed contractor. Brady v. Fulghum,

                            class of persons the Legislature intended to protect by the enactment of G.S. 87-1 et seq., and the enforcement of the contract would not result in any injury to the public. Voller Realty &amp; Constr., Ltd. v. D.V. Holdings,

                            or on the theory of quantum meruit. Mill-Power Supply Co. v. CVM Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 355 S.E.2d 245 (1987).

                            plaintiff was not a contractor licensed by the State of North Carolina, as required by this section, and the contract was, therefore, not valid. RCDI Constr. v. Spaceplanrchitecture, Planning &amp; Interiors, P.A., 148 F. Supp.

                            Denial of Recovery Effectuates Statutory Purpose. - Public policy considerations militate against permitting unlicensed general construction contractors to enforce their contracts. Denying the contractor the right to enforce his contract effectuates the

                            Unlicensed Person May Not Recover for Owner's Breach of Contract. - When, in disregard of this Article, an unlicensed person contracts with an owner to erect a building costing more than the minimum sum specified in this section, he may not recover for
                            the owner's breach of that contract. Bryan Bldrs. Supply v. Midyette, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 264</cite>, 162 S.E.2d 507 (1968); Vogel v. Reed Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 119</cite>,

                            When an unlicensed person contracts with an owner to erect a building costing more than the minimum sum specified in this section, he may not recover for the owner's breach of the contract, nor may he recover the value of the work and services furnished
                            under the contract on the theory of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                        <p>
                            To deny any unlicensed person the right to recover damages for breach of the contract, which it was unlawful for him to make, but to allow him to recover the value of work and services furnished under that contract would defeat the legislative purpose
                            of protecting the public from incompetent contractors. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The same rule which prevents an unlicensed person from recovering damages for the breach of a construction contract has generally been held also to deny recovery where the cause of action is based on quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. To deny an unlicensed
                            person the right to recover damages for breach of the contract, which it was unlawful for him to make, but to allow him to recover the value of work and services furnished under that contract would defeat the legislative purpose
                            of protecting the public from incompetent contractors. The importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the construction business outweighs any harshness between the parties and precludes consideration for unjust
                            enrichment. Revis Sand &amp; Stone, Inc. v. King, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 270 S.E.2d 580 (1980).

                        <p>
                            When, in disregard of this protective statute, an unlicensed person contracts with an owner to erect a building costing more than the minimum sum specified in the statute, he may not recover for the owner's breach of that contract. This is true even though
                            the statute does not expressly forbid such suits. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C.

                            An unlicensed person who, in disregard of this section, contracts with another to construct a building for the cost of $30,000 or more, may not affirmatively enforce the contract or recover for his services and materials supplied under the theory of quantum
                            meruit or unjust enrichment. Roberts v. Heffner, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 277 S.E.2d 446 (1981).

                            One who violates the licensing requirements for general contractors may not recover on the contract nor may he recover under theories of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. This policy, although a stringent one, has been considered imperative in light
                            of the statutory purpose of this section to protect the public by deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the construction business. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite>                            99, 302 S.E.2d 4, modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).

                        <p>
                            The general rule is that when an unlicensed person contracts with an owner to construct a building costing more than the minimum sum specified in the statute, he may not recover for the owner's breach of that contract. Coats v. Jones,
                            <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 303 S.E.2d 655, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 815</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 253 (1983).

                        <p>
                            Although the statute does not expressly preclude an unlicensed contractor's suit against an owner for breach of contract, the contractor may not recover on the contract or in quantum meruit when he has ignored the protective statute. Brady v. Fulghum,

                            There can be no substantial compliance with the licensing statutes, where an unlicensed contractor has illegally entered into a contract. Neither may the contractor recover for extras, additions or changes made during construction commenced pursuant to
                            the contract. Such a contract is not, however, void. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).

                            Unlicensed contractor may not maintain a counterclaim arising out of a construction contract in the owner's action against the contractor and his wife to recover the balance due on a promissory note which does not relate to the construction contract between
                            the owners and the contractor. To allow an unlicensed contractor to maintain such a counterclaim would violate the public policy manifest in this section. Brock v.

                            Doctrine of Substantial Compliance Is Rejected. - In recognition of the essential illegality of an unlicensed contractor's entering into a construction contract for which a license is required and in order to give full effect to the legislative intent
                            to furnish protection to the public by strict licensing requirements, the Supreme Court of North Carolina rejects the doctrine of substantial compliance, cognizant that harsh consequences may sometimes fall on those who do
                            contracting work without a license. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).

                            Expiration of License During Construction. - If a licensed contractor's license expires, for whatever reason, during construction, he may recover for only the work performed while he was duly licensed. If, in that situation, the contractor renews his
                            license during construction, he may recover for work performed before expiration and after renewal. If, by virtue of these rules, harsh results fall upon unlicensed contractors who violate the statutes, the contractors themselves
                            bear both the responsibility and the blame. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).

                            Subsequent Procurement of License Does Not Validate Contract. - The existence of a license at the time the contract is signed is determinative and great weight is attached to the significant moment of the entrance of the parties into the relationship.
                            Accordingly, a contract illegally entered into by an unlicensed general construction contractor is unenforceable by the contractor. It cannot be validated by the contractor's subsequent procurement of a license. Brady v. Fulghum,

                            Trial court did not err in granting a corporation summary judgment in a limited liability company's (LLC) action alleging causes of action for breach of contract and quantum meruit because the LLC performed the work of a general contractor for which it

                            It would serve no public policy intended by this Chapter to hold a subcontractor to be a general contractor within the purview of this section. If the legislature had intended to include subcontractors in the class required to be licensed, it would have

                        Legislative Intent As to Validity of License. - It is apparent that the legislature wished to allow a window of time beyond the expiration date of 31 December in which a contractor in the midst of construction could hold, renew, and retain a legally efficacious
                        license with no legally recognizable hiatus in his status as "licensed contractor." Hall v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 779</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 816 (1991).

                        Distinction Between Expiration and Invalidity of License. - This section makes a purposeful distinction between a contractor whose license has expired and one whose license is invalid. The former is a statutory consequence: all contractors' licenses expire
                        on 31 December of each year. The latter is a consequence of contractor inaction: if no attempt to renew is made within 60 days of expiration, the license is invalid, without legal effect. Hall v. Simmons,
                        <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 779</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 816 (1991).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Purpose. - One of the obvious purposes of requiring annual renewal of licenses is to enable the Licensing Board to maintain and publish the roster of currently licensed contractors as required by G.S. 87-8. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section is to protect the public from incompetent builders by forbidding them to maintain an action on their contracts, thereby discouraging them from undertaking projects beyond their capabilities. Hickory Furn. Mart, Inc. v. Burns,
                        <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 230 S.E.2d 609 (1976).

                    <p>
                        By requiring this examination, the legislature seeks to guarantee skill, training and ability to accomplish such construction in a safe and workmanlike fashion. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d
                        327 (1983).

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section, the North Carolina licensing statute, is to guarantee skill, training and ability to accomplish construction in a safe and workmanlike fashion. Reliable Properties, Inc. v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite>                        783, 336 S.E.2d 108 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 379</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 897 (1986).

                        Allowing a contractor to offset any sums owed to a person by the amount equal to those services performed as an unlicensed contractor would run afoul of the clear statutory purpose to penalize contractors that fail to comply with the applicable licensing
                        procedures. 301 E. Seventh St. Ltd. Partnership v. Gellman Corp., 124 Bankr. 687 (W.D.N.C. 1991).

                    <p>
                        Annual license renewal should be considered an important, and not merely a perfunctory, requirement in order to accomplish the protective public purpose of the statute. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Nature and Purpose of Annual Renewal Fees. - The annual renewal fees required by this section are in no way related to the license taxes required to be paid by contractors by the North Carolina Revenue Act. The renewal fees required by this section are
                        not part of the State's revenues, but provide the funds by which the North Carolina State Licensing Board for Contractors is enabled to carry out the public purposes for which it was created. Therefore the payment of these fees
                        bears a direct and substantial relationship to the accomplishment of the public purposes of G.S. 87-1 et seq. Ar-Con Constr. Co. v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 12, 168 S.E.2d 18 (1969).

                    <p>
                        License Valid Through 60-Day Period for Purposes of Recovery Expenditures. - A contractor whose license expires during construction is "duly licensed" for purposes of recovering for materials purchased and work performed so long as his license is "valid."
                        The period of validity extends from initial licensing or renewal through the 60-day period following 31 December. A contractor may recover for expenditures for labor and materials made within that period of validity. Hall v. Simmons,
                        <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 779</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 816 (1991). But see 301 E. Seventh St. Ltd. Partnership v. Gellman Corp., 124 Bankr. 687 (W.D.N.C. 1991).

        No Recovery for Services Performed After License Expired.
       </b> - A license expires on the thirty-first day of December and a contractor is not entitled to any recovery for services performed following the expiration of the license. 301 E. Seventh St. Ltd. Partnership v. Gellman
                        Corp., 124 Bankr. 687 (W.D.N.C. 1991).

                    <p>
                        No Recovery for Expenditures Made During License's Invalidity. - When a contractor fails to renew his license within the 60-day period, his license is thenceforth invalid, and he may not recover for any expenditures made during its invalidity. Hall v.
                        Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 779</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 816 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Unlicensed Party May Not Maintain Action. - Where the party who acted as a general contractor was unlicensed not only at the time the contract was entered into but at all times thereafter while undertaking to perform under it, the unlicensed contractor
                        could not maintain his actions against the defendant. Holland v. Walden, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 181 S.E.2d 197, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 349</cite>, 182 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        An unlicensed contractor cannot affirmatively enforce his contract; neither can he recover in quantum meruit, because this would achieve the result forbidden at law. Hickory Furn. Mart, Inc. v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite>                        626, 230 S.E.2d 609 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An unlicensed general contractor may neither affirmatively enforce his contract nor recover in quantum meruit. Phillips v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 296 S.E.2d 317 (1982), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 694</cite>,

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One who violates the licensing requirements for general contractors may not recover on the contract nor may he recover under theories of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. This policy, although a stringent one, has been considered imperative in light
                        of the statutory purpose of G.S. 87-1 to protect the public by deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the construction business. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 99, 302
                        S.E.2d 4, modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where plaintiff engaged in renovation including the installation of new roofing, correction of dry rot, installation of new storm doors and windows, and the complete renovation of all apartment interiors, the renovation improved already existing buildings
                        and constituted construction within the meaning of G.S. 87-1. And as plaintiff undertook to "superintend or manage" this construction without complying with the licensing requirements of this section, plaintiff was not entitled
                        to recover from defendant on the contract or in quantum meruit. Reliable Properties, Inc. v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 783, 336 S.E.2d 108 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 379</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Construction company was barred from recovering on a contract to build a house on the property owners' property because the company did not have a valid general contractor's license at the time the contract was formed. Currin &amp; Currin Constr., Inc.
                        v. Lingerfelt, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 711, 582 S.E.2d 321 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Violation Of The Building Code Is Negligence Per Se. - Negligence per se was shown in a wrongful death case because (1) a licensed contractor was subject to the North Carolina Building Code, and (2) the evidence showed the contractor supplied a marina
                        where the decedent died in a fire with an unapproved fuel dispensing nozzle causing the decedent's death. Estate of Coppick v. Hobbs Marina Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 772
                        S.E.2d 1 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Supervision by Licensed Employee When Person Acting as General Contractor Is Unlicensed. - Where record showed that plaintiff, although he was not licensed, acted as a general contractor in contracting to build defendants' house at a cost exceeding $30,000,
                        the order refusing to enforce plaintiff's contract and dismissing its claim against defendants was properly entered, even though the construction contracted for was supervised by its employee, a licensed general contractor. Hanover
                        Realty, Inc. v. Flickinger, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 674, 362 S.E.2d 173 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Denial of Recovery Effectuates Statutory Purpose. - Public policy considerations militate against permitting unlicensed general construction contractors to enforce their contracts. Denying the contractor the right to enforce his contract effectuates the
                        statutory purpose and legislative intent of providing the public with optimum protection. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Doctrine of Substantial Compliance Rejected. - In recognition of the essential illegality of an unlicensed contractor's entering into a construction contract for which a license is required and in order to give full effect to the legislative intent to
                        furnish protection to the public by strict licensing requirements, the Supreme Court of North Carolina rejects the doctrine of substantial compliance, cognizant that harsh consequences may sometimes fall on those who do contracting
                        work without a license. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There can be no substantial compliance with the licensing statutes, where an unlicensed contractor has illegally entered into a contract. Neither may the contractor recover for extras, additions or changes made during construction commenced pursuant to
                        the contract. Such a contract is not, however, void. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expiration of License During Construction. - If a licensed contractor's license expires, for whatever reason, during construction, he may recover for only the work performed while he was duly licensed. If, in that situation, the contractor renews his
                        license during construction, he may recover for work performed before expiration and after renewal. If, by virtue of these rules, harsh results fall upon unlicensed contractors who violate the statutes, the contractors themselves
                        bear both the responsibility and the blame. Brady v. Fulghum, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the contractor was licensed at the significant moment of contracting; the contractor's license lapsed through inadvertence, not as a result of incompetence or disciplinary action by the licensing board; the contractor's license was renewed immediately
                        upon its filing of a renewal application and fees; and the contractor's financial condition and composition remained unchanged during the period the contractor was not licensed, although the contractor was not licensed for 90 percent
                        of the construction period, the factors listed above, particularly the reason for the license lapse and the automatic renewal thereof, confirming the contractor's continued competence and responsibility, indicate that the protective
                        purpose of the licensing statute has been satisfied such that the contractor should not be barred from recovering under its contract with owner. Barrett, Robert &amp; Woods, Inc. v. Armi, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C.

                        Subsequent Procurement of License Does Not Validate Contract. - The existence of a license at the time the contract is signed is determinative and great weight is attached to the significant moment of the entrance of the parties into the relationship.
                        Accordingly, a contract illegally entered into by an unlicensed general construction contractor is unenforceable by the contractor. It cannot be validated by the contractor's subsequent procurement of a license. Brady v. Fulghum,
                        <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 580</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 327 (1983).

                        Contract May Be Enforced Defensively. - Although an unlicensed contractor cannot affirmatively enforce his contract, a general contractor can enforce his contract defensively, as a set-off to the claims asserted against him, though the set-off cannot
                        exceed his adversary's claims. This exception limits the penalty paid by the unlicensed builder to the amount he actually expended on the contract and no more. Hickory Furn. Mart, Inc. v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite>                        626, 230 S.E.2d 609 (1976).

                        In enacting this section, the Legislature reasonably determined that as the cost of a structure increased, there would be additional demands of expertise and responsibilities from the contractor. To permit a general contractor to recover amounts in excess
                        of the allowable limit of his license would vitiate the intended purpose of this statute: to protect the public from incompetent builders. Sample v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 717</cite>, 319

                        A contractor who constructs a project, the value of which exceeds the amount of his license, may recover up to the amount authorized by his license for the owner's breach of contract, or for the value of the work and services furnished or materials supplied
                        under the contract on a theory of unjust enrichment. Sample v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 717</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 607 (1984), overruling Helms v. Dawkins, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C.

                        General contractor did not exceed the authority of its limited license when it built a house for the property owners despite the fact that the stated contract price was more than the $350,000 allowed for a limited license holder; the general contractor
                        only had control over the project regarding an amount less than $350,000, and, thus, should have been allowed to recover the property owners' unpaid balance owed to it. Hodgson Constr., Inc. v. Howard,

                        Contractor Should Have Been Allowed to Prove Case. - On appeal from summary judgment, where plaintiff contractor was licensed up to $175,000 (now $350,000) when the contract was executed, where, when two months later plaintiff secured an unlimited license,
                        plaintiff began construction during the two-month period, and where he presented his affidavit that he had passed the unlimited general contractor examination when the contract with defendants was executed and that he had done
                        approximately $2,800.00 worth of work before he was issued his unlimited license, the value of the work done by plaintiff was never in excess of his license limit, and plaintiff was not, as evidenced by his license, incompetent
                        to perform the work; thus, plaintiff should have been allowed to prove his case if he could and was entitled if successful to recover to the extent of his unlimited license and defend the counterclaim. Dellinger v. Michal,

                    notwithstanding the provisions of any other occupational licensing statute. A license issued by any other occupational licensing board having jurisdiction over any work described in G.S. 87-10 shall qualify such licensee to perform
                    the work for which the license qualifies him without obtaining the license from the General Contractors Licensing Board. Nothing contained herein shall operate to relieve any general contractor from the necessity of compliance with
                    other provisions of the law requiring building permits and construction in accordance with appropriate provisions of the North Carolina State Building Code.

                        Since this section restricts the practice of an otherwise lawful occupation to a special class of persons, it must be construed so as not to extend it to activities and transactions not intended by the legislature to be included. Fulton v. Rice,

                    <p>
                        Supervision by Licensed Employee When Person Acting as General Contractor Is Unlicensed. - Where record showed that plaintiff, although he was not licensed, acted as a general contractor in contracting to build defendants' house at a cost exceeding $30,000.00,
                        the order refusing to enforce plaintiff's contract and dismissing its claim against defendants was properly entered, even though the construction contracted for was supervised by its employee, a licensed general contractor. Hanover

                    <p>
                        Partnership could still bring action for quantum meruit even though signing partner was not licensed. - Because a partnership was not an unlicensed general contractor, and thus its claim was not barred by the licensing requirements, the property owners
                        could not use the licensing statutes as a shield to avoid any quantum meruit obligations owing to the partnership for the building of their home based on the fact that an individual partner, who signed the contract, was not licensed.

                        Recovery Barred. - Actions of plaintiff, who was not licensed and who performed general contracting, were illegal, and accordingly the defense of illegality barred plaintiff's recovery on note given by defendants covering work to be done to restore their
                        home. Daye v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 365 S.E.2d 660 (1988).

                        Jurisdiction to Impose Sanctions. - North Carolina State Board of Examiners of Plumbing, Heating, and Fire Sprinklers Contractors acted beyond its disciplinary jurisdiction by imposing sanctions upon a heating contractor who inspected the already installed

                        is not in itself arbitrary, unreasonable, or unjust. Roach v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 587</cite>, 169 S.E. 149 (1933).

                        A journeyman plumber, duly licensed under the ordinances of a municipality, who furnishes no materials, supplies or fixtures, but merely attaches or replaces fixtures, and does not install plumbing systems or make substantial alterations thereof, is not
                        engaged in carrying on the business of plumbing and heating contracting within this section, since plumbing is defined in the act in terms of the "plumbing system" and the act refers to plumbing and heating "contractors," and even
                        granting that the definition in the act is ambiguous and is susceptible to a construction which would include journeyman plumbers, the court could not adopt such construction, since the statute must be given that construction which
                        is favorable to defendant and tends least to interfere with personal liberty. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 244</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 567 (1940).

                <p>
                    All persons, firms, or corporations engaged in the business of either plumbing or heating contracting, or both, shall pay an annual license fee not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). The annual fee for a piping or restricted classification
                    license shall not exceed that for a plumbing or heating license. All persons, firms, or corporations engaged in the business of fire sprinkler contracting shall pay an initial application fee not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00)
                    and an annual license fee not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00). In the event the Board refuses to license an applicant, the license fee deposited shall be returned by the Board to the applicant. All licenses shall expire on
                    the last day of December in each year following their issuance or renewal. Persons who obtain a license by passing an examination on or after October 1 of any year may receive a license for the remainder of the year by paying one-half
                    of the usual license fee for that classification of license. It shall be the duty of the secretary and treasurer to send by United States mail or e-mail to every licensee registered with the Board, notice to the licensee's last known
                    address reflected on the records of the Board of the amount of fee required for renewal of license, the notice to be mailed at least one month in advance of the expiration of the license. The Board may require payment of all unpaid
                    annual fees before reissuing a license. In the event of failure on the part of any person, firm or corporation to renew the license certificate annually and pay the required fee during the month of January in each year, the Board shall
                    increase the license fee by twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to cover any additional expense associated with late renewal. The Board shall require reexamination upon failure of a licensee to renew license within three years after expiration.
                    The Board may adopt regulations requiring attendance at programs of continuing education as a condition of license renewal. A licensee employed full time as a local government plumbing, heating, or mechanical inspector and holding
                    qualifications from the Code Officials Qualifications Board may renew the license at a fee not to exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00).

                        of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit caused a business to experience significant leaks because the Administrative Officer and Field Investigator for the Board observed that no new pad and no new curb were

                    of Electrical Contractors in compliance with the provisions of this Article, regardless of whether the offer was made or the work was performed by a qualified individual as defined in G.S.87-41.1. In each separate place of business
                    operated by an electrical contractor at least one listed qualified individual shall be regularly on active duty and shall have the specific duty and authority to supervise and direct all electrical wiring or electrical installation
                    work done or made by such separate place of business. Every person, partnership, firm or corporation engaging in the business of electrical contracting shall display a current certificate of license in his principal place of business
                    and in each branch place of business which he operates. Licenses issued hereunder shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary-treasurer of the Board, under the seal of the Board. A registry of all licenses issued to electrical
                    contractors shall be kept by the secretary-treasurer of the Board, and said registry shall be open for public inspection during ordinary business hours.

                    one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and on which the equipment or installation in the contract is rated at not more than 600 volts; Intermediate, under which a licensee shall be permitted to engage in a single electrical contracting
                    project of a value, as established by the Board, not in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000); Unlimited, under which a licensee shall be permitted to engage in any electrical contracting project regardless of value; and
                    such other special Restricted classifications as the Board may establish from time to time to provide, (i) for the licensing of persons, partnerships, firms or corporations wishing to engage in special restricted electrical contracting,
                    under which license a licensee shall be permitted to engage only in a specific phase of electrical contracting of a special, limited nature, and (ii) for the licensing of persons, partnerships, firms or corporations wishing to engage
                    in electrical contracting work as an incidental part of their primary business, which is a lawful business other than electrical contracting, under which license a licensee shall be permitted to engage only in a specific phase of electrical
                    contracting of a special, limited nature directly in connection with said primary business. The Board may establish appropriate standards for each classification, such standards not to be inconsistent with the provisions of G.S. 87-42.
                    The Board may, by rule, modify the project value limitations up to the maximum amounts set forth in this section for limited and intermediate licenses no more than once every three years based upon an increase or decrease in the project
                    cost index for electrical projects in this State.

                    The General Assembly of North Carolina finds that improperly constructed, operated, maintained, or abandoned wells can adversely affect the public health and the groundwater resources of the State. Consistent with the duty to safeguard the public welfare,
                    safety, health and to protect and beneficially develop the groundwater resources of this State, it is declared to be the policy of this State to require that the location, construction, repair, and abandonment of wells, and the installation
                    of pumps and pumping equipment conform to such reasonable requirements as may be necessary to protect the public welfare, safety, health and groundwater resources.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly of North Carolina hereby declares as a matter of public policy that it is necessary to protect the citizens and workforce of this State from the dangers inherent in excavating or demolishing in areas where underground lines, systems,
                    or infrastructure are buried beneath the surface of the ground, and it is necessary to protect from costly damage underground facilities used for producing, storing, conveying, transmitting, or distributing communication, electricity,
                    gas, petroleum, petroleum products, hazardous liquids, water, steam, or sewage. In order to carry out this public policy and to satisfy these compelling interests, the General Assembly has enacted the provisions of this Article providing
                    for a systematic, orderly, and uniform process to identify existing facilities in advance of any excavation or demolition in this State and to implement safe digging practices.
