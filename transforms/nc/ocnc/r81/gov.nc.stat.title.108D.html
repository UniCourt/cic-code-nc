      “(f) CMS Approval. — The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Benefits, shall submit to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) any State Plan amendments necessary to establish the new Medicaid coverage required by this section. The new Medicaid covered services and rates shall be implemented July 1, 2022. If approval from CMS is not granted by July 1, 2022, DHB shall retroactively implement services and rates upon approval from CMS to July 1, 2022. The new Medicaid covered services and rates shall only be implemented to the extent allowable by CMS.

If an increase in capitation rates paid to LME/MCOs is necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of those paid capitation rates, then DHB shall increase the capitation rates by the minimum amount necessary for federal approval of the rates.

         An enrollee who receives long-term services and supports will be required to change residential, institutional, or employment supports providers due to the enrollee’s provider’s change from in-network to out-of-network status with the PHP and, as a result, the enrollee would experience a disruption in residence or employment.

     <p>
      “(1) The services requested are medically necessary and cannot be provided by an in-network provider.

     </p>
     <p>
      “(3) The behavioral health or IDD provider is not excluded from participation in the Medicaid program, the NC Health Choice program, or other State or federal health care program.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(4) The behavioral health or IDD provider is serving no more than two enrollees of the LME/MCO, unless the agreement is for inpatient hospitalization, in which case the LME/MCO may, but shall not be required to, enter into more than five such out-of-network agreements with a single hospital or health system in any 12-month period.
     </p>

OAH shall not conduct a hearing of any contested case involving a dispute of an adverse benefit determination until it has received notice from the mediator assigned that either (i) the mediation was unsuccessful, (ii) the petitioner has rejected the offer of mediation, or (iii) the petitioner has failed to appear at a scheduled mediation.

Upon the receipt of new evidence and at the request of the managed care entity, the administrative law judge shall continue the hearing for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 30 days in order to allow the managed care entity to review the evidence. Upon reviewing the evidence, if the managed care entity decides to reverse the adverse benefit determination, it shall immediately inform the administrative law judge of its decision.

     <p>
      “(4) The beneficiary has been in the care of the hospital for a minimum of 30 continuous hours.

      “Services developed in accordance with this subsection shall be considered outpatient services. Other ancillary services, such as laboratory services, imaging, and prescription drugs, shall continue to be billed as separate and additional services not included as part of this new Medicaid coverage. Notwithstanding G.S. 108D 35, any new services developed in accordance with this subsection shall be limited to beneficiaries enrolled in NC Medicaid Direct or in a BH IDD tailored plan, as defined in G.S. 108D 1.

The reimbursement amount shall be determined through negotiations between each hospital and LME/MCO.

      “(3) The level of BHUC unit occupancy during the BHUC pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(4) Additional objective outcome measures that demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of the BHUC pilot program, including the number of individuals presenting to a hospital emergency room with a behavioral health crisis and time spent by county and municipal law enforcement in responding to behavioral health crises.
