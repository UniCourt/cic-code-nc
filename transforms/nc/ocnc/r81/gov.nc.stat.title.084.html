       In order to determine whether members of a law firm should be held liable for the activities of one of its partners, the court should consider (1) the provisions of the instrument empowering the firm to practice law, such as partnership agreements and articles of incorporation, as well as statutory provisions; (2) the construction which our courts have historically given the questioned activity or related ones; (3) where the partner has acted, or seemed to act, with the firm’s authority; this includes his position in the firm, the participation — if any — by the rest of the firm in the disputed activities, and any assurances given the client that this transaction would be handled through the firm; and finally, (4) whether the other members of the firm have assented to or ratified the acts.

       Although the North Carolina courts apparently have not addressed the issue, most courts have concluded that although a non-attorney may not create a document for another person or advise on how the document should be prepared, merely typing or “scrivening” a petition or legal document for another person does not constitute the practice of law. This distinction has been made in dealing with petition preparers under 11 U.S.C.S. § 110. In re Lazarus, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 1093 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Mar. 14, 2005).

       It was not an abuse of discretion to disqualify a law firm’s attorneys from representing the firm in a fee collection case because (1) the attorneys would be necessary trial witnesses, the attorneys’ testimony would encompass material, disputed issues, and none of N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7’s exceptions applied, (2) N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7 literally supported disqualification, as the case did not involve the attorneys’ ability to represent the attorneys but to represent the firm in a suit against a third party while serving as witnesses for the firm as to disputed fact issues, and (3) the North Carolina Court of Appeals had no authority to create an exception to the Rule.

      <p>
       North Carolina’s unauthorized practice of law statutes probably fall under the savings provision set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(4) for “generally applicable” criminal law and are therefore probably not preempted by ERISA, due to the fact that violation of those statutes is a criminal offense; on the other hand, the unauthorized practice of law statutes are preempted by 31 C.F.R. §§ 10.2 and 10.3 to the extent that those statutes would restrict to licensed attorneys the preparation or the aiding in the preparation of documents necessary to establish ERISA plans qualified by the Internal Revenue Service. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. David Johnson, Committee Counsel, The North Carolina State Bar, Authorized Practice Committee, Pension Plan Subcommittee, 2003 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 4 (6/20/03).

      <p>
       In a criminal prosecution the trial court did not err in permitting the defendant’s retained counsel from Alabama to appear before the court in his behalf without complying strictly with the provisions of this section for two reasons. First, the defendant was allowed to have those counsel whom he wanted to defend him. They were retained by him and allowed to practice in the North Carolina courts on his motion. At no time during the proceedings did he express concern regarding their competency, and any such objection was waived. Secondly, the statute was not designed for his protection, and did not vest in him any rights to counsel other than what he would ordinarily possess in the absence of the statute.

       The power of attorney which a lawyer may be required to file, pursuant to this section, is some writing addressed to him by the client or an agent for the client.

     Government.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The government of the North Carolina State Bar is vested in a council of the North Carolina State Bar referred to in this Chapter as the “Council.” The Council shall be composed of a variable number of councilors equal to the number of judicial districts plus 16, the officers of the North Carolina State Bar, who shall be councilors during their respective terms of office, and each retiring president of the North Carolina State Bar who shall be a councilor for one year from the date of expiration of his term as president. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, the North Carolina State Bar may borrow money and may acquire, hold, rent, encumber, alienate, lease, and otherwise deal with real or personal property in the same manner as any private person or corporation, subject only to the approval of the Governor and the Council of State as to the borrowing of money and the acquisition, rental, encumbering, leasing and sale of real property. The Council shall be competent to exercise the entire powers of the North Carolina State Bar in respect of the interpretation and administration of this Article, the borrowing of money, the acquisition, lease, sale, or mortgage of property, real or personal, the seeking of amendments to this Chapter, and all other matters. There shall be one councilor from each judicial district and 16 additional councilors. The additional councilors shall be allocated and reallocated by the North Carolina State Bar every six years based on the number of active members of each judicial district bar according to the records of the North Carolina State Bar and in accordance with a formula to be adopted by the North Carolina State Bar, to insure an allocation based on lawyer population of each judicial district bar as it relates to the total number of active members of the State Bar.
     </p>
     <p>
      A councilor whose seat has been eliminated due to a reallocation shall continue to serve on the Council until expiration of the remainder of the current term. A councilor whose judicial district is altered by the General Assembly during the councilor’s term shall continue to serve on the Council until the expiration of the term and shall represent the district wherein the councilor resides or with which the councilor has elected to be affiliated. If before the alteration of the judicial district of the councilor the judicial district included both the place of residence and the place of practice of the councilor, and if after the alteration of the judicial district the councilor’s place of residence and place of practice are located in different districts, the councilor must, not later than 10 days from the effective date of the alteration of the district, notify the Secretary of the North Carolina State Bar of an election to affiliate with and represent either the councilor’s district of residence or district of practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the councilors, there shall be three public members not licensed to practice law in this or any other state who shall be appointed by the Governor. The public members may vote and participate in all matters before the Council to the same extent as councilors elected or appointed from the various judicial districts.

       North Carolina State Bar and the trial courts of this State share concurrent jurisdiction over matters of attorney discipline; therefore, where individual filed a civil claim against attorney for alleged impropriety in handling an estate, and also filed a grievance with the State Bar alleging that the attorney’s actions violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, the trial court erred in naming the State Bar as a party and dismissing the grievance proceeding against the defendant.

        North Carolina Court of Appeals Lacked Authority to Create Exception to Professional Conduct Rule. —

      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to disqualify a law firm’s attorneys from representing the firm in a fee collection case because (1) the attorneys would be necessary trial witnesses, the attorneys’ testimony would encompass material, disputed issues, and none of N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7’s exceptions applied, (2) N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.7 literally supported disqualification, as the case did not involve the attorneys’ ability to represent the attorneys but to represent the firm in a suit against a third party while serving as witnesses for the firm as to disputed fact issues, and (3) the North Carolina Court of Appeals had no authority to create an exception to the Rule.

     Admission to practice.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of examining applicants and providing rules and regulations for admission to the Bar including the issuance of license therefor, there is hereby created the Board of Law Examiners, which shall consist of 11 members of the Bar, elected by the Council, who need not be members of the Council. No teacher in any law school, however, shall be eligible. The members of the Board of Law Examiners elected from the Bar shall each hold office for a term of three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board of Law Examiners shall elect a member of the Board as chair thereof, and the Board may employ an executive secretary and provide such assistance as may be required to enable the Board to perform its duties promptly and properly. The chair and any employees shall serve for a period of time determined by the Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The examination shall be held in the manner and at the times as the Board of Law Examiners may determine.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board of Law Examiners shall have full power and authority to make or cause to be made such examinations and investigations as may be deemed by it necessary to satisfy it that the applicants for admission to the Bar possess the qualifications of character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor-at-law and to this end the Board of Law Examiners shall have the power of subpoena and to summons and examine witnesses under oath and to compel their attendance and the production of books, papers and other documents and writings deemed by it to be necessary or material to the inquiry and shall also have authority to employ and provide assistance as may be required to enable it to perform its duties promptly and properly. Records, papers, and other documents containing information collected and compiled by the Board or its members or employees as a result of investigations, inquiries, or interviews conducted in connection with examinations or licensing matters, are not public records within the meaning of Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      All applicants for admission to the Bar shall be fingerprinted to determine whether the applicant has a record of criminal conviction in this State or in any other state or jurisdiction. The information obtained as a result of the fingerprinting of an applicant shall be limited to the official use of the Board of Law Examiners in determining the character and general fitness of the applicant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Public Safety may provide a criminal record check to the Board of Law Examiners for a person who has applied for a license through the Board. The Board shall provide to the Department of Public Safety, along with the request, the fingerprints of the applicant, any additional information required by the Department of Public Safety, and a form signed by the applicant consenting to the check of the criminal record and to the use of the fingerprints and other identifying information required by the State or national repositories. The applicant’s fingerprints shall be forwarded to the State Bureau of Investigation for a search of the State’s criminal history record file, and the State Bureau of Investigation shall forward a set of the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history check. The Board shall keep all information pursuant to this subsection privileged, in accordance with applicable State law and federal guidelines, and the information shall be confidential and shall not be a public record under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Public Safety may charge each applicant a fee for conducting the checks of criminal history records authorized by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board of Law Examiners, subject to the approval of the Council, shall by majority vote, from time to time, make, alter, and amend such rules and regulations for admission to the Bar as in their judgment shall promote the welfare of the State and the profession: Provided, that no change in the educational requirements for admission to the Bar that establishes an additional or greater requirement shall become effective until two years after the date of the adoption of the change.

       While a state cannot exclude a person from the practice of law for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, a state can require high standards for admission to the bar, including good moral character and proficiency in its laws, so long as the qualifying standards have a rational connection with the applicant’s fitness or capacity to practice law.

       Under this section the board is the primary investigatory and fact-finding agency in the bar admissions process. When factual disputes are fairly brought before it, it must resolve them. No other agency exists to make such resolutions. In re Rogers,

       In determining an applicant’s fitness to practice law, the Board of Law Examiners should not conduct a hearing to consider applicant’s alleged commission of specific acts of misconduct and, without a finding that he committed the prior acts, use his denial that he committed them as substantive evidence of his lack of moral character; rather, the board should first determine whether in fact the applicant committed the prior acts of misconduct and, if it determines that he did, it must then say whether these acts so reflect on the applicant’s character that they are sufficient to rebut his prima facie showing of good character.

      <p>
       In cases in which all the essential facts either appear on the face of the application or are otherwise indisputably established, the board need only weigh the evidence and determine whether the applicant has shown his good moral character. However, even in such cases, while it might be permissible for the board not to make specific findings of fact, a detailing of the facts on which it bases its conclusions would facilitate judicial review.

       Where the only facts which could support a conclusion that the applicant did not show good moral character are in sharp dispute, the board must necessarily serve as the adjudicator of the facts in dispute and must ultimately find with regard to them what it believes the truth to be. Mere recitation of the testimony heard by the board will not suffice. Administrative agencies must find facts when factual issues are presented. They cannot fulfill this duty by merely summarizing the evidence. In re Rogers,

       When an applicant makes a prima facie showing of his good moral character and, to rebut the showing, the board relies on specific acts of misconduct the commission of which is denied by the applicant, the board must assume the burden of proving the specific acts by the greater weight of the evidence.

       To place the burden on the applicant to disprove acts of misconduct would be a distortion of the intended effect of the rule requiring the applicant to prove, overall, his good character.

       An applicant for admission to the bar has the burden of showing his good moral character. At the outset, he must come forward with sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case. The board, or any other person wishing to contest an application, may then offer rebuttal evidence. If there are material factual disputes, the board must resolve them by making findings of fact. If the disputes arise out of charges initially made before the board, the board must determine whether the charges have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence before it can rely on them in concluding that an applicant has not shown his good moral character.

       Good moral character is something more than the absence of bad character. It is the good name which the applicant has acquired, or should have acquired, through association with his fellows. It means that he must have conducted himself as a man of upright character ordinarily would, should or does. Such character expresses itself, not in negatives nor in following the line of least resistance, but quite often in the will to do the unpleasant thing, if it is right, and the resolve not to do the pleasant thing, if it is wrong.

        Disciplinary Hearing Commission did not err in concluding that an attorney intended to commit acts creating the potential for foreseeable harm because its findings supported the notion that the attorney’s wrongful acts were not by mistake or accident but were instead intentionally committed; the attorney approved of emails being sent on her behalf with the intent of targeting small businesses in need of legal services, and she intended to communicate to a client that she was an attorney.

        Under Laws 1870-1, c. 216, s. 4, upon which an action for disbarment was originally based, conviction of a “criminal offense” showing untrustworthiness was sufficient basis for disbarment; but by Laws 1907, c. 941, s. 1, conviction of a “felony” was necessary; construing these provisions together the court held that the two provisions were consistent and reconcilable (a view evidently adopted by the Revision Commission of 1920, as C.S., § 205 contained the language of both provisions), and further stated that the conviction of a criminal offense — the illegal sale of liquor — was sufficient grounds for disbarment as showing the attorney unfit for practice.

        Disciplinary commission’s finding that the attorney’s statements on his letterhead and website to the effect that the attorney had been published in the federal appellate court reporter were inherently misleading in multiple respects was supported by the “whole record” test; analysis of the whole record showed that the disciplinary commission’s finding was supported by substantial evidence and no abuse of discretion was shown in thus ordering as discipline that he be admonished.

         Collateral Attack on State Bar Decision to Disbar Attorney. —
        </b>

       <p>
        Former attorney’s suit, alleging that the North Carolina State Bar’s decision disbarring him was contrary to a State supreme court decision decided five years after his disbarment and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on certain constitutional arguments, was properly dismissed because, while the Bar was not a court of competent jurisdiction, the attorney could not present his claims in superior court because they were a collateral attack on a final judgment properly entered by the Bar, and the attorney did not avail himself of his right of appeal to the court under

         Failure to Appeal Renders Order Final and Insulated from Collateral Attack. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner, a suspended lawyer, filed a motion for reinstatement of his license to practice law. However, the lawyer was required to petition for such relief in the form and subject to the substantive rules set out in 27 N.C. Admin. Code § 01B.0125(b); his motion also represented an impermissible collateral attack on the Disciplinary Hearing Commission’s order refusing to reinstate his law license. When the lawyer failed to seek appellate review of the denial of his reinstatement petition in a timely manner, the order refusing to reinstate his license to practice law became final and thus was insulated from collateral attack.

       This section, giving the State Bar Council the discretion to reinstate the license to practice law of a disbarred attorney is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. In re Garrison, 44 N.C. App. 158, 260 S.E.2d 445,

       The council did not err in the denial of petitioner’s application for reinstatement
       
       of his license to practice law where there was evidence that petitioner had compromised four of the six civil judgments rendered against him but had failed to make restitution for two outstanding judgments against him in excess of $30,000, which he had been unable to compromise, and that petitioner also renounced funds which would have enabled him to help satisfy the judgments against him. Petitioner’s willingness to satisfy only the judgments that could be compromised, while failing to satisfy those not the subject of compromise, is evidence of the lack of proper reformation required by the statute.

     <p>
      Every active member of the North Carolina State Bar shall, prior to the first day of July of each year, pay to the secretary-treasurer an annual membership fee in an amount determined by the Council but not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00), and every member shall notify the secretary-treasurer of the member’s correct mailing address. Any member who fails to pay the required dues by the last day of June of each year shall be subject to a late fee in an amount determined by the Council but not to exceed thirty dollars ($30.00). All dues for prior years shall be as were set forth in the General Statutes then in effect. The membership fee shall be regarded as a service charge for the maintenance of the several services authorized by this Article, and shall be in addition to all fees required in connection with admissions to practice, and in addition to all license taxes required by law. The fee shall not be prorated: Provided, that no fee shall be required of an attorney licensed after this Article shall have gone into effect until the first day of January of the calendar year following that in which the attorney was licensed; but this proviso shall not apply to attorneys from other states admitted on certificate. The fees shall be disbursed by the secretary-treasurer on the order of the Council. The secretary-treasurer shall annually, at a time and in a law magazine or daily newspaper to be prescribed by the Council, publish an account of the financial transactions of the Council in a form to be prescribed by it. The secretary-treasurer shall compile and keep currently correct from the names and mailing addresses forwarded to the secretary-treasurer and from any other available sources of information a list of members of the North Carolina State Bar and furnish to the clerk of the superior court in each county, not later than the first day of October in each year, a list showing the name and address of each attorney for that county who has not complied with the provisions of this Article. The name of each of the active members who are in arrears in the payment of membership fees shall be furnished to the presiding judge at the next term of the superior court after the first day of October of each year, by the clerk of the superior court of each county wherein the member or members reside, and the court shall thereupon take action that is necessary and proper. The names and addresses of attorneys so certified shall be kept available to the public. The Secretary of Revenue is hereby directed to supply the secretary-treasurer, from records of license tax payments, with any information for which the secretary-treasurer may call in order to enable the secretary-treasurer to comply with this requirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The list submitted to several clerks of the superior court shall also be submitted to the Council at its October meeting of each year and it shall take the action thereon that is necessary and proper.

       This inherent power is co-equal and co-extensive with the statutory grant of powers to the North Carolina State Bar, and, while the interests of the two entities having disciplinary jurisdiction may, and often do, overlap, they are not always identical and as the interests sought to be protected by the court’s inherent power are distinct from those of the North Carolina State Bar, the action of a court in disciplining or disqualifying an attorney practicing before it is not in derogation or to the exclusion of similar action by the Bar.

       The power of the court to regulate and discipline attorneys is an inherent one because it is an essential one for the court to possess in order for it to protect itself from fraud and impropriety and to serve the ends of the administration of justice which are, fundamentally, the raison d’etre for the existence and operation of the courts.

       While it is incontrovertible that the courts have inherent authority to take disciplinary action against attorneys practicing therein, even in relation to matters not pending in the particular court exercising that authority, it is not after the manner of the courts, however, to deprive a lawyer, any more than anyone else, of his constitutional guaranties or to revoke his license without due process of law.
