         Jurisdiction of Court to Make Award. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a successor judge lacked jurisdiction to overrule a prior judge’s denial of summary judgment and to award summary judgment to plaintiffs on their second claim for relief, a valid judgment was not awarded to the plaintiffs so that they were not to be considered the prevailing parties; thus, there was not a statutory basis for the award of costs to the plaintiffs. Cail v. Cerwin, 185 N.C. App. 176, 648 S.E.2d 510,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         2007 N.C. App. LEXIS 1684

        In a medical malpractice action, the trial court erred by taxing costs against a doctor and a medical center, pursuant to
        <cite class="ocnc">

          G.S. 6-1

        , as the order taxing the costs was made after the appeal was filed, therefore, the trial court lacked subject matter to enter the order.

         Costs Follow the Judgment. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In general this section states the rule that costs follow the judgment, a rule which is founded on policy and natural justice, designed to prevent the unsuccessful litigant from escaping the consequence ensuing from the unfavorable termination of a suit, and which, to a great extent, acts as deterrent to the prosecution or appeal of promiscuous and frivolous litigation. Criminal actions and civil suits alike are controlled by the principle. In State v. Horne,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         119 N.C. 853
        </cite>
        , 26 S.E. 36 (1896), it is said: “There is no exception in State cases to the rule prevailing in civil cases that the costs follow the result of the final judgment.” The true and only test of liability for costs depends upon the nature of the final judgment, and the party cast in the suit is the one upon whom the costs must fall.

        Trial judges are authorized to tax court costs,
        
        and if the court misused its authority in taxing costs against pauper plaintiff, that error was waived by her failure to appeal therefrom. Schaffner v. Pantelakos, 98 N.C. App. 399, 391 S.E.2d 41,

        The power to make an allowance of attorneys’ fees from a fund brought into court

With the power of award being limited to items of reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, so as to exclude compensation or allowance of any kind for the time and effort of the suing taxpayer, thus fixing it so the taxpayer may not capitalize on the suit, there is no real danger of abuse.

        Because plaintiff’s legal fees and other costs were not recoverable as independent damages on a fraud claim, and he did not allege that he suffered any other damage, he failed to prove that he suffered legally cognizable damages as a result of a misrepresentation by defendant. Under North Carolina law, a successful litigant could not recover attorneys’ fees, whether as costs or as an item of damages, unless such a recovery was expressly authorized by statute, and costs were recoverable only in certain listed types of cases, none of which applied, or at the discretion of the court to a prevailing party, which necessarily meant establishing a prima facie case that, in the context of fraud, had to include independent damages aside from costs.

         Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys’ Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys’ fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys’ fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk, 238 N.C. App. 376, 767 S.E.2d 632,

       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys’ fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys’ fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys’ fees. Lacey v. Kirk, 238 N.C. App. 376, 767 S.E.2d 632,

       </p>
       <p>
        Although attorneys’ fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys’ fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise reasonable attorneys’ fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys’ fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.

       Words “other than” exclude from the broader class of “any civil actions” certain specified actions listed immediately after the words “other than,” and the phrase “an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate” is modified by the exclusionary words of “other than”; it follows that the exclusionary words also modify the phrase “a disciplinary action by a licensing board,” which similarly begins with a singular indefinite article.

       Syntax of the statute, i.e., the phrase “in any civil action brought by the State,” is separate and distinct from the phrase “other than an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate, or a disciplinary action by a licensing board”; this distinction exists as a means of delineating what is and is not within the scope of the statute and supports the interpretation of disciplinary actions as being categorized with the other exception to the statute.

       Because the phrase “a disciplinary action by a licensing board” is designated with the indefinite article “a,” and is separated from the rest of the statute by way of commas, the plain language of the statute conveys the legislature’s intent to exclude disciplinary actions by licensing boards from the purview of the statute.

       In a dispute involving a driveway, attorney fees were properly not awarded because, assuming that the trial court erred by concluding that the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) acted with substantial justification, it also denied the award of fees in its discretion; an argument that the trial court was required to award attorney fees if the DOT acted without substantial justification and no special circumstances existed that made an award of attorney’s fees unjust was rejected.

       In order to further the legislature’s purpose of reining in wanton, unfounded litigation, the State’s action for purposes of this section is measured by the phrase “substantial justification”. Thus, the agency is required to demonstrate that its position, at and from the time of its initial action, was rational and legitimate to such degree that a reasonable person could find it satisfactory or justifiable in light of the circumstances then known to the agency.

The respondent accepted the petitioner’s contributions after she began to take half year leaves of absence as part of a job sharing agreement and continued to represent to her that she was a full-fledged member of the retirement system until she prepared to collect her benefits at which time the respondent first informed petitioner that she was not a retirement system member although the North Carolina Administrative Code allowed for periods of interrupted employment.

       Department of Health and Human Services rested on the plain meaning of the relevant statutory provisions and even if the appellate court declined to accept the interpretation of the statutory language advanced by DHHS, it would have reached the conclusion that the agency’s refusal to acquiesce in the husband’s interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions rested on a reasonable view of the controlling legal authorities. As a result, the appellate court was unable to agree with the trial court that the DHHS’ position lacked substantial justification; thus, an award of attorney fees to the wife was improper. Joyner v.

       Even since the abolition of the courts of equity in this State, it is held that where the case partakes of an equitable nature, the question of costs is in the court’s discretion. Thus where the jury found that each party was entitled to an undivided half in land, and the appeal was from taxing the defendant with costs, there being no element of an action in ejectment, neither party was permitted to recover costs from the other, especially as the question was of an equitable nature, and the taxing of costs was, under this section, in the sound discretion of the court.

       Because plaintiff’s legal fees and other costs were not recoverable as independent damages on a fraud claim, and he did not allege that he suffered any other damage, he failed to prove that he suffered legally cognizable damages as a result of a misrepresentation by defendant. Under North Carolina law, a successful litigant could not recover attorneys’ fees, whether as costs or as an item of damages, unless such a recovery was expressly authorized by statute, and costs were recoverable only in certain listed types of cases, none of which applied, or at the discretion of the court to a prevailing party, which necessarily meant establishing a prima facie case that, in the context of fraud, had to include independent damages aside from costs.

        An offer of judgment for more than $5,000, together with costs then accrued, but excluding attorneys’ fees, is valid. This section would not apply in this case and “costs then accrued” would therefore not include attorneys’ fees incurred after the offer of judgment was made. The mere fact that judgment for less than $5,000 is later obtained should have no bearing on costs accrued at the time the offer was made.

        This section does not provide for the recovery of a reasonable attorneys’ fee in addition to the court costs but “as a part of the court costs.” Where the acceptance by the plaintiff of an offer of judgment for a specified sum plus “costs” proceeded from a reasonable interpretation by the plaintiff that “costs” included attorneys’ fees, then if such interpretation was not intended by the defendant, the misunderstanding was due to ambiguous language used by the defendant in making his offer and the defendant must bear any loss resulting therefrom.

       In looking to whether creditor’s claim for prepetition attorneys’ fees as part of an unsecured claim would be disallowed pursuant to any agreement or applicable law, the court interpreted a provision of North Carolina law governing fee awards where there was a contractual agreement to pay reasonable fees that did not specify any percentage to require looking at evidence of reasonableness, up to a statutory cap of 15 percent. However, even assuming arguendo that the language “reasonable attorneys’ fees” entitled creditor to a statutory award of 15 percent, the allowance of claims in bankruptcy was controlled by federal law, and the court exercised its equitable power to disallow a per se award of 15 percent in this case as unreasonable.

       by treating those who bring frivolous suits against indigent parties differently from those who bring frivolous suits against parties who can afford to retain their own counsel; therefore, the trial court’s limitation of the attorneys’ fee award to the court-appointed rate of $35.00 per hour was error.

       Where, although building owner filed complaint in civil court, case had already been submitted for arbitration and was settled by the award of the arbitrators, this section did not apply to authorize the trial court to award attorneys’ fees incurred in the arbitration hearing; in order for the trial court to make such an award, the “civil action” or “special proceeding” providing the basis for the award must have been held before that tribunal or pursuant to its authority, and no order other than the order which placed the case in inactive status had been entered, nor had any action been taken in the superior court.

        Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys’ Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys’ fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys’ fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk, 238 N.C. App. 376, 767 S.E.2d 632,

      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys’ fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys’ fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys’ fees. Lacey v. Kirk, 238 N.C. App. 376, 767 S.E.2d 632,

      </p>
      <p>
       Although attorneys’ fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys’ fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise reasonable attorneys’ fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys’ fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.

       In a dispute over the regulation of spray irrigation systems, a trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding costs and attorney fees because it had been determined that a county agency was preempted from inspecting the systems by state law. It was not established that the decision to award costs and fees was so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. Phillips v. Orange County Health Dep't, 237 N.C.

       District court had authority to award a developer attorneys fees on its state law claims seeking a refund of impact fees where it found that the county acted outside the scope of its legal authority by requiring the developer to pay the invalid impact fees as a condition of receiving building permits and collecting those fees on behalf of a water and sewer district.

If a greater number of witnesses have been summoned than were, in the opinion of the court, necessary to support the charge, the court may, even though it is of the opinion that there was reasonable ground for the prosecution, order the prosecuting witness to pay the attendance fees of such witnesses, if it appear that they were summoned at the prosecuting witness’s special request.

        Standing to Challenge Section. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff lacked standing to put in issue the constitutionality of this section where he was under no present threat of prosecution under these statutes, the likelihood that he would run afoul of them in the future was remote and speculative in the extreme, and it could be safely assumed that he did not contemplate either presently or in the future the institution of a prosecution in North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 10058 (4th Cir. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that earlier the plaintiff was caught in the net of the challenged statutes gave him no standing, where his earlier encounter with the statutes had become moot, the costs assessed were paid, and he was no longer restrained. Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 10058 (4th Cir. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that the statutes may chill in some indefinable way the urge to prosecute is of no moment in the absence of any real likelihood that plaintiff has or will have reason to prosecute someone in North Carolina.

      <p>
       A grant of a declaratory judgment that this section was invalid and unconstitutional was held to be outside the equitable jurisdiction of the federal court for the reasons that no bad faith had been alleged, nor any harassment, nor any impediment to the resolution of the constitutional validity in the General Court of Justice of North Carolina. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14553 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 10058 (4th Cir. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The taxing of costs to a prosecuting witness is a constituent part of the criminal procedure of North Carolina. Comity precludes not only the injunction of criminal proceedings in the state courts, but also any disruptive interference thereof. Therefore, only when the whole proceeding may be enjoined does the federal district court have jurisdiction to intervene in any way in the operation of this section. Fowler v. Alexander, 340 F. Supp. 168, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14553 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 694, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 10058 (4th Cir. 1973).
