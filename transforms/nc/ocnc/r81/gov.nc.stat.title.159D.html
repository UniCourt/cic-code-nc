       The General Assembly finds and determines that there exists in the State a critical condition of unemployment and a scarcity of employment opportunities; that the economic insecurity which results from such unemployment and scarcity of employment opportunities constitutes a serious menace to the safety, morals and general welfare of the entire State; that such unemployment and scarcity of employment opportunities have caused many workers and their families, including young adults upon whom future economic prosperity is dependent, to migrate elsewhere to find employment and establish homes; that such emigration has resulted in a reduced rate of growth in the tax base of the counties and other local governmental units of the State which impairs the financial ability of such counties and other local governmental units to support education and other local governmental services; that such unemployment results in obligations to grant public assistance and to pay unemployment compensation; that the aforesaid conditions can best be remedied by the attraction, stimulation, expansion and rehabilitation and revitalization of industrial and manufacturing facilities for industry in the State; and that there is a need to stimulate a larger flow of private investment funds into industrial building programs in the State.

       The General Assembly further finds and determines that the development and expansion of industry within the State, which are essential to the economic growth of the State, and to the full employment and prosperity of its people, are accompanied by the increased production and discharge of gaseous, liquid, and solid pollution and wastes which threaten and endanger the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the State by polluting the air, land and waters of the State; that in order to reduce, control, and prevent such environmental pollution, it is imperative that action be taken at various levels of government to require the provision of devices, equipment and facilities for the collection, reduction, treatment, and disposal of such pollution and wastes; that the assistance provided in this Article, especially with respect to financing, is therefore in the public interest and serves a public purpose of the State in promoting the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the State not only physically by collecting, reducing, treating and preventing environmental pollution but also economically by securing and retaining private industry thereby maintaining a higher level of employment and economic activity and stability.

The agency shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be that officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by reason of increased construction costs or error in estimates or otherwise, are less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficiency.

      Session Laws 2002-172, s. 5.1, provides: “The General Assembly finds that there are small manufacturing companies in the State that are eligible for industrial development bond financing for capital improvements and expansions, but are not able to take advantage of that financing because of the administrative costs involved. This problem can be addressed by reviving the composite bond program under Chapter 159D of the General Statutes, under which the North Carolina Capital Facilities Finance Agency could combine several series of bonds into a single bond offering, thereby reducing transaction costs and permitting eligible small manufacturers to access tax exempt financing for capital investments. The composite bond program would be facilitated by the changes proposed to Chapter 159D in this part [Part 5 of Session Laws 2002-172] that will streamline the procedures for composite issues by requiring only one public hearing and align the review standard for bonds issued as part of a composite bond program with the standard for bonds issued by county industrial development projects.”

      It is declared that for the benefit of the people of the State of North Carolina, the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity and the improvement of their health and living conditions it is essential that they be given the fullest opportunity to learn and to develop their intellectual capacities; that it is essential for institutions for higher education and institutions for elementary and secondary education within the State to be able to construct and renovate facilities to assist its citizens in achieving the fullest development of their intellectual capacities; and that it is the purpose of this Article to provide a measure of assistance and an alternative method to enable private institutions for higher education and institutions for elementary and secondary education in the State to provide the facilities and the structures that are needed to accomplish the purposes of this Article, all to the public benefit and good, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further declared that this purpose will benefit the people as a way to improve student learning, increase learning opportunities for all students, encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods, create new professional opportunities for teachers, provide parents and students with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available, and lower the overall cost of education to the State and to parents and students.
     </p>
     <p>
      The General Assembly also finds that the private sector often provides services and opportunities to the people of the State of North Carolina in activities that constitute a public purpose, and that these activities by the private sector are to be fostered and encouraged. The people of the State of North Carolina will benefit from the enactment of laws and creation of programs that assist the private sector in obtaining financing for capital improvements of facilities that will be used in conducting these activities.

      In the discretion of the agency any bonds or notes issued under the provisions of this Article may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the agency and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or notes may pledge or assign all or any part of the revenues of the agency received pursuant to this Article, including, without limitation, fees, loan repayments, purchase price payments, rents, charges, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards and any other revenues and funds received in connection with any project and may grant a deed of trust or a mortgage on any project. Such trust agreement or resolution may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the holders of any such bonds or notes as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the agency in relation to the purposes to which bond or note proceeds may be applied, the disposition or pledging of the revenues of the agency, including any payments in respect of any federally guaranteed security or any federally insured mortgage note, the duties of the agency with respect to the acquisition, construction, maintenance, repair and operation of any project, the fees, loan repayments, purchase price payments, rents and charges to be fixed and collected in connection therewith, the terms and conditions for the issuance of additional bonds or notes, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. All bonds issued under this Article shall be equally and ratably secured by a pledge, charge, and lien upon revenues provided for in such trust agreement or resolution, without priority by reason of number, or of dates of bonds, execution, or delivery, in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of such trust agreement or resolution; except that the agency may provide in such trust agreement or resolution that bonds issued pursuant thereto shall to the extent and in the manner prescribed in such trust agreement or resolution be subordinated and junior in standing, with respect to the payment of principal and interest and the security thereof, to any other bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or notes, revenues or other money hereunder to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the agency. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set off the rights and remedies, including foreclosure of any deed of trust or mortgage, of the holders of any bonds or notes and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by any such holders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the agency considers reasonable and proper for the security of the holders of any bonds or notes. Expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of any project or paid from the revenues pledged or assigned to the payment of the principal of and the interest on bonds or notes or from any other funds available to the agency.
