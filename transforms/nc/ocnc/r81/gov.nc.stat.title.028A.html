                            Section 7A-241 does not say that concurrent jurisdiction in probate matters is vested in the clerk and the judge of the superior court. It says that probate jurisdiction is vested in the superior court division to be exercised by the superior court and
                            the clerk according to the practice and procedure provided by law. The law, that is, the statutes specifying this practice and procedure, has allocated the jurisdiction between the clerk and the judge. By this section the clerk
                            is given exclusive original jurisdiction of “the administration, settlement and distribution of estates of decedents” except in cases where the clerk is disqualified to act under

                            In an appeal from an order of the clerk in a probate matter, the superior court is not required to conduct a de novo hearing. Rather, when a finding of fact by the clerk of court is properly challenged by specific exception, the superior court judge will
                            review those findings, and either affirm, reverse, or modify them. If he deems it advisable, he may submit the issue to a jury, which course he could not follow without hearing evidence. In re Estate of Longest, 74 N.C. App.

                            In plaintiff’s action to recover for breach of fiduciary duties, negligence, and fraud arising from administration of her husband’s estate and a trust created under his will, dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the claims
                            alleged should be brought initially before the clerk was improper, since the claims were “justiciable matters of a civil nature,” original general jurisdiction over which was vested in the trial division, and though the claims
                            arose from administration of an estate, their resolution was not a part of the administration, settlement, or distribution thereof so as to make jurisdiction properly exercisable initially by the clerk; moreover, inclusion
                            by plaintiff in her complaint of matters of which should have been brought initially before the clerk did not require dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction of the entire action. Ingle v. Allen, 53 N.C. App. 627,

                            Judgment granting defendant administrator’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action was affirmed where (1) plaintiff’s action involved claims for offsets against certain creditors’ claims against
                            the estate and her assertions that various claims by creditors were collectable from the Family Trust; (2) plaintiff also sought protection of her contributions to the Family Trust and contended that the estate’s assets should
                            be marshaled by defendant so that he could provide an accounting; and (3) these issues were “a part of” the administration of the estate and were thus properly handled by the clerk. Livesay v. Carolina First Bank, 200 N.C.

                        property as against innocent purchasers for value and without notice, unless it is probated or offered for probate within two years after the death of the testator or devisor or prior to the time of approval of the final account
                        of a duly appointed administrator of the estate of the deceased, whichever time is earlier. If such will is fraudulently suppressed, stolen or destroyed, or has been lost, and an action or proceeding shall be commenced within two
                        years from the death of the testator or devisor to obtain said will or establish the same as provided by law, then the limitation herein set out shall only begin to run from the termination of said action or proceeding, but not

                        The word “probate” when used in reference to a document purporting to be a will means the judicial process by which a court of competent jurisdiction in a duly constituted proceeding tests the validity of the instrument before the court, and ascertains
                        whether or not it is the last will of the deceased. In re Marks' Will,

                        It is obvious from this section that the classification of a “person interested in the estate” includes persons who are neither devisees nor legatees. It is broad enough to include even a person whose interest in the estate is in opposition to the will.

                        The designation of a person who exhibited a document for probate as “one of the executors therein named,” though inaccurate, is not an affirmative showing that he was not a “person interested in the estate” and, therefore, does not show affirmatively
                        that the document was presented for probate by a person not authorized by this section to do so. In re Estate of Davis,

                        the clause “any . . . person interested in the estate” includes a person who will share in the estate under the law governing intestacy in case a script which purports to be the will of the deceased is adjudged invalid as a testamentary

                    shall, by order of the clerk of the superior court, be committed to the jail of the county, there to remain without bail till such will be produced or accounted for, and due submission made for the contempt.

                        The requirements of this section did not obtain in the probate of a will in the old practice before the court of pleas and quarter sessions; and where the records show that a will sought to be set aside for improper probate, valid on its face, has been
                        transcribed upon the records of that court, it is presumed to have been duly admitted to probate and properly transcribed upon the record, the burden being upon the caveator to show to the contrary. Poplin v. Hatley,

                        Probate of a will by the clerk of the superior court is a judicial act, and his certificate is conclusive evidence of the validity of the will, until vacated on appeal, or declared void by a competent tribunal in a proceeding instituted for that purpose.

                        Formerly the court of pleas and quarter sessions had jurisdiction of the probate of wills, and there was at that time no provision in the statute requiring the taking of the proofs in writing or for recording the probate. The practice was to exhibit the
                        will before the court and offer the proofs of execution, and for an entry to be made upon the minutes of the adjudication, and the clerk, acting upon the authority of the court, then recorded the will upon the will book. In most
                        instances he also recorded a memorandum of the proceedings before the court, but this was not done in all cases. Poplin v. Hatley,

        Handwriting Goes to Jury on Testimony of Three Witnesses. —

                        Testimony of three witnesses that the paper-writing propounded as the holographic will of decedent was in his handwriting takes the case to the jury as to this requirement, notwithstanding conflicting testimony of caveator. In re Williams' Will,

                        In an action to probate a destroyed holographic will, the propounder must show that the instrument in the handwriting of the deceased and signed by him once existed and was destroyed under circumstances that would defeat an inference of revocation. Upon
                        failure of such proof, there is a failure of the proof of the res and a nonsuit is proper. Hewett v. Murray,

                    <p>
                        Statutory provisions in relation to nuncupative wills have existed in this State since 1784, and they originally were substantially the same as those in the English Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II, ch. 3, G.S. 19, 20. These provisions have always been strictly
                        construed and enforced by the courts, both in this State and in England. Smith v. Smith,
                        <cite class="nc_code">

                    <p>
                        The purpose of the statute is not to prevent the examination of the witnesses of the will, after such lapse of six months, on the trial of the issue devisavit vel non in the course of a contest of it, but it is to require that they shall not be allowed
                        to prove it in the first instance, when it is first presented for probate after that time, unless it shall have been put in writing within 10 days next after the making thereof. In re Haygood's Will,

                        The requisites of this statutory provision must be strictly complied with and observed, in all material respects, in order to prevent opportunity for fraudulent practices on the part of such persons as would be disposed to obtain undue advantage of persons
                        in their last sickness as to the final disposition of their property; and also to prevent mischiefs that might arise from the ignorance, misapprehension or dishonest purposes of persons called upon to be the witnesses of such wills.
                        The purpose of such requisites is to prevent the fabrication of such wills; they are necessary, and it is essential to observe them strictly. Brown v. Brown,

                        It is sufficient that the testator saw the witnesses and charged them to bear witness to his will, and they did so, and it is not a good objection that he failed to designate them particularly by name. That he required them, each, all of them, to bear
                        witness, was what the section requires. The purpose is that the testator shall require two witnesses at least to take notice and bear witness that he makes his will. He must require and direct a competent person, and that person
                        must be able to testify that he was one of the persons — the witnesses — so required, and that he did take notice and bear witness. Long v. Foust,

                        Under this section, it is sufficient to show, on the question of the testator’s requesting that the witness “bear witness” to the will, that believing himself to be in extremis, he told the witness during his last illness that he wanted to make a will,
                        who, at his request, called in another and while they were at his bedside, testator gave specific directions for the disposition of his personal property; and though he had therefore expressed his wish to make a written will, and
                        had failed in his effort to do so, the matters sought to be established as the nuncupative will were declared at a time when he was apprehensive that he would become unable to talk, and about four days before his death. In re Garland's

                        A just interpretation of the provision relative to the proof of a nuncupative will is, that if such will shall be put in writing within 10 days next after it was made, it may be proved by the witnesses thereof either before or after the lapse of six months
                        next after the making thereof, because the will being in writing with the sanction of the witnesses, their recollection so as to what it was is helped and strengthened thereby, and they could the better be trusted to testify as
                        to the making of the same, and what it was in its detail, at any time within a reasonable period. In re Haygood's Will,

                        recorded in another county becomes void and one who purchases with notice of the caveat cannot convey any title thereunder, either before or after notice of its invalidity has been filed in the county where the certified copy has

                        Instead of offering a will of a nonresident dying outside the State and disposing of property in the State for original probate in this State, the interested parties may have it probated in the state in which the testator was domiciled. When probated
                        according to the laws of that state, an exemplified copy of the will and the probate proceedings may be brought to this State and probated here. Such a will, unless probated in accordance with the laws of this State, is not sufficient
                        to dispose of real property in this State. It has no efficacy for any purpose in this State until probated here, but when probated here on the exemplified copy, it suffices to pass title to personalty and the right to enforce claims
                        which testator could assert against citizens or properties in this State, even though not executed or proven as required by the laws of this State. In re Marks' Will,

                            Petitioner, an heir at law and beneficiary under will, had a higher preference of appointment than respondent, who was neither an heir nor a beneficiary, and as the respondent should not have been appointed administrator C.T.A. without notice to the petitioner,
                            it was not error for the clerk to correct this error by removing the respondent as administrator C.T.A. The fact that petitioner may not have been qualified to serve as administrator C.T.A. under G.S. 28A-4-2(4) because she
                            was a nonresident of this State who had not appointed a process agent was irrelevant. In re Estate of Cole, 80 N.C. App. 720, 343 S.E.2d 263,

                            Upon appeal from the order of the clerk of superior court the petitioners were entitled to a de novo hearing by the judge of superior court on both the right of respondent to qualify as administratrix and her right to share in the estate of her deceased
                            husband. And the judge of superior court in the exercise of his inherent powers had the right to submit to the jury the one issue that would resolve both the right to qualify as administratrix, a probate matter, and the right
                            to share in the decedent’s estate, which is not a probate matter. In re Estate of Adamee, 28 N.C. App. 229, 221 S.E.2d 370,

                            Statutory specifications of disqualifications for service as a personal representative cannot be superseded by the broad general policy of the law which gives effect to the desires of a testator and sees that his intentions are carried out so far as they

                            When it appears that the personal interests of the prospective executor are so antagonistic to the interests of the estate and those entitled to its distribution that the same person cannot fairly represent both, the testator’s nominee is unsuitable and
                            disqualified as a matter of law. This is especially true where the conflict is one which the testator did not know or foresee. In re Estate of Moore,

                            Petitioner, an heir at law and beneficiary under will, had a higher preference of appointment than respondent, who was neither an heir nor a beneficiary, and as the respondent should not have been appointed administrator C.T.A. without notice to the petitioner,
                            it was not error for the clerk to correct this error by removing the respondent as administrator C.T.A. The fact that petitioner may not have been qualified to serve as administrator C.T.A. under subdivision (4) of this section

                        The true intent and meaning of this section is that the persons primarily entitled to administration may have six months (now 90 days) after the death of the intestate to assert their rights and comply with the law; and a party wishing to quicken their
                        diligence within that time must do so by citation — he may not, by obtaining letters within six months (now 90 days), deprive the party primarily entitled to administration should such party apply for letters before the expiration
                        of the six months’ (now 90-day) period. Williams v. Neville,

                        Failure to give a bond or the giving of an insufficient bond is only an irregularity, in no way affecting the validity of the appointment. The irregularity makes the letters of administration voidable only — a condition which may be cured by full compliance
                        with the statute since the letters once issued are not subject to collateral attack. In re Estate of Pitchi,

                        The mere fact that the bond of the representative is not justified before or approved by the clerk does not render the appointment void, or necessarily voidable. The provisions of this section requiring bond are directory and not essential to the appointment.
                        The only effect of noncompliance with these requirements is that the representative may be made to give the proper bond required. Garrison v. Cox,

                    office, or that the personal representative be required to give security to indemnify the petitioner against apprehended loss, or that the petitioner be discharged as surety and be released from liability for any future breach of the
                    bond. The clerk of superior court shall conduct a hearing in accordance with Article 2 of this Chapter. If, upon the hearing, the clerk of superior court determines that the surety is entitled to relief, the clerk may grant the same
                    in such manner as to serve the best interest of the estate. In any event, however, the previous surety shall not be released from liability for any breach of duty by the personal representative occurring prior to the filing of bond
                    with a new surety unless the new surety assumes liability for the earlier breaches.

                <p>
                    Any person injured by the breach of any bond given by a personal representative or collector may institute a civil action against one or more of the obligors of the bond and recover such damages as the person may have sustained. Any successor personal
                    representative, or any other personal representative of the same decedent, may institute such action on behalf of the persons interested in the estate. Any such action against one or more of the obligors of the bond shall be brought
                    in the name of the State of North Carolina and shall be instituted in the county in which letters were issued to the personal representative or collector, and the clerk of superior court shall give notice of the institution of the
                    action in such manner as the clerk may determine to all other persons shown by the clerk’s records to be interested in the estate. The bond of the personal representative is not void after the first or any subsequent recovery thereon
                    until the entire penalty is recovered. If the plaintiff fails to prevail, costs may be taxed against the person or persons for whose benefit the action on a personal representative’s bond is prosecuted.

                        The administrator de bonis non must first sue on the bond of a defaulting executor who preceded him, before he can obtain a license to sell the real estate for the payment of the debts. Carlton v. Byers,

                            Although the trial court found that decedent’s wrongful death proceeds were not assets of the estate, the clerk retained authority to oversee the distribution of the proceeds as a result of its power to order an accounting of estate assets, to remove
                            the defendant as the estate’s personal representative, to impose sanctions against her based upon alleged misconduct concerning the proceeds, and to order the proceeds submitted to the clerk or public administrator; although
                            wrongful death actions may not yield assets for the estate, a personal representative’s authority to commence and settle these actions is “incident to the collection, preservation, liquidation [and] distribution of a decedent’s

                            Proceeding to remove an executor and a civil suit for damages are not the same cause of action. The proceeding to remove an executor is purely statutory, with probate jurisdiction vested in the clerk of superior court, and reviewable by a superior court
                            judge on appeal. A civil suit for damages involves a full trial with the right to have factual issues resolved by a jury. Shelton v. Fairley, 72 N.C. App. 1, 323 S.E.2d 410,

                            Prejudice would result if, when beneficiaries sought to remove an executor, they were held to an election of remedies and could not later bring a civil action for damages. Such a policy would either chill exercise of the right to seek statutory removal

                        To say that the superior court has jurisdiction to hear a probate matter only upon an appeal from a final judgment entered below does not mean that the judge can review the record only to ascertain whether there have been errors of law. He also reviews

                    <p>
                        It is sometimes said that, upon an appeal from an order of the clerk made in the performance of his duties as judge of probate, the jurisdiction of the judge of the superior court is derivative. Such derivative jurisdiction is construed to mean, inter
                        alia (1) that the clerk of the superior court has the sole power in the first instance to determine whether a decedent died testate or intestate, and, if he died testate, whether the paper-writing offered for probate is his will;
                        (2) that proceedings to repeal letters of administration must be commenced before the clerk who issued them in the first instance; and (3) that the judge of the superior court has no jurisdiction to appoint or remove an administrator
                        or a guardian. In other words, jurisdiction in probate matters cannot be exercised by the judge of the superior court except upon appeal. In re Estate of Lowther,

                        Where the clerk removes an administratrix upon his finding that she was not the widow of the deceased and therefore was not entitled to appointment as a matter of right, and an appeal is taken to the superior court from such order, the superior court,
                        even though its jurisdiction is derivative, hears the matter de novo, and may review the finding of the clerk provided the appellant has properly challenged the finding by specific exception, and may hear evidence and even submit
                        the controverted fact to the jury; but where there is no exception to the finding, the superior court may determine only whether the finding is supported by competent evidence, and if the order is so supported the superior court
                        is without authority to vacate the clerk’s judgment and order a jury trial upon the issue. In re Estate of Lowther,

                        G.S. 97-10.2(f)(1) addresses solely the distribution of proceeds of, inter alia, a wrongful death settlement, whereas subdivision (a)(23) of this section controls the manner in which a wrongful death action may be settled by an administrator. There is
                        thus no conflict between the statutes, fairly and properly construed, and each remains effective in its respective area of application. Bowling v. Combs, 60 N.C. App. 234, 298 S.E.2d 754,

                        Although the trial court found that decedent’s wrongful death proceeds were not assets of the estate, the clerk retained authority to oversee the distribution of the proceeds as a result of its power to order an accounting of estate assets, to remove
                        the defendant as the estate’s personal representative, to impose sanctions against her based upon alleged misconduct concerning the proceeds, and to order the proceeds submitted to the clerk or public administrator; although wrongful
                        death actions may not yield assets for the estate, a personal representative’s authority to commence and settle these actions is “incident to the collection, preservation, liquidation [and] distribution of a decedent’s estate.”

                        Superior court properly removed a decedent’s daughter as administratrix of the decedent’s estate for failing to file a final accounting because the appeal was an estate proceeding and, while the court’s order indicated that the court dismissed the daughter’s

                    A successor personal representative is one appointed to succeed a personal representative whose appointment has terminated by death, resignation or revocation. Unless a contrary intent clearly appears from the will, a successor personal representative
                    has all the powers and duties, discretionary or otherwise, of the original personal representative.

                        the defendant as the estate’s personal representative, to impose sanctions against her based upon alleged misconduct concerning the proceeds, and to order the proceeds submitted to the clerk or public administrator; although wrongful
                        death actions may not yield assets for the estate, a personal representative’s authority to commence and settle these actions is “incident to the collection, preservation, liquidation [and] distribution of a decedent’s estate.”

                        Before distribution of the estate, it is the duty of the administrator to pay the debts of the estate, provided such debts are presented within 12 months (now three months) next after publication under this section. As against claims presented after that

                        Contrary to shareholders’ argument, the record was clear that the executrix did not have knowledge of any unsatisfied claim against the testator or the estate, and the shareholders had settled and dismissed an earlier suit against testator without prejudice,
                        and never served a second suit; the shareholders therefore were not entitled to personal notice. In re Estate of Mullins, 182 N.C. App. 667, 643 S.E.2d 599,

                        Husband of a decedent was not entitled to personal notice of the time limitation for filing claims against his wife’s estate under G.S. 28A-14-1(b), because there was no evidence that the executors were on notice of any claims he had against the estate

                        An executor’s general notice to creditors published in a newspaper was fatally defective where it failed to name a day after which claims would be barred and failed to give notice that claims must be filed within six months (now three months) from the
                        day of the first publication of the notice; therefore, the notice to creditors was ineffective to start the running of the statute of limitations of G.S. 28A-19-3(a) in bar of a claim against decedent’s estate to recover for personal

                        Superior court properly entered a judgment for the sister of a decedent and ordered his co-executrixes to pay her the amount of a debt with interest because the decedent’s holographic will made an indirect devise to his sister by directing that his funds
                        were to be used to pay the debt owed by the sister to a third party, the co-executrixes did not mail or deliver a notice of creditors, the rejection of the creditor’s claim filed by the sister and the statute of limitations applicable
                        to such claim did not bar her claim as an heir or devisee to her respective share or interest in the decedent’s estate, and inasmuch as the sister was not a creditor, any statute of limitations applicable to creditors did not apply

                        notice to creditors. Since this section more specifically deals with when a claim may be filed against an estate, this statute controlled, and would bar a cause of action even if the action had been filed within three years of
                        discovery. Liner v. DiCresce, 905 F. Supp. 280, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20710 (M.D.N.C. 1994).

                        For the purpose of the discovery rule delaying the running of a limitation period, a subtle yet distinct difference in meaning between the words “arise” and “accrue” becomes evident: a cause of action for fraud accrues when the fraud is discovered. Because
                        a participant in fraud died more than four years before action was filed, any alleged fraud committed by him must have arisen more than four years earlier, during his lifetime, and the North Carolina non-claim statute barred any
                        claims filed more than six months after final creditor’s notice, though sounding in fraud. Liner v. DiCresce, 905 F. Supp. 280, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20710 (M.D.N.C. 1994).

                        Subsection (d) does not control the title to crops not planted at the time of the death of the testator or devisor. Manifestly, in the forum of common sense, a crop could not be a crop until the seeds were in the soil. The statute uses the expression,
                        “crops . . . remaining ungathered at his death,” etc. An ungathered crop is certainly not an unplanted crop. Carr v. Carr,

                        by his trustees for $22,543.48, and those funds were included in the assets coming into the hands of the executor, and moreover, where there were sufficient assets in the estate to satisfy all of its obligations as well as all
                        general, specific and demonstrative devises without any abatement of those devises, these findings were sufficient to support the court’s conclusion that testator’s specific testamentary gift of his interest in livestock to his

                        Although the trial court found that decedent’s wrongful death proceeds were not assets of the estate, the clerk retained authority to oversee the distribution of the proceeds as a result of its power to order an accounting of estate assets, to remove
                        the defendant as the estate’s personal representative, to impose sanctions against her based upon alleged misconduct concerning the proceeds, and to order the proceeds submitted to the clerk or public administrator; although wrongful
                        death actions may not yield assets for the estate, a personal representative’s authority to commence and settle these actions is “incident to the collection, preservation, liquidation [and] distribution of a decedent’s estate.”

                        A purchaser of personalty from a personal representative does not, by virtue of the latter’s absolute power to dispose of the personalty, have to see to the proper application of the purchase price. This is so although decedent has created a particular
                        separate fund for the payment of his debts. But if the purchase be tainted with collusion, the purchaser will be held responsible for the proper application of the proceeds. Tyrrell v. Morris,

                            When a property owner dies intestate, the title to his real property vests immediately in his heirs. The decedent’s personal representative has the power, upon petition to the clerk of superior court, to sell decedent’s real property for payments of debts
                            and other claims against the decedent’s estate, but the proceeding is an adversary one, requiring that the heirs be made parties. If an heir is not joined, the order of sale is void as to him. Swindell v. Lewis, 82 N.C. App.

                            Deceased died seized of lands lying in two counties, and an administrator, appointed in the county of his residence, instituted proceedings in the other county to sell lands to make assets. The widow appeared therein asking that the lands be sold subject
                            to dower and averring that she would later institute proceedings for the allotment of dower. Upon order of the clerk that the widow’s dower be allotted and that the remaining lands be sold to make assets, a sheriff and jury
                            from that county went into the county of deceased’s residence and allotted dower by metes and bounds. It was held that the allotment was invalid, that the clerk of the other county was without authority to enter the order for
                            the allotment of dower notwithstanding he had jurisdiction of the proceedings to sell lands to make assets, and might have ordered the lands sold subject to dower, and that the only provisions of this section giving the clerk
                            jurisdiction in regard to dower in lands outside his county was where the widow consents that the lands be sold clear of dower and that a certain part of the proceeds of sale be set apart to her in commutation of dower. High

                    <p>
                        When a property owner dies intestate, the title to his real property vests immediately in his heirs. The decedent’s personal representative has the power, upon petition to the clerk of superior court, to sell decedent’s real property for payments of debts
                        and other claims against the decedent’s estate, but the proceeding is an adversary one, requiring that the heirs be made parties. If an heir is not joined, the order of sale is void as to him. Swindell v. Lewis, 82 N.C. App. 423,

                        provision, any judgment which may be rendered in an action against a decedent’s administrator will be wholly ineffectual as against an heir of the decedent, who is not a party to such action, even though such action is predicated

                            Since pending the administration of an estate title to personal property of an intestate vests in his administrator and not his heirs, it necessarily follows that the administrator, and not creditors or heirs, is the proper party to bring an action to
                            collect a debt due the estate or to recover specific personal property. Spivey v. Godfrey,

                            To the general rule that the administrator must bring suit there are certain exceptions. If the administrator has refused to bring the action to collect the assets; if there is collusion between a debtor and a personal representative — particularly if
                            the latter is insolvent; or, if some other peculiar circumstance warrants it, the creditors or heirs may bring the action which the personal representative should have brought. However, in such a case the administrator must
                            be a party defendant. Spivey v. Godfrey,

                            In a proper case, a personal representative may be removed for failure to prosecute or defend actions in behalf of the estate he represents, but clearly a request to sue and a refusal would be conditions precedent. Spivey v. Godfrey,

                            A suit by one of the heirs to collect his share of decedent’s funds in the hands of a third person is no different from a suit by a creditor of the estate to collect a debt due it. In the absence of allegations bringing the suit within one of the exceptions,

                            Trial court properly dismissed a grandfather’s complaint for custody of his maternal grandchild because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to proceed due to a pre-existing child custody action between the child’s paternal grandparents and the child’s
                            now-deceased mother, which did not abate for reasons of constitutional and statutory law and, and, while any relative could seek custody of a child, the grandfather did not file suit against an allegedly unfit parent, and as
                            his complaint was more akin to a request to modify the custody order than it was an initial claim for custody, the proper procedure for the grandfather was to file a motion to intervene and a motion for custody in the grandparents’
                            custody action. Rivera v. Matthews, 263 N.C. App. 652, 824 S.E.2d 164,

                            There is no federal statutory law governing the measure of damages in wrongful death actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and, therefore, 42 U.S.C. § 1988 compels the use of the law of North Carolina: namely, this section. Bowling v. Oldham,

                            Under common law a personal injury to minor child, proximately caused by negligence of another, gave rise to two distinct causes of action: one by the child for damages for the personal injury, and a second by the parent for, inter alia, expenses incurred
                            for necessary medical treatment of the child. However, when the General Assembly legislates in respect to the subject matter of any common-law rule, the statute supplants the common law and becomes the public policy of this
                            State. The General Assembly has provided that damages recoverable for death by wrongful act include, inter alia, expenses for care, treatment and hospitalization incident to the injury resulting in death and the reasonable

                            Cause of action for the wrongful death of the fetus was not subject to dismissal on grounds that it was not brought by the personal representative of the deceased as required by subsection (a), where the failure to bring this action in the name of the
                            administrator of the estate was apparently due to the unwillingness of the clerk of court to issue letters of administration for a fetus’s “estate.” The existence of a cause of action for wrongful death is sufficient for the
                            appointment of an administrator, and since a wrongful death action exists for a viable fetus, the clerk should have appointed an administrator to bring the action. Ledford v. Martin, 87 N.C. App. 279, 359 S.E.2d 505 (1987).

                            In determining whether any wrongful death action is maintainable, the Supreme Court has consistently analyzed the question in terms of whether the deceased, had he lived, would have had a claim against defendant for the injuries inflicted. If so, then
                            the estate of the deceased may maintain an action for wrongful death; if not, then the action for wrongful death will not lie. Carver v. Carver,

                            Although a wrongful death action may be a distinct cause of action from one for negligent infliction of personal injury, the theory or theories of liability and the operative facts from which liability arises are not different. Nelson v. United States,

                            Apart from the measure of damages, recovery for wrongful death in North Carolina depends upon the same proof of actionable negligence or misconduct under the general rules of tort liability which would apply to an action strictly for personal injury.

                            The burden of proving actionable negligence in an action for damages for wrongful death grounded in negligence is, of course, on the party seeking recovery. But if the evidence, that offered by both plaintiff and defendant, construed in the light most
                            favorable to the party with the burden of proof, is sufficient to make out a prima facie case of actionable negligence, a motion for nonsuit should be denied and the case submitted to the jury. Maynor v. Townsend, 2 N.C. App.

                            With the 1985 amendment of subsection (a) of this section, the Legislature has chosen to allow reasonable and necessary expenses, excluding attorneys’ fees, incurred in pursuing a wrongful death action to be paid from the assets of the deceased’s estate.
                            If there is any recovery from the wrongful death action, the recovery must first be applied to reimburse the estate for the expenses paid from its assets in pursuing the action. In re Estate of Proctor, 79 N.C. App. 646, 340

                        <p>
                            Prior to the 1985 amendment to subsection (a) of this section, there was no statutory authority for paying out of a decedent’s estate the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in pursuing a wrongful death action. Thus, on February 1, 1985, clerk
                            properly denied petition seeking authorization of payment of litigation expenses out of decedent’s estate, and superior court was correct in affirming the clerk’s order. However, following the July 5, 1985 amendment there was
                            nothing to prevent decedent’s personal representatives from filing a new petition seeking to have those same expenses paid from the deceased’s estate. In re Estate of Proctor, 79 N.C. App. 646, 340 S.E.2d 138,

                            In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where a widow, who was the decedent’s sole
                            intestate beneficiary, had abandoned the decedent before his death, she was not entitled to a wrongful death recovery, and since the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only received their original
                            percentage, there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., 154 N.C. App. 103, 571 S.E.2d 668,

                            Although an administratrix of a deceased employee who has received compensation for the employee’s death under the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act is thereby barred from prosecuting any other remedy for the injury, she may, under this section,
                            pending the hearing before the Industrial Commission, institute an action against a third person whose negligent acts caused the death of the intestate, and where the insurance carrier has paid the compensation later awarded,
                            it is subrogated to the rights of the employer and may maintain the action against such third person in the name of the administratrix. Phifer v. Berry,

                            Since the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act expressly provides that the subrogated right of action against the third person tort-feasor in favor of the insurance carrier paying compensation for which the employer is liable must be maintained in
                            the name of the injured employee or his personal representative, the act does not change or modify the requirement of this section that an action for wrongful death must be maintained by the administrator of the deceased, and
                            the insurance carrier cannot maintain the action for wrongful death in its own name against the third person tort-feasor. Whitehead &amp; Anderson, Inc. v. Branch,

                            The definition of “viability” intended by the Supreme Court in DiDonato v. Wortman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">
         320 N.C. 423
        </cite> , 358 S.E.2d 489 (1987), is simply the common law definition of fetal capability to live independently of the mother. Although there is apparently no clear medical consensus as to the specific gestational age
                            at which this capability is currently achieved, a gestational range of 20 to 26 weeks has been suggested. However, the determination of a fetus’s viability is a question of fact. Johnson v. Ruark Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology

                            The right of action for wrongful death is limited to such as would, if the injured party had lived, have entitled him to an action for damages therefor. Hence, the administrator of an unemancipated child whose death is caused by the negligence of his
                            parent has no cause of action against the parent for the wrongful death of the child because such child, if he had lived, would have had no cause of action against the parent on account of his injuries. Horney v. Meredith Swimming

                            In receiving funds paid in settlement of a wrongful death claim a personal representative of a decedent’s estate is not acting for the estate but as the trustee for the beneficiaries under the law. In re Below, 12 N.C. App. 657, 184 S.E.2d 378,

                            A personal representative does not derive any right, title, or authority from his intestate, but he sustains more the relation of a trustee in respect to the fund he may recover for the benefit of those entitled eventually to receive it, and he will hold
                            it when recovered actually in that capacity, though in his name as executor or administrator. In re Below, 12 N.C. App. 657, 184 S.E.2d 378,

                            The right of an injured person to sue for personal injuries of any kind is entirely separate and distinct from the right of the personal representative to sue under authority of the wrongful death statute. Any damage sustained by such person during his
                            lifetime is personal to that person and, if proximately caused by the wrongful act of another, could be recovered by him. If this right of action survived his death, the recovery would be an asset of his estate to be administered

                            The proceeds from a federal court action instituted by the decedent’s personal representative were for damages related to his wrongful death, not damages for pain and suffering unrelated to his death, and therefore should have been distributed according
                            to the laws of intestate succession; although the funds were not characterized as wrongful death benefits in the settlement agreement, the federal court record supported such a characterization. In re Estate of Parrish, 143

                            In cases instituted to recover damages for wrongful death, no beneficiary under the statute for whom recovery is sought will be permitted to enrich himself by his own wrong. The right of a person otherwise entitled to receive the money paid for wrongful

                            Intestate was killed in a collision while riding as a passenger in an automobile owned and driven by her son. Intestate’s administrator and the son’s insurer effected a settlement whereby the insurer paid the administrator a sum of money in consideration
                            of the release by the administrator of all claims and demands against the son and the insurer arising out of the accident. There was no finding of fact that the son was negligent, or that he knew of the settlement, and the
                            release stated that all parties released denied liability; however, the son, although he alleged in his answer that he was not negligent and that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the driver of the other automobile
                            did not allege that he had brought suit or made any claim or demand against such driver for damage to his automobile, and offered no evidence at the hearing. It was held that public policy would not permit the son to share

                            Evidence regarding 19 year old decedent’s low level of educational attainment, absence of regular employment, status of dependency on her parents, and history of alcohol and drug abuse was clearly relevant to a determination of her “present monetary value
                            . . . to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered,” and the jury could conclude that these negative factors offset, to the extent found, what decedent’s present monetary value would have been in their absence.

                            Where there is evidence tending to show that persons entitled to receive the damages recovered have a shorter life expectancy than that of deceased, it is error for the court to fail to instruct the jury to consider the life expectancy of such persons

                            should have been admitted on that ground. Hales v. Thompson, 111 N.C. App. 350, 432 S.E.2d 388,

                            Trial judge did not err by instructing the jury that it could award damages to decedent’s parents for the loss of her net income; there is no reason to demand actual support of the parents as the sole ground for any recovery of lost income since such

                        arising out of transfers the wife made to her accounts using a power of attorney, and he failed to file his claim within the time provided by G.S. 28A-19-3(a) following the general newspaper notice to creditors. Mileski v. McConville,

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that a beneficiary’s claim seeking reimbursement for funeral expenses was time-barred because the claim was submitted approximately eight months after the deadline for bringing claims against the estate had elapsed;
                        the determination was within the trial court’s scope of review because it was expressly authorized to determine whether the order of the clerk of court granting reimbursement for the funeral expenses was legally correct. In re

                        Non-claim statute did not apply and thus, could support the trial court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of a mortgagor and the estate of a deceased mortgagor because the mortgagee expressly sought enforcement of the deed of trust, and its claim for

                            Upon the death of an obligor the administration laws step in and determine the settlement of his estate. These have heretofore been construed by the Supreme Court to favor the bankruptcy rule. Thus a secured creditor is required to exhaust his security
                            and then prove his claim for any balance still remaining or unpaid. Rierson v. Hanson,

                            Since the priority of the first class is limited to a situation where the value of the property equals or exceeds the amount of the specific lien thereon, the personal representative may preserve any equity for the benefit of other creditors and of beneficiaries.
                            But where the estate and its creditors and beneficiaries have no right, title or interest in the real property on which the creditor has a specific lien, no equity can be preserved. Underwood v. Ward,

                        <p>
                            The paragraph designated “Fifth class” does not mean that the judgment shall be paid out of the realty of the decedent upon which it has become a lien. When a debtor dies, against whom there is a judgment docketed, his land descends to his heirs or vests
                            in his devisees, and his personal property vests in his administrator or executor, just as if there were no judgment against him, and the whole estate is to be administered just as if there were no judgment, that is to say,
                            the personal property must be sold, if necessary, and all the personal assets collected, and out of these personal assets all the debts must be paid, if there be enough to pay all docketed judgments as well as others. The reason

                        Prohibition embodied in this section is against the representative. Hence, a solvent person in his lifetime may by his will make preferences in favor of persons who would otherwise be postponed. But, as upon his death his effects and property vest in
                        his representative who must pay the debts first, if the estate is insolvent the representative cannot assent to the payment of preferences before the payment of prior debts as prescribed in the preceding section. The result is
                        that preferences made by an insolvent decedent are rendered ineffective for all purposes. Moore v. Byers,

                        An agreement to arbitrate and to award under this section is competent evidence to prove the indebtedness of the estate. Such an agreement is, where there is no fraud or collusion, binding upon the heirs even though they were not parties to the proceedings.

                        The finding of arbitrators under this section is equivalent to a judgment, and the proceedings in which it is rendered can be impeached only for fraud or collusion. Lassiter v. Upchurch,

                        Under a fair interpretation of this section, the award of the referees, unless impeached for fraud and collusion, should have at least the effect of determining and putting an end to the controversy, if not the effect of a judgment in an action between

                        This section applies to creditors’ claims against an estate and not to the interests of heirs. The cases construing this Article involve actions by creditors to recover debts. Moreover, G.S. 28A-19-3(h) expressly provides that the word “claim” as used
                        in this Article “does not apply to claims of heirs or devisees to their respective shares or interests in the decedent’s estate in their capacity as such heirs or devisees.” Poteat v. Robinson, 90 N.C. App. 764, 370 S.E.2d 61,

                        Since, when an estate responded to a former wife’s claim, it stated that the claim was rejected but offered $ 1,000 in settlement of any claim that she may have had, and invited a response or counter-offer, the former wife could have reasonably inferred
                        that negotiations were in order and a discussion might have resulted in allowance and settlement of the claim in some amount; thus, since the estate failed to absolutely and unequivocally reject the claim, the statute of limitations

                        An inventory is but prima facie evidence to charge the executor with assets, so as to call on him for proof to rebut it. Hoover v. Miller,

                        An inventory is prima facie evidence of the solvency of persons owing debts to the estate and described in the inventory. It may be shown that the personal representative made errors in describing and noting the debts. And it seems that the inventory
                        is not evidence against an administrator de bonis non. Grant v. Reese,

                        Where an executor returns an inventory of debts without stating that some of the debts are doubtful, he will be held responsible for them, unless he can show that there were setoffs against them, or that the debtors were insolvent. Graham v. Davidson,

                        This section, which directs that the probate judge (now the clerk) shall “audit” the account, implies that he shall pursue the usual course which has been found to be just and convenient in such cases. Consequently an appeal may not be had from the decision
                        of the probate judge (now the clerk) upon every question collaterally arising in the course of his investigation, in view of the inconveniences incident to such practice peculiar to the common-law action of account, now superseded

                        the defendant as the estate’s personal representative, to impose sanctions against her based upon alleged misconduct concerning the proceeds, and to order the proceeds submitted to the clerk or public administrator; although wrongful
                        death actions may not yield assets for the estate, a personal representative’s authority to commence and settle these actions is “incident to the collection, preservation, liquidation [and] distribution of a decedent’s estate.”

                        Superior court properly removed a decedent’s daughter as administratrix of the decedent’s estate for failing to file a final accounting because the appeal was an estate proceeding and, while the court’s order indicated that the court dismissed the daughter’s
                        case rather than affirming the clerk’s order, the court properly reviewed the clerk’s order consistent with the “on the record” standard. In re Estate of Harper, 269 N.C. App. 213, 837 S.E.2d 602,

        Child Born to Intestate’s Widow More Than 280 Days After His Death. —

                    <p>
                        When it is asserted on behalf of a child born of the woman to whom the intestate was married and with whom he was living at the time of his death that the intestate was her father, the fact that such child was born more than 10 lunar months or 280 days
                        after the intestate’s death, standing alone, does not preclude the child as a matter of law from receiving a child’s share in the distribution of the intestate’s personal estate, absent a statute so providing. Whether such child
                        is the child of intestate is determinable as an issue of fact. Byerly v. Tolbert,
                        <cite class="nc_code">
        250 N.C. 27

                    <p>
                        If, under all relevant circumstances, a child is born more than 10 lunar months or 280 days after the death of the intestate, the presumption is that the child was not en ventre sa mere when the intestate died. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
                        this presumption is determinative but this presumption may be rebutted by evidence tending to show that intestate was in fact the father of the child. Thus, when the issue is raised, the burden of proof rests upon such child to
                        establish by the greater weight of the evidence that the intestate was the father. Byerly v. Tolbert,

                        Before a child can be entitled to a distributive share under the statute of distribution, it must appear that he was either in being or en ventre sa mere at the time of the death of the intestate. Thus a half brother of the intestate born 10 and a half
                        months after her death is not entitled to a distributive share, though born before distribution. Grant v. Bustin,

                    guardian ad litem all such unknown heirs shall be before the court for the purposes of the proceeding to the same extent as if each had been personally served with summons. Any judgment entered by the court in such proceeding shall
                    be as binding upon said unknown heirs as if they were personally before the court and any payment or distribution made by the personal representative under orders of the court shall have the effect of fully discharging such personal
                    representative and any sureties on the personal representative’s official bond to the full extent of such payment or distribution as ordered.

                        Session Laws 2018-40, s. 8.1, which amended subsections (a) and (d) of this section, is located in Part VIII of Session Laws 2018-40. Section 8.2 of that act provides, “This section becomes effective January 1, 2019.” The reference to “This section” in
                        Section 8.2 appears to have been in error and “This Part” was apparently the intended wording. Section 15 of the act provides that except as otherwise provided, the act is effective when it becomes law. Session Laws 2019-243, s.
                        28(a), effective retroactively to January 1, 2019, amended Session Laws 2018-40, s. 8.2, to read: “This Part becomes effective January 1, 2019, and applies to distributions made on or after that date.”

                        The allowance of commissions, by way of compensation, to an executor requires the exercise of judicial discretion and judgment by the clerk of the superior court. It is he who has original jurisdiction. If any interested party conceives that the allowance
                        made by him is either inadequate or excessive, or is made under an erroneous conception of the law, he may appeal. But the Supreme Court, upon review of the compensation allowed, cannot perform the function of the clerk, for it

                        The terms “receipts” and “expenditures,” as used in this section, refer to the actual receipts and the actual expenditures of the personal representative. An administrator has no lawful claim to commissions on the credits or offsets deducted by a consent
                        judgment from the indebtedness of his testate. This is so for the reason that the deductions were neither actually received nor actually expended by the administrator. In re Ledbetter,

                        Trial court erred in ruling that the clerk of court lacked the authority to review an executor’s attorneys’ fees petition for reasonableness; clerks do possess the authority to review attorneys’ fees petitions for reasonableness pursuant to their power
                        to allow reasonable sums for necessary charges and disbursements incurred in the management of an estate. In re Taylor, 242 N.C. App. 30, 774 S.E.2d 863,

                        The existence of a valid claim against an estate which is not time-barred may, in an appropriate case, constitute “proper cause” to reopen a closed estate in order to assert the claim. However, claims which are already barred may not be asserted in a

                        Order of contempt and commitment entered against plaintiff-executor for failure to file account on estate and to appear and show cause was a valid court order pursuant to this section. In contesting this court order, plaintiff’s proper course of action
                        would have been to appeal the order itself. Instead, plaintiff attacked the order by seeking declaratory relief and the expunction of his records in a wholly separate action. The trial court had no authority to grant plaintiff
                        the relief sought in that it had no power collaterally to vacate the order of contempt and commitment. Therefore, the trial court’s dismissal of plaintiff’s claim under Rules 12(b)(1) and (6) was proper. Little v. Bennington, 109

                        whether such appointment occurred before or after the issue of ancillary letters, the clerk of superior court shall notify the domiciliary personal representative, by registered mail, of the action taken by the clerk of superior
                        court and the state of the ancillary administration. Such notice shall include a statement that at any time prior to approval of the ancillary personal representative’s final account the domiciliary personal representative may
                        appear in the proceedings for any purpose the domiciliary personal representative may deem advisable; and that the domiciliary personal representative may apply to be substituted as ancillary personal representative, but that such
                        request will not be granted unless the clerk of superior court finds that such action will be for the best interests of North Carolina administration of the estate.

                        This section does not mean that a claim filed by a foreign personal representative who has not yet locally qualified is a nullity ab initio requiring the institution of a new claim after qualification. At most, it is simply another way of saying that
                        the foreign administrator must qualify locally before he has capacity to sue in North Carolina. Burcl v. North Carolina Baptist Hosp.,

                <p>
                    When a decedent dies testate or intestate leaving a surviving spouse as the sole devisee or heir, the surviving spouse may file a petition for summary administration with the clerk of superior court of the county where the decedent was domiciled at the
                    time of death. This procedure is available if the decedent died partially testate, provided that the surviving spouse is the sole devisee under the will and the sole heir of the decedent’s intestate property. This procedure is not
                    available if the decedent’s will provides that it is not available or if the devise to the surviving spouse is in trust rather than outright.
