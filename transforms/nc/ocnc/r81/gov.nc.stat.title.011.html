       The “solemnity” applies not only to the substance of the oath,

        Double Sanction to Oath of Witness. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The law requires two guarantees of the truth of what a witness is about to state; he must be in the fear of punishment by the laws of man, and he must also be in the fear of punishment by the laws of God, if he states what is false; in other words, there must be a temporal and also a religious sanction to his oath.

        Sufficiency of Belief. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A person who believes in the obligation of an oath on the Bible; who believes in God and Jesus Christ, and that God will punish in this world, all violators of his law, and that the sinner will inevitably be punished in this world for each and every sin committed; but who believes that there will be no punishment after death, and that in another world all will be happy and equal to the angels, is competent to be sworn. Shaw v. Moore,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        49 N.C. 25
       </cite>
       , 1856

      <p>
       In Omychund v. Barker, 1 Atk. 19, and Wiles, 538, it was decided that a Gentoo, who did not believe in either the Old or New Testament, but who believed in a God, as the Creator of the Universe, and believed that he was a rewarder of those who do well, and an avenger of those who do ill, according to the common law, could be sworn in that form which was the most sacred and obligatory upon his religious sense. The case established the rule to be, that an infidel is competent to be sworn, provided he believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, who punishes the wicked, without reference to the time of punishment.

       Where a juror was sworn in the presence of the defendant, and his counsel let him acquiesce in the manner in which the oath was taken, to permit him to object after the verdict would simply make a trial not a decision upon the merits but a series of pitfalls for the State. Not having spoken when he was called upon to speak, the prisoner would not be heard after the verdict has gone against him. State v. Ward,

      I, A.B., do appeal to God, as a witness of the truth and the avenger of falsehood, as I shall answer the same at the great day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be known (etc., as the words of the oath may be).
