     Official Commentary
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p>
    This Chapter replaces Chapter 5 of the North Carolina General Statutes. The Commission deals with the full range of contempt, both criminal and civil, for two reasons. First, criminal contempt is clearly within the subject matter which the Commission was charged to study, and many aspects of civil contempt are necessary to the enforcement of orders in criminal cases. Second, once the Commission began to deal with criminal contempt, it became necessary also to deal with civil contempt since the two are inextricably bound together in Chapter 5. The provisions in Chapter 5A are not directly drawn from any other statute, but they are drafted in light of Chapter 5 and of the American Bar Association’s standards on the function of the trial judge. This Chapter does not carry forward the provisions of Chapter 5 which grant contempt powers to boards of county commissioners and the Utilities and Industrial Commissions. The application of those powers was sufficiently unclear under Chapter 5 that the Commission thought it best that those bodies either initiate statutes specifically dealing with that authority or that those bodies rely on court orders or criminal statutes dealing with the disruption of meetings.

     The establishment of this Article represents one of the basic purposes of the Commission in drafting the Chapter on contempt — to draw a sharp distinction between proceedings for criminal contempt and the proceedings for civil contempt (or “as for contempt”). This Article deals with those matters for which a sanction is imposed purely as punishment. The sanction occurs without regard to what the contemnor will do after imposition of the sanction.

       This section is based on Section 5-1. Generally this section merely compresses the existing statement of grounds for criminal contempt, including the consolidation of previously separate grounds. Under subdivision (4), refusal to answer a question when that answer is privileged would not be contempt since the refusal would be “legally justified.” Subdivision (5) adds the clause “made with knowledge that it was false . . .” thus engrafting the standard of New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), onto cases of alleged contempt in publishing reports of proceedings. Subdivision (7) does not have a counterpart in Chapter 5; it was added to make clear, for example, that the failure to appear in court at the proper time by one, including counsel, whose nonappearance would interfere with the court’s schedule, could be subject to criminal contempt. Subdivision (9) is new and gives the court authority to step in immediately in cases of improper communication with jury. It is intended to complement the provision of a new

       , enlarging the Chapter 14 provisions dealing with jury tampering. The provisions of

        <a href="#t5Aa01s5A-12ol1e" target="_self">
         G.S. 5A-12(e)
        </a>
       </cite>
       dictate the relationship between the two sanctions for jury tampering. Subdivision (10) is also new and is intended to insure that this Chapter does not reject attempts elsewhere in the General Statutes to make certain acts criminal contempt. The final sentences of this section are intended to effect the same purpose as the final two sentences of
       <cite class="ocnc">
        <a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html#t05s5-1" target="_blank">
         G.S. 5-1
        </a>
       </cite>
       . Subsection (b) supplements or clarifies G.S. 5A-11(a)(4) by prohibiting as punishment as contempt for a communication which does not pose a “clear and present danger” to justice. Subsection (c) operates as a reminder of the existence of another new provision,
       <cite class="ocnc">
        <a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va22As7A-276.1" target="_blank">

        </a>
       </cite>
       , which prohibits “gag orders” of reports of open-court proceedings or of records required to be open to public inspection. Especially important is the final sentence of the section making such an order void, thus overcoming the usual rule that a person subject to an order must comply with that order, even though it may be illegal, until a higher court declares its illegality.

        Proceedings for contempt are of two classes, criminal and civil. Criminal proceedings are those brought to preserve the power and to vindicate the dignity of the court and to punish for disobedience of its processes or orders. Civil proceedings are those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of the parties to actions and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of the suitors. Galyon v.

        Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties.

        Contempt proceedings are of two classes: those brought to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court; and those brought to enforce the rights of private parties. The former are as a rule held criminal in their nature and are generally governed by the rules applicable to criminal cases. North Carolina v. Carr, 264 F. Supp. 75, 1967 U.S. Dist.

        Criminal proceedings, involving as they do offenses against the courts and organized society, are punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. Whereas civil proceedings, having as their underlying purpose the preservation of private rights, are primarily remedial and coercive in their nature, and are usually prosecuted at the instance of an aggrieved suitor.

        Criminal contempt is the commission of an act tending to interfere with the administration of justice, while civil contempt is the remedy for the enforcement of orders in the equity jurisdiction of the court, and the willful refusal to pay alimony as ordered by the court is civil contempt.

        A major factor in determining whether contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. O'Briant v. O'Briant,

        Where disobedience to process or order is due to circumstances which make it impossible for the contemnor to obey such order or process, he may not be punished for contempt. Thus where the clerk issued a notice to the respondent to produce a certain will which was in the custody of some other clerk, it was held that the order to adjudge the respondent guilty of contempt was reversible on appeal.

        Defendant was not subjected to an improper burden of proof under G.S. 5A-15(f) in finding that defendant was in criminal contempt under G.S. 5A-11(a)(3), as defendant admitted that defendant was ordered to stay out of the judges’ offices and that defendant entered an area of the courthouse marked “Judges Offices” to file an emergency motion with the trial court administrator; there was no issue of fact to be decided, and thus no burden of proof was placed on defendant, as the trial court properly required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant’s contempt of court.

        Conduct proscribed by the felony secret peeping statute constitutes a “sexual offense,” and subject to the express limitation that a defendant’s actions are for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of any person; therefore, defendant was in indirect criminal contempt of a custody consent order because she willfully allowed her children in the presence of her boyfriend, who was a “convicted sex offender” as provided in the order based on his conviction for felony secret peeping, even if he was not required to register as a sex offender. The record showed that the inclusion of the “convicted sex offender” language in the consent order was specifically targeted at defendant’s relationship with her boyfriend. State v. Mastor, 243 N.C.

         Refusal to Testify After Having Been Sworn. —

       <p>
        It has been uniformly held by the Supreme Court and by courts of other jurisdictions that the power to punish for contempt committed in the presence of the court is inherent in the court, and not dependent upon statutory authority. Without such power the court cannot perform its judicial function. This principle is especially applicable when the contempt consists in the refusal of the witness in attendance upon the court, after having been duly sworn, to answer a question propounded to him for the purpose of eliciting evidence material to the issue to be decided by the court.

       Subsection (b) is drawn from the recommendations of the American Bar Association. It intends to preclude fine or punishment in response to what is essentially innocent conduct although censure alone would still be possible. Subsection (c) makes clear that a judge may change his mind and reduce or remove any punishment he imposed in response to contempt. Subsection (d) makes clear that, although civil contempt and criminal contempt proceedings are distinct, each may be imposed for the same conduct.

        Punishment for Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal contempt is administered as punishment for acts already committed that have impeded the administration of justice in some way. And as is the case with all offenses of a criminal nature, the punishment that courts can impose therefor, either by fine or imprisonment, is circumscribed by law. Civil contempt, on the other hand, is employed to coerce disobedient defendants into complying with orders of court, and the length of time that a defendant can be imprisoned in a proper case is not limited by law, since the defendant can obtain his release immediately upon complying with the court’s order. Brower v. Brower, 70 N.C. App. 131, 318 S.E.2d 542,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        1984 N.C. App. LEXIS 3622
       </cite>
       (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A major factor in determining whether contempt is criminal or civil is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. The importance in distinguishing criminal and civil contempt lies in the difference in procedure, punishment and right of review. Bishop v. Bishop, 90 N.C. App. 499, 369 S.E.2d 106,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       Contempt may be of two kinds, civil or criminal, although the demarcation between the two may be hazy at best. Criminal contempt is generally applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve the rights of private parties and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Bishop v. Bishop, 90 N.C. App. 499, 369 S.E.2d 106,

       Where the court finds that a defendant is in civil contempt, it is not limited by this section to imposing a 30-day sentence for criminal contempt. It can, under G.S. 5A-21(b), order his imprisonment until he purges himself of contempt. Bennett v. Bennett, 71 N.C. App. 424, 322 S.E.2d 439,

       This section specifies that only direct criminal contempt may be the subject of summary proceedings and defines direct criminal contempt. The three factors listed in subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3) must all be present before an act can be direct contempt. Subsection (a) also permits the judge who is authorized to punish summarily to defer the proceedings if he choose. The last sentence of subsection (a) establishes the rule that a person be cited for contempt at the time the contempt occurs even if the proceedings are to be held later.

       Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing is required.

       If the contempt proceedings are to be summary, subsection (a) requires that they occur substantially at the same time as the contempt itself. Subsection (b) follows the American Bar Association recommendation that the person charged with contempt be given notice of what the contemptuous action was and an opportunity to respond. This was intended not to provide for a hearing, or anything approaching that, in summary contempt proceedings, but merely to assure that the alleged contemnor had an opportunity to point out instances of gross mistake about who committed the contemptuous act or matters of that sort.

       The term “substantially contemporaneously with the contempt”
       
       in subsection (a) of this section is construed in light of its legislative purpose of meeting due process safeguards. The word “substantially” qualifies the word “contemporaneously,” and clearly does not require that the contempt proceedings immediately follow the misconduct.

       It was error to hold defendant in criminal contempt in a summary proceeding because he was statutorily entitled to an opportunity to respond, but the court struck language in the court’s form order indicating defendant was given such an opportunity, so the criminal contempt order was facially deficient, and a criminal contempt judgment entered upon that order was likewise deficient.

       In an appeal from a contempt judgment, the trial court erred by failing to give defendant summary notice and an opportunity to be heard before entering judgment, as the findings and order signed by the trial court contained a pre-printed finding that the contemnor was given summary notice of the charges and summary opportunity to respond but the record directly contradicted the form language, showing instead that judgment and sentence were imposed without notice and no opportunity to be heard was given.

       This section provides for a show-cause hearing in instances in which the judge either chooses not to proceed by summary proceedings or may not so proceed because the contempt was not direct. Plenary proceedings may not be held by a magistrate or clerk; they must always be held before a judge. The final sentence of subsection (a) responds to the constitutional requirement of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968), that contempt proceedings be held before another judge when the one citing the contemnor was involved in the act in question. Subsection (f) permits the judge, in addition to using the prosecutor, who traditionally represents the court in contempt actions, to appoint another member of the Bar when there is a conflict of interest. The central example of this would be when the prosecutor himself or a law-enforcement officer with whom he worked closely was involved in the contempt.

Subsection (a) clarifies the legality of seizing a person charged with direct contempt and bringing him before the judge. Subsection (b) makes clear the propriety of issuing an order for arrest of a person when the proceedings are not to be summary. A concurrent change in

       This section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the superior court to hear appeals from orders in the district court holding a person in criminal contempt. Michael v. Michael, 77 N.C. App. 841, 336 S.E.2d 414,

       Criminal contempt orders are properly appealed from district court to the superior court, not to the Court of Appeals. Hancock v. Hancock, 122 N.C. App. 518, 471 S.E.2d 415,

       Because neither the appellant, nor the appellant’s trial counsel challenged the decision of the trial court judge, either at the end of a recusal hearing or in the appellant’s notice of appeal, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the appellant’s arguments.

     The Commission felt that it was proper, once they had to deal with civil contempt in some respect as a consequence of severing it in Chapter 5 from the related criminal contempt provisions, to resolve some of the uncertainties that surround the present civil contempt procedures.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section is based on the Commission’s recognition that civil contempt should be solely a matter of forcing the contemnor to comply with a court order and, unlike criminal contempt, is not a form of punishment. Subsections (a) and (b) make clear that civil contempt is appropriate only so long as the court order is capable of being complied with. The section rejects the approach of the present Chapter 5 specifying particular grounds for civil contempt. Instead, the only issue in determining whether imprisonment for civil contempt is proper is whether or not there is a court order which may be complied with. Subdivision (3) of subsection (a), by specifying that the contempt continues while the person is “able to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply,” is intended to make clear, for example, that the person who does not have the money to make court-ordered payments but who could take a job which would enable him to make those payments, remains in contempt by not taking such a job. In most cases, a person in civil contempt may be held for so long as his civil contempt continues; he holds the keys to his own jail by virtue of his ability to comply. The Commission felt, however, in the case of failure to comply with nontestimonial identification order by one who is only suspected of a crime, that this unlimited jailing would be improper. Therefore, unless probable cause for arrest arises, the person subject to a nontestimonial identification order who remains noncompliant must be released after 90 days. Concurrent amendments to

        </a>
       </cite>
       (the section dealing with nontestimonial identification orders) point out that resisting compliance with a nontestimonial identification order may be used in determining whether there is probable cause that the person subject to the order committed the crime in question. This means that in many cases the person who resists the order for the full 90 day period will become subject to arrest on probable cause, at which time the 90 day limitation will no longer apply. Another concurrent amendment to

        <a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa14s15A-279" target="_blank">

        </a>
       </cite>
       provides, however, that a nontestimonial identification order may not be reissued unless there is newly available evidence to support it. In subsection (c), the Commission was seeking to insure that a person could not serve a longer period of imprisonment by being found in both civil and criminal contempt for the same conduct than he could if he had been found to be in only civil or criminal contempt. An earlier draft of this subsection had specified that a finding of civil or criminal contempt did not preclude disciplinary proceedings if the contemnor were a member of the Bar. The Commission approved this policy but felt it more appropriate that it be mentioned in commentary rather than in the body of the section.

        Acts and omissions constituting civil contempt involve matters tending to defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of a party to an action pending in court, and are punishable with the underlying purpose of preserving private rights by coercion. Galyon v. Stutts,

        When the trial court ordered defendant to either pay plaintiff $400 or serve thirty days in jail for willfully refusing to pay postseparation support to plaintiff, the action was for defendant’s failure to comply with the trial court’s previous order, and it was evident that the trial court was exercising its contempt power to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order. Therefore, this was a contempt order, and it was civil contempt. Thompson v. Thompson, 223 N.C. App. 515, 735 S.E.2d 214,

        The line of demarcation between civil and criminal contempts is hazy at best. A major factor in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the primary purpose is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders, the contempt is criminal. Where the primary purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers,

        Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties.

        Civil contempt is based upon acts or neglect constituting a willful violation of a lawful order of the court. A failure to obey an order of the court cannot be punished by attachment for civil contempt unless the disobedience is willful.

        Since defendants were already serving an indefinite, conditional prison sentence for civil contempt at the time their motions for release from conditional incarceration were filed, the trial court was not adjudicating an initial or continuing contempt and thus, had no inherent statutory obligation to consider any of subsection (a)’s enumerations; rather, the issue for the trial court was whether defendants satisfied their burden of showing they were subject to release.

        A defendant in a nonsupport civil contempt proceeding can be imprisoned only if he has willfully violated the court order and has the present ability to make the payments. He can regain his liberty by doing that which the court has ordered him to do and he has the ability to do, i.e., make the payments. This is consistent with the notion that civil contempt is not criminal punishment, but a civil remedy to be utilized exclusively to enforce compliance with court orders. Hodges v. Hodges, 64 N.C.

        Trial court’s finding that the mother’s actions, suspending the father’s visitation over his objection and without court authority, did not amount to contempt was upheld, as there was evidence that the mother’s failure to comply with the visitation order was justified after the father physically discipline a child in an inappropriate way, the children were visibly shaken and upset by the incident, and there had been past allegations of domestic violence involving the father.

        When parties’ consent order provided that a wife was to assume financial responsibility for credit card debt, and the wife had the present means and ability to comply, it was not error for the trial court to hold defendant in contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with the consent order as it related to the credit card accounts, and to order the wife to pay off the debt as a condition of purging herself of contempt as required by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2).

        In the trial court’s order failing to hold the father in civil contempt over the parties’ visitation agreement, the court held that the trial court properly considered the 15-year-old daughter’s best interests and the current circumstances in evaluating whether the father was in willful civil contempt for not forcing her to visit the mother. The record showed that the daughter was depressed and self-harming, both she and her older brother refused to return to the mother’s home, and the daughter testified that she was more depressed and anxious at the mother’s home.

       Subsection (a) permits the one who has custody of a jailed contemnor to release him without a court order or any formal proceedings, if the custodian finds that the contemnor has purged himself of the contempt by complying with the contempt order’s specifications. This is intended to apply mainly to the situation in which compliance with the order calls for payment to the court. It was felt that this action was so clear that the custodian should be able to proceed on his own. The possibility that a person will be released when a release was not proper was outweighed by the importance of seeing to it that a person did not remain jailed longer than was necessary. Subsection (b) establishes the machinery for a civil contemnor to seek his own release if he has complied or if compliance is no longer possible, but he has still not been released.

       A condition of a temporary child custody order was impermissibly vague, where a condition to be met for the mother to purge herself of civil contempt was that she not punish either of the minor children in any manner that was “stressful, abusive, or detrimental” to the child.

       Order finding a husband’s non-compliance with purge conditions was vacated because (1) the husband could not comply with the conditions in a written order, (2) the order was impermissibly vague as the order’s conditions had no end date, and, (3) despite the husband’s compliance with a condition to reduce tax withholding, a condition requiring the husband to consult with a tax professional to reduce withholdings to the maximum extent possible was wrongly added.

       Subsection (a) draws a distinction between an order to appear for a show of cause hearing and a notice that the show-cause hearing will be held. The Commission wanted to make clear the propriety of a person’s not appearing if he was notified of the show-cause hearing rather than ordered to appear at it. Since the Commission felt that there were some instances in which the court would want the contemnor present regardless of his wishes, the order was left as an option. Application of subsection (b) results in magistrates and clerks being unable to hold proceedings for civil contempt. The Commission particularly intended “a person with an interest” under subsection (f) to include the State, as represented by the district attorney, in a criminal case. Subsection (g) permits, in essence, consolidated hearings for civil and criminal contempt, thus permitting a judge who has begun a civil contempt hearing to continue and find the person in criminal contempt even though he is beyond the reach of civil contempt because of inability at that time to comply with the order.

       The statutes governing proceedings for civil contempt in child support cases clearly assign the burden of proof to the party alleged to be delinquent, and after a civil contempt proceeding is initiated by an interested party who files a motion in the cause, the opposing party must then show cause why he should not be found in contempt.

       The trial court properly found that defendant was sufficiently able to comply with the temporary alimony order but willfully, deliberately, and without justification failed to do so where the defendant failed to meet his burden of proof of establishing that he lacked the means to pay or that his failure to pay was not willful; the defendant failed to provide a financial statement or personal bank statements, failed to give his accountant accurate information, failed to explain large sums of money he received from his girlfriend, and was generally vague or indifferent as to supplemental income he did or could receive.

       When parties’ consent order provided that a wife was to assume financial responsibility for credit card debt, and the wife had the present means and ability to comply, it was not error for the trial court to hold defendant in contempt of court pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a)(1) for failing to comply with the consent order as it related to the credit card accounts, and to order the wife to pay off the debt as a condition of purging herself of contempt as required by G.S. 5A-21(a)(2). When the wife refused to execute forms requested by the Internal Revenue Service in order to file amended tax returns, as required under the parties’ consent order, it was not error for the court to order defendant to sign these form.

       Where order allowed mother to purge the contempt by delivering the child over to the father for his scheduled visitation and by turning over the father’s property or otherwise consenting to a search of her home, the contempt order was actually civil in nature.

A copy of the order shall be furnished to the juvenile and to the juvenile’s attorney.
