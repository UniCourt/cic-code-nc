    Session Laws 1987, c. 850, s. 26, had provided for withdrawal of North Carolina from the Compact unless every party state to the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact) had enacted legislation to amend the Compact Law in force in that state in substantially the manner set out in s. 25 of the act by December 31, 1988, and unless the Congress of the United States had amended the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-240, 99 Stat. 1842 (1986), so as to consent to the amendments to the Compact required to be made by s. 26 on or before December 31, 1992. Section 26 of c. 850 had also provided that the North Carolina Compact Commissioners would certify to the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State that the requirements of the section had or had not been met, and that in the event that the party states to the Compact had not enacted legislation to amend the Compact as required by the section by December 31, 1988, Chapter 104F of the General Statutes would be repealed as of that date, and in the event that the Congress had not amended the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act so as to consent to the amendments required to be made by the section by December 31, 1992, Chapter 104F of the General Statutes would be repealed as of that date.
