       Session Laws 2020-59, ss. 1-4, effective June 30, 2020, provides: “SECTION 1. For purposes of this section, the following shall apply:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) The term ‘Rail Corridor’ shall mean the former Murphy Branch rail corridor consisting of the only railway located solely within the boundaries of Cherokee County and between the Town of Andrews and the Town of Murphy in Cherokee County between Milepost 101.1 and Milepost 113.7, excluding all of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “a. Any portion of that railway located in the Town of Murphy on land owned by the United States government or any of its agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       “b. Any privately owned railroad or any privately owned railroad right-of-way.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Where there is more than one track in the Rail Corridor, the State shall retain its property interest in the Rail Corridor for a distance of 25 feet from the center of each track.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2.(a) Subject to applicable federal requirements, the State’s interest in the right-of-way claimed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation with respect to the Rail Corridor is uniformly reduced to 25 feet on each side of the center line of the tracks traversing the Rail Corridor. Upon reduction of the right-of-way, the interest in real property previously held by the State of North Carolina is transferred to the current adjacent real property owner of record according to the land records in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Cherokee County upon that real property owner’s release of all claims against the State and the Department of Transportation with respect to that right-of-way. All transfers of interest in real property by the State of North Carolina and all releases of claims against the State and the North Carolina Department of Transportation by the owners of adjacent real property must occur within two years of the effective date of this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) Within 180 days of the current adjacent property owner releasing all claims against the State and the Department of Transportation, the Department of Transportation shall, at no expense to the State or to that Department, provide to that real property owner a quitclaim deed, or, if applicable, a deed of release, to the real property so transferred. The quitclaim deed or deed of release shall be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Cherokee County.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapters 136 and 146 of the General Statutes or any other provision of State law, transfers in accordance with this section shall not require Council of State or Board of Transportation approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 3. Notwithstanding Section 2 of this act, the Department of Transportation shall retain an easement for right of entry and access for maintenance and repair of the track and associated structures that is parallel to each side of the retained portion of the Rail Corridor and 15 feet in width. No buildings or structures shall be constructed or placed within this easement nor shall trees or other permanent foliage be allowed to grow within the easement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the maintenance and repair easement established by this section from also being subject to an agricultural or conservation easement under State or federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 4. Nothing in this act shall apply, nor be construed to apply, to any publicly owned or privately owned rail or other transportation corridor, except the Rail Corridor. Nothing in this act shall alter or amend, nor be construed to alter or amend, the application of the federal law with respect to railroad rights-of-way; publicly owned and privately owned rail transportation corridors are and shall remain under the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, the independent federal agency charged with regulation of various modes of surface transportation. Nothing in this act shall alter or amend, nor be construed to alter or amend, that privately owned rail transportation corridor rights-of-way in this State are managed by the respective privately owned railroad.”

     <p>
      Prior to any action of the Board on a transportation project, the Department shall inform all municipalities, counties, and utility providers affected by a planned transportation project and request each to submit within 45 days a written resolution expressing their views on the project. A municipality or county may designate a Transportation Advisory Committee to submit its response to the Department’s request for a resolution. Upon receipt of a written resolution from all affected parties or their designees, or the expiration of the 45-day period, whichever occurs first, the Board may take action. The Department and the Board shall consider, but shall not be bound by, the views of the affected parties or their designees on each transportation project. The failure of an affected party to express its views within the time provided shall not prevent the Department or the Board from taking action. The Department shall not be required to send notice under this section if it has already received a written resolution from the affected party on the planned transportation project. “Action of the Board”, as used in this section, means approval by the Board of: the Transportation Improvement Program and amendments to the Transportation Improvement Program; the Secondary Roads Paving Program and amendments to the Secondary Roads Paving Program; and individual applications for access and public service road projects, contingency projects, small urban projects, and spot safety projects that exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). The 45-day notification provision may be waived upon a finding by the Secretary of Transportation that emergency action is required. Such findings must be reported to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee.

       Intent. —  It is the intent of the General Assembly to take all steps necessary to assist the Department of Transportation in accelerating project delivery and reducing costs incurred by the State. The General Assembly finds that shifting more control over projects to each of the Highway Divisions can assist in achieving this intent. Further, the General Assembly encourages each Highway Division to increase its outsourcing of preconstruction activities to private contractors to sixty percent (60%) of the total cost of preconstruction activities performed by the Highway Division, with the belief that increased outsourcing will also assist in achieving this intent. Therefore, in order to assess the results from shifting project control and increasing the use of outsourcing, and to determine what adjustments may be necessary to improve upon the results, the General Assembly finds that reports are necessary to collect baseline data to establish appropriate targets.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a01s136-12.3ol1b">
       Outsourcing Report. —  For each Highway Division, the Department shall provide a detailed report on all payments made to private contractors for preconstruction activities. In order to compare internal costs incurred with payments made to private contractors, and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Department shall include project-specific expenses incurred by division, regional, or central staff. The Department shall not include expenses incurred for central business units that support and oversee outsourcing functions. The information in the first report submitted under this subsection shall be used to establish a baseline to use for setting future preconstruction outsourcing targets. The Department shall submit the report required under this subsection to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee by March 1 of each year.

      <p>
       Session Laws 1999-237, s. 27.3, provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board of Transportation may award up to three contracts annually for construction of transportation projects on a design-build basis after a determination by the Department that delivery of the projects must be expedited and that it is not in the public interest to comply with normal design and construction contracting procedures. Prior to the award of a design-build contract, the Secretary of Transportation is to report to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee and to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations on the nature and scope of the project and the reasons an award on a design-build basis will best serve the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 1999-237, s. 1.1, provides: “This act shall be known as the ‘Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 1999’.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 1999-237, s. 30.2, provides: “Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 1999-2001 fiscal biennium, the textual provisions of this act apply only to funds appropriated for, and activities occurring during, the 1999-2001 biennium.”

        General Assembly’s delegation of power to the North Carolina Department of Transportation constituted a constitutional delegation of power because there were adequate guiding standards and procedural safeguards in place to regulate the exercise of authority for a project; a limited liability company had to report to the Turnpike Authority Board prior to any increase in toll rates or change in the toll setting methodology from the previous rates or methodology last reported.

        The effect of this section is to give dominance to the easement acquired by the State. Under the terms thereof the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has authority to control the uses to which the land embraced within the easement may be put. If it deems it wise or expedient so to do in the interest of the traveling public, it may altogether exclude the imposition of any additional easement or burden. It may not be held that the legislature intended thereby to declare that the construction and maintenance of a telephone line is a legitimate highway purpose and embraced within the easement acquired for highway use. The Commission (now Department) is merely authorized to do whatever is necessary to be done in order to make a safe, convenient, public way for travel, including the right, if necessary, to exclude the owner and others from using any part of the surface of the way for any permanent or private purpose.

        The Driveway Permit Statute, G.S. 136-18(29), specifically and unambiguously provides an exclusive list of how DOT may regulate driveway connections, as well as an exclusive list of improvements it may require of an applicant. Because the Driveway Permit Statute treats an owner’s access to the state highway system in specific terms, and because it is clear and unambiguous, courts are not permitted to engage in statutory construction. The statute authorized no requirement to make improvements away from the applicant’s property, and it similarly failed to empower DOT to require an applicant to obtain another property owner’s approval, giving that property owner veto power over the applicant’s project. DOT acted in excess of its statutory authority when it conditioned the developer’s driveway permit on widening a railroad crossing one-quarter of a mile away from the driveway connection and on the developer’s obtaining consent from two railroad companies.

        Trial court did not err in concluding the action of the North Carolina Department of Transportation in closing a road that abutted an owner’s property was a lawful exercise of police power and, thus, not a compensable taking, because the owner had reasonable means of ingress and egress from the road to the property.

        North Carolina Department of Transportation’s (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as (1) the case had progressed past the point where sovereign immunity could be asserted, (2) sovereign immunity did not bar suit when the state exercised the state’s eminent domain power, (3) NCDOT was judicially estopped from denying prior admissions to recording a map placing restrictions on property owners’ land, and (4) separation of powers did not bar ordering NCDOT’s deposits for estimated compensation.

         Responsiveness. —  The Department shall structure the Program to gather citizen input and shall commit to quickly addressing structural problems and other road hazards on State-maintained roads. Citizens may report potholes, drainage issues, culvert blockages, guardrail repairs, damaged or missing signs, malfunctioning traffic lights, highway debris, or shoulder damage to the Department of Transportation by calling a toll-free telephone number designated by the Department or submitting an online work request through a Web site link designated by the Department. Beginning January 1, 2016, upon receiving a citizen report in accordance with this subdivision, the Department shall either address the reported problem or identify a solution to the reported problem. Excluding potholes, which shall be repaired within two business days of the date the report is received, the Department of Transportation shall properly address (i) safety-related citizen reports no later than 10 business days after the date the report is received and (ii) non-safety-related citizen reports no later than 15 business days after the date the report is received. The Department shall determine, in its discretion, whether a citizen report is safety-related or non-safety-related. The Department shall transmit information received about potholes or other problems on roads not maintained by the State to the appropriate locality within two business days of receiving the citizen report.

By December 1, 2015, the Department shall establish a baseline unit pricing structure for transportation goods used in highway maintenance and construction projects and set annual targets for three years based on its unit pricing. In forming the baseline unit prices and future targets, the Department shall collect data from each Highway Division on its expenditures on transportation goods during the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2016, no Highway Division shall exceed a ten percent (10%) variance over a baseline unit price set for that year in accordance with this subdivision. The Department of Transportation shall institute annual tracking to monitor pricing variances. The ten percent (10%) maximum variance set under this subdivision is intended to account for regional differences requiring varying product mixes. If a Highway Division exceeds the unit pricing threshold, the Department shall submit a report to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee, the Fiscal Research Division of the General Assembly, the chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Transportation, and the chairs of the Senate Appropriations Committee on the Department of Transportation no later than the fifteenth day of February following the end of the calendar year on why the variance occurred and what steps are being taken to bring the Highway Division back into compliance. In order to drive savings, unit pricing may be reduced annually as efficiencies are achieved.

       “(c) Oversight. — No later than May 1, 2016, and to increase budget transparency and allow for greater legislative and citizen oversight, the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Fiscal Research Division and the Office of State Budget and Management, shall reclassify the funding source for all full-time positions that are budgeted as receipt-supported on the basis of charging to projects to appropriation and shall adjust budgeted funds accordingly. Employees in the Division of Highways shall be attributed to the respective Highway Division fund codes within the Highway Fund. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to reallocate sufficient funds from the Primary Maintenance, Secondary Maintenance, and General Maintenance Reserve fund codes to each Highway Division to pay for salary and related costs associated with the reclassified positions. Receipt-supported positions in other organizational units within the Department of Transportation shall be funded through existing fund codes and funding sources for their assigned organizational units.

The plan shall describe the functions performed at the centrally and regionally based offices, including justification as to why each function cannot be outsourced, consolidated, or shifted to the Highway Divisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) Recommendations on performance- or incentive-based systems to improve the effectiveness of the Division of Highways.

      </p>
      <p>
       The preamble to Session Laws 2009-198, provides: “Whereas, during 1940, amid the escalating mobilization of World War II, the 1st Marine Division and the 1st Marine Air Wings of the United States Marine Corps were in need of an operational staging area on the east coast of the United States; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, in the summer of 1940, Major John C. McQueen and his pilot, Captain Verne McCaul, on the orders of then Major General Thomas Holcomb, Marine Corps Commandant, undertook an aerial survey that covered the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts from Norfolk, Virginia, to Corpus Christi, Texas, and determined that 14 miles of beach in Onslow County, North Carolina, was the only suitable location for a Marine Corps base in the Eastern United States; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, in February 1941, President Roosevelt authorized an initial outlay of $1,500,000 for the survey and purchase of a 174-square-mile tract near Jacksonville, North Carolina, and on April 5, 1941, the United States Congress authorized $14,575,000 for the base’s construction; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, on May 1, 1941, the Marine Barracks New River was formally established as a major amphibious training ground and has grown since into the Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, partly bounded by U.S. Highway 17 in Jacksonville, North Carolina; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, from April 1942 until desegregation of the Marine Corps in 1949, Montford Point Camp in North Carolina was the exclusive training grounds for African-American Marines; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, from 1943 until passage of the Women’s Armed Service Integration Act in 1948, the New River Base was the principal training center for the women Marines, having trained over 20,000 women Marines; and
      </p>

       “Whereas, in 1944 the United States Marine Corps assumed control of Camp Davis at Holly Ridge when the United States Army declared it excess to their needs and utilized it to train the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, other sites along or near U.S. Highway 17 in Eastern North Carolina have historical significance to the United States Marine Corps, including major air stations at Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina, and auxiliary or outlying landing fields at Atlantic Beach, Beaufort, Bogue, Greenville, Manteo, New River, Oak Grove, Washington, and Wilson; and

      <p>
       “Whereas, the Museum of the Marine currently being planned at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, will honor the history of the Carolina-based Marines from World War II to the present and highlight the many historically significant locations along U.S. Highway 17; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, estimates show that the Museum of the Marine has the potential to draw 100,000 visitors each year, and the designation of U.S. Highway 17 as a scenic byway will add to this attraction; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, the General Assembly desires to honor the United States Marine Corps’ large and enduring military presence at locations in Eastern North Carolina along U.S. Highway 17; Now, therefore,

       The Department of Transportation is vested with the power to acquire either in the nature of an appropriate easement or in fee simple such rights-of-way and title to such land, gravel, gravel beds or bars, sand, sand beds or bars, rock, stone, boulders, quarries, or quarry beds, lime or other earth or mineral deposits or formations, and such standing timber as it may deem necessary and suitable for transportation infrastructure construction, including road construction, maintenance, and repair, and the necessary approaches and ways through, and a sufficient amount of land surrounding and adjacent thereto, as it may determine to enable it to properly prosecute the work, by purchase, donation, or condemnation, in the manner hereinafter set out. If the Department of Transportation acquires by purchase, donation, or condemnation part of a tract of land in fee simple for highway right-of-way as authorized by this section and the Department of Transportation later determines that the property acquired for transportation infrastructure, including highway right-of-way, or a part of that property, is no longer needed for infrastructure right-of-way, then the Department shall give first consideration to any offer to purchase the property made by the former owner. The Department may refuse any offer that is less than the current market value of the property, as determined by the Department. Unless the Department acquired an entire lot, block, or tract of land belonging to the former owner, the former owner must own the remainder of the lot, block, or tract of land from which the property was acquired to receive first consideration by the Department of their offer to purchase the property.

Unless the Department acquired an entire lot, block, or tract of land belonging to the former owner, the former owner must own the remainder of the lot, block, or tract of land from which the property was acquired to purchase the property pursuant to this subsection.

The Department of Transportation may, in its discretion, with the consent of the landowner, acquire in fee simple an entire lot, block or tract of land, if by so doing, the interest of the public will be best served, even though said entire lot, block or tract is not immediately needed for right-of-way purposes.

The acquirement of a total of 125 acres per mile of said parkways, including roadway and recreational, and scenic areas on either side thereof, shall be deemed a reasonable area for said purpose. The right-of-way acquired or appropriated may, at the option of the Department of Transportation, be a fee-simple title. The said Department of Transportation is hereby authorized to convey such title so acquired to the United States government, or its appropriate agency, free and clear of all claims for compensation. All compensation contracted to be paid or legally assessed shall be a valid claim against the Department of Transportation, payable out of the State Highway Fund. Any conveyance to the United States Department of Interior of land acquired as provided by this section shall contain a provision whereby the State of North Carolina shall retain concurrent jurisdiction over the areas conveyed.

        A contractor who is employed by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to do work incidental to the construction or maintenance of a public highway and who performs such work with proper care and skill cannot be held liable to an owner for damages resulting to property from the performance of the work. The injury to the property in such a case constitutes a taking of the property for public use for highway purposes, and the only remedy available to the owner is a special proceeding against the Commission (now Department) under this section to recover compensation for the property taken or damaged. But if the contractor employed by the Commission (now Department) performs his work in a negligent manner and thereby proximately injures the property of another, he is personally liable to the owner therefor.

        It is proper to show that a particular tract of land is suitable and available for division into lots and is valuable for that purpose, but it is not proper to show the number and value of lots as separated parcels in an imaginary subdivision thereof. In other words, it is not proper for the jury in these cases to consider an undeveloped tract of land as though a subdivision thereon is an accomplished fact.

        When Remedy for Denial of Access to Highway May Be Asserted. —

      <p>
       While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners’ access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter’s right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

       Whenever any road or street forming a link in or a part of the State highway system, whether under construction or heretofore or hereafter constructed, shall cross or intersect any railroad at the same level or grade, or by an underpass or overpass, and in the opinion of the Secretary of Transportation such crossing is dangerous to the traveling public, or unreasonably interferes with or impedes traffic on said State highway, the Department of Transportation shall issue notice requiring the person or company operating such railroad to appear before the Secretary of Transportation, at his office in Raleigh, upon a day named, which shall not be less than 10 days or more than 20 days from the date of said notice, and show cause, if any it has, why such railroad company shall not be required to alter such crossing in such way as to remove such dangerous condition and to make such changes and improvements thereat as will safeguard and secure the safety and convenience of the traveling public thereafter. Such notice shall be served on such railroad company as is now provided by law for the service of summons on domestic corporations, and officers serving such notice shall receive the same fees as now provided by law for the service of such summons.

       Upon the day named, the Secretary of Transportation shall hear said matter and shall determine whether such crossing is dangerous to public safety, or unreasonably interferes with traffic thereon. If he shall determine that said crossing is, or upon the completion of such highway will be, dangerous to public safety and its elimination or safeguarding is necessary for the proper protection of the traffic on said State highway, the Secretary of Transportation shall thereupon order the construction of an adequate underpass or overpass at said crossing or he may in his discretion order said railroad company to install and maintain gates, alarm signals or other approved safety devices if and when in the opinion of said Secretary of Transportation upon the hearing as aforesaid the public safety and convenience will be secured thereby. And said order shall specify that the cost of construction of such underpass or overpass or the installation of such safety device shall be allocated between the railroad company and the Department of Transportation in the same ratio as the net benefits received by such railroad company from the project bear to the net benefits accruing to the public using the highway, and in no case shall the net benefit to any railroad company or companies be deemed to be more than ten percent (10%) of the total benefits resulting from the project. The Secretary of Transportation shall be responsible for determining the proportion of the benefits derived by the railroad company from the project, and shall fix standards for the determining of said benefits which shall be consistent with the standards adopted for similar purposes by the United States Bureau of Public Roads under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944.

The work may be done and material furnished either by the railroad company or the Department of Transportation, as may be agreed upon, and the cost thereof shall be allocated and borne as set out in subsection (b) hereof.

       On the date the Department of Transportation lets a contract for a highway improvement project, a water or sewer system organized pursuant to Chapter 162A must be in existence to qualify for an exemption from the requirement that water and sewer lines on state highway right of way be relocated at local expense.

      <p>
       Grass mowing is not a professional or specialized service within the meaning of this section.
       The professional or specialized services referenced in G.S. 136-28.1(f) must be “... necessary in connection with highway construction or repair...”. Mowing grass on the right of way along public highways is a maintenance function rather than a form of highway construction or repair. See opinion of Attorney General to D.W. Bailey, P.E., Chief Engineer-Operations, Department of Transportation, 60 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 97 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contracts awarded for grass mowing services along public highways are governed by G.S. 143-49(3). See opinion of Attorney General to D.W. Bailey, P.E., Chief Engineer-Operations, Department of Transportation, 60 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 97 (1992).

      <p>
       NCDOT is vested with legal authority to execute a contract, as described in the draft Request for Proposals for completion of I-485 loop, which includes a delayed payment schedule under which contractors will receive payments for a period of time extending beyond completion and acceptance of the project.

      The Department of Transportation is authorized to permit power companies and governmental agencies, including agencies of the federal government, when it is necessary to relocate transportation infrastructure by reason of the construction of a dam, to let contracts for the construction of the relocated transportation infrastructure. The construction shall be in accordance with the Department of Transportation standards and specifications. The Department of Transportation is further authorized to reimburse the power company or governmental agency for betterments arising out of the construction of the relocated transportation infrastructure, provided the bidding and the award is in accordance with the Department of Transportation’s regulations and the Department of Transportation approves the award of the contract.

All State agencies, institutions, and political subdivisions shall cooperate with the Department of Transportation and among themselves in all efforts to conduct outreach and to encourage and promote the use of disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses in these contracts.

       At least every five years, the Department shall conduct a study on the availability and utilization of disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises and examine relevant evidence of the effects of race-based or gender-based discrimination upon the utilization of such business enterprises in contracts for planning, design, preconstruction, construction, alteration, or maintenance of State transportation infrastructure and in the procurement of materials for these projects. Should the study show a strong basis in evidence of ongoing effects of past or present discrimination that prevents or limits disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses from participating in the above contracts at a level which would have existed absent such discrimination, such evidence shall constitute a basis for the State’s continued compelling governmental interest in remedying such race and gender discrimination in transportation contracting. Under such circumstances, the Department shall, in conformity with State and federal law, adopt by rule and contract provisions a specific program to remedy such discrimination. This specific program shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, address each barrier identified in such study that adversely affects contract participation by disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses.
       

         (b1)
        
        Based upon the findings of the Department’s 2014 study entitled “North Carolina Department of Transportation Disparity Study, 2014,” hereinafter referred to as “Study”, the program design shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, incorporate narrowly tailored remedies identified in the Study, and the Department shall implement a comprehensive antidiscrimination enforcement policy. As appropriate, the program design shall be modified by rules adopted by the Department that are consistent with findings made in the Study and in subsequent studies conducted in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. As part of this program, the Department shall review its budget and establish a combined aspirational goal every three years, not a mandatory goal, in the form of a percentage, for the overall participation in contracts by disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses. This aspirational goal for disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses shall be established consistent with federal methodology and shall not be applied rigidly on specific contracts or projects. Instead, the Department shall establish a contract-specific goal or project-specific goal for the participation of such firms in a manner consistent with availability of disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses, as appropriately defined by its most recent Study. Nothing in this section shall authorize the use of quotas. Any program implemented as a result of the Study conducted in accordance with this section shall be narrowly tailored to eliminate the effects of historical and continuing discrimination and its impacts on such disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses without any undue burden on other contractors. The Department shall give equal opportunity for contracts it lets without regard to race, religion, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, or handicapping condition, as defined in

       in all respects; and (3) the prime contractor appealed, the statutory scheme did not survive intermediate scrutiny as applicable to women. The public-sector evidence as a whole did not evince the exceedingly persuasive justification the United States Supreme Court required, the State of North Carolina did not present evidence indicating the extent to which women-owned businesses competing on public-sector road projects—the targets of the remedial statute—vied for private-sector subcontracts in the general construction industry, it also failed to present any anecdotal evidence indicating that women subcontractors successfully bidding on State contracts faced private-sector discrimination, and it could not overcome the strong evidence of overutilization in the public sector; the statute was also unconstitutional as applied to Asian American, and Hispanic American subcontractors.

       in all respects; and (3) the prime contractor appealed, the State of North Carolina’s evidence showing a gross statistical disparity between the availability of qualified African American and Native American subcontractors and the amount of subcontracting dollars they won on public sector contracts established the necessary statistical foundation for upholding the minority participation goals with respect to those groups, the state’s anecdotal evidence of discrimination against those two groups sufficiently supplemented its statistical showing, and the statutory scheme was narrowly tailored to achieve North Carolina’s compelling interest in remedying discrimination in public-sector subcontracting against African American and Native American subcontractors.

        Section Does Not Offend Constitutional Right to Jury. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional guarantee of trial by jury applies only where the prerogative existed at common law or by statute at the time the Constitution was adopted. Prior to the enactment of this statute, and certainly at common law, a contractor could not institute this action against the State due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The right itself was created by this statute which never intended nor provided for a trial by jury. Therefore, the statute does not offend the constitutional guarantee to trial by jury.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether this section authorizes a suit, the district court notes the principle that statutes in derogation of the common law are generally construed strictly. On the other hand, as a remedial statute, it ought to receive from the courts such a construction as will remedy the existing evil so as to advance the remedy and permit the courts to bring the parties to an issue. Wilmington Shipyard, Inc. v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, 6 N.C. App. 649, 171 S.E.2d 222,

       </cite>
       (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that statutes waiving governmental immunity must be strictly construed does not compel the court to take the strictest possible view of this section, permitting suit against the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) on claims arising out of construction contracts, but the district court will simply examine the language of the statute within its context, mindful of the principle that the intent of the legislature controls the interpretation of a statute.

      <p>
       Although this section, as amended in 1983, terms the board an alternative to civil suit, the claim allowed to the board is nevertheless a waiver of sovereign immunity, the terms of which are to be strictly construed. The same restrictions on maintaining a claim to the board as those for a claim to superior court will be applied, for there is no language, express or implied, that the creation of this alternative was to expand the substantive rights of the contractor against the sovereign immunity of the State.

      <p>
       Prior to enactment of this section, one who had any claim growing out of a contract with the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) could not bring suit against the Commission (now Department), for it is a State agency and no consent to suit has been given. The claimant might present his claim to the General Assembly or he might invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The latter course was not very satisfactory for the court has said that in such a proceeding it will consider only questions of law. The decision of the court, if in favor of the claimant, was simply recommendatory and was reported to the next General Assembly for its action. Wilmington Shipyard, Inc. v. North Carolina State Hwy.

The General Assembly therefore determines that it is in the public interest to prohibit the use of glass beads containing more than 75 parts per million inorganic arsenic used to reflect light when applied to markings on roadways.”

The Revisor may also recodify into the new Chapter 163A of the General Statutes other existing statutory laws relating to elections and ethics enforcement that are located elsewhere in the General Statutes as the Revisor deems appropriate.” The Revisor was further authorized to make additional technical and conforming changes to catchlines, internal citations, and other references throughout the General Statutes to effectuate this recodification. Pursuant to this authority, the Revisor of Statutes substituted “G.S. 163A-1300” for “G.S. 163-227.2” in subsection (b).

       Upon appropriation of funds by the General Assembly to the Department of Transportation for State aid to municipalities, one-half of the amount appropriated shall be allocated in cash on or before October 1 of each year to the cities and towns of the State in accordance with this section. The second one-half of the amount appropriated shall be allocated in cash on or before January 1 of each year to the cities and towns of the State in accordance with this section.Seventy-five percent (75%) of the funds appropriated for cities and towns shall be distributed among the several eligible municipalities of the State in the percentage proportion that the population of each eligible municipality bears to the total population of all eligible municipalities according to the most recent annual estimates of population as certified to the Secretary of Revenue by the State Budget Officer. This annual estimation of population shall include increases in the population within the municipalities caused by annexations accomplished through July 1 of the calendar year in which these funds are distributed. Twenty-five percent (25%) of said fund shall be distributed among the several eligible municipalities of the State in the percentage proportion that the mileage of public streets in each eligible municipality which does not form a part of the State highway system bears to the total mileage of the public streets in all eligible municipalities which do not constitute a part of the State highway system.It shall be the duty of the mayor of each municipality to report to the Department of Transportation such information as it may request for its guidance in determining the eligibility of each municipality to receive funds under this section and in determining the amount of allocation to which each is entitled. Upon failure of any municipality to make such report within the time prescribed by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Transportation may disregard such defaulting unit in making said allotment.The funds to be allocated under this section shall be paid in cash to the various eligible municipalities on or before October 1 and January 1 of each year as provided in this section. Provided that eligible municipalities are authorized within the discretion of their governing bodies to enter into contracts for the purpose of maintenance, repair, construction, reconstruction, widening, or improving streets of such municipalities at any time after January 1 of any calendar year in total amounts not to exceed ninety percent (90%) of the amount received by such municipality during the preceding fiscal year, in anticipation of the receipt of funds under this section during the next fiscal year, to be paid for out of such funds when received.The Department of Transportation may withhold each year an amount not to exceed one percent (1%) of the total amount appropriated for distribution under this section for the purpose of correcting errors in allocations: Provided, that the amount so withheld and not used for correcting errors will be carried over and added to the amount to be allocated for the following year.The word “street” as used in this section is hereby defined as any public road maintained by a municipality and open to use by the general public, and having an average width of not less than 16 feet. In order to obtain the necessary information to distribute the funds herein allocated, the Department of Transportation may require that each municipality eligible to receive funds under this section submit to it a statement, certified by a registered engineer or surveyor of the total number of miles of streets in such municipality. The Department of Transportation may in its discretion require the certification of mileage on a biennial basis.

       The General Assembly hereby designates the Department of Transportation as the agency of the State of North Carolina responsible for administering all State and federal railroad revitalization programs. The Department of Transportation is authorized to develop, and the Board of Transportation is authorized to adopt, a State railroad plan, and the Department of Transportation is authorized to do all things necessary under applicable State and federal legislation to properly administer State and federal railroad revitalization programs within the State. Such authority shall include, but shall not be limited to, the power to receive federal funds and distribute and expend federal and State funds for rail programs designed to cover the costs of acquiring, by purchase, lease or other manner as the department considers appropriate, a railroad line or other rail property to maintain existing or to provide future rail service; the costs of rehabilitating and improving rail property on railroad lines to the extent necessary to permit safe, adequate and efficient rail service on such lines; and the costs of constructing rail or rail related facilities for the purpose of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of rail service. The Department shall also have the authority to preserve railroad corridors for future railroad use and interim compatible uses and may lease such corridors for interim compatible uses. Such authority shall also include the power to receive and administer federal financial assistance without State financial participation to railroad companies to cover the costs of local rail service continuation payments, of rail line rehabilitation, and of rail line construction as listed above. This Article shall not be construed to grant to the department the power or authority to operate directly any rail line or rail facilities.

Failure of the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, or the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Department of Transportation to hold a meeting with the Department of Transportation within 60 days of a written request for a meeting from the Department of Transportation shall be deemed a waiver of consultation by the committee.

         Approval. —  If either the amount of State matching funds required by the federal grant or the amount of future annual maintenance and operational costs of the project are reasonably expected to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000), then the Department’s acceptance of funds shall be subject to approval of the project by an act of the General Assembly. If 30 days have passed since consultation or the expiration of the consultation period under subdivision (2) of this subsection, then the inaction of the General Assembly, including the lack of an extra session to address the project, shall be deemed an approval of the project, and the Department may accept the funds without an act of the General Assembly.

          For purposes of this subsection, the terms “State matching funds” and “annual maintenance and operational costs to the State” shall not include funds that may pass through the Department of Transportation but that originally came from a non-State source.

      The general purpose of the laws creating the Department of Transportation is that said Department of Transportation shall take over, establish, construct, and maintain a statewide system of hard-surfaced and other dependable highways running to all county seats, and to all principal towns, State parks, and principal State institutions, and linking up with state highways of adjoining states and with national highways into national forest reserves by the most practical routes, with special view of development of agriculture, commercial and natural resources of the State, and, except as otherwise provided by law, for the further purpose of permitting the State to assume control of the State highways, repair, construct, and reconstruct and maintain said highways at the expense of the entire State, and to relieve the counties and cities and towns of the State of this burden.

      Provided, that for the purpose of providing for the payment of any bonded or other indebtedness, and for the interest thereon, that may be outstanding as an obligation of any county, district, or township commission herein abolished, the boards of county commissioners of the respective counties are hereby constituted fiscal agents, and are vested with authority and it shall be their duty to levy such taxes on the taxable property or persons within the respective county, district, or township by or for which said bonds or other indebtedness were issued or incurred and as are now authorized by law to the extent that the same may be necessary to provide for the payment of such obligations; and the respective commissions herein abolished shall on or before July 1, 1931, turn over to said boards of county commissioners any moneys on hand or evidences of indebtedness properly applicable to the discharge of any such indebtedness (except such moneys as are mentioned in paragraph (a) above); and all uncollected special road taxes shall be payable to said boards of county commissioners, and the portion of said taxes applicable to indebtedness shall be applied by said commissioners to said indebtedness, or invested in a sinking fund according to law. All that portion of said taxes or other funds coming into the hands of said county commissioners and properly applicable to the maintenance or improvement of the public roads of the county shall be held by them as a special road fund and disbursed upon proper orders of the Department of Transportation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, further, that in order to fully carry out the provisions of this section the respective boards of county commissioners are vested with full authority to prosecute all suitable legal actions.

      Nothing in this section shall prevent a county from participating in the cost of rights-of-way, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road on the State highway system under agreement with the Department of Transportation. A county is authorized and empowered to acquire land by dedication and acceptance, purchase, or eminent domain and make improvements to portions of the State highway system lying within or outside the county limits utilizing local funds that have been authorized for that purpose.

When any such complaint is filed, the Department of Transportation shall at once investigate the same, and if the same be well founded, the said Department of Transportation shall at once order the repair and maintenance of the roads complained of and investigate the negligence of the persons in charge of the roads so complained of, and if upon investigation the person in charge of the road complained of be at fault, he may be discharged from the service of the Department of Transportation. The board of commissioners of any county, who shall feel aggrieved at the action of the Department of Transportation upon complaint filed, may appeal from the decision of the Department of Transportation to the Governor, and it shall be the duty of the Governor to adjust the differences between the board of county commissioners and the Department of Transportation.

       Before any permit may be issued for the temporary inundation and closing of such a road, an application for such permit shall be made to the Department of Transportation by the public body having jurisdiction over the watershed improvement project. The application shall specify the secondary road involved, the anticipated frequency and duration of intermittent flooding of the secondary road involved, and shall request that a permit be granted to the applicant public body to allow the intermittent closing of the road.

       Upon receipt of such an application the Department of Transportation shall give public notice of the proposed action by publication once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties within which the proposed intermittent closing of road or roads would occur; and such notices shall contain a description of the places of beginning and the places of ending of such intermittent closing. In addition, the Department of Transportation shall give notice to all public utilities or common carriers having facilities located within the rights-of-way of any roads being closed by mailing copies of such notices to the appropriate offices of the public utility or common carrier having jurisdiction over the affected facilities of the public utility or common carrier. Not sooner than 14 days after publication and mailing of notices, the Department of Transportation or the municipality may issue its permit with respect to such road.

       The Department of Transportation shall have the discretion to deny any application submitted pursuant to this section, or it may grant a permit on any condition it deems warranted. The Department, however, shall consider the use of alternate routes available during flooding of the roads, and any inconvenience to the public or temporary loss of access to business, homes and property. The Department shall have the authority to promulgate regulations for the issuance of permits under this section and it may delegate the authority for the consideration, issuance or denial of such permits to the Chief Engineer. Any applicant granted a permit pursuant to this section shall cause suitable markers to be installed on the secondary road to advise the general public of the intermittent closing of the road or roads involved. Such markers shall be located and approved by the Chief Engineer.

       indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes, these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with.

       indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes, these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with.

       indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes, these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with.

        The first statutory definition of neighborhood public road was enacted in 1933. The “private use” exclusion was added by amendment in 1941. And the remainder of the proviso, beginning after the phrase “essentially private use,” was added in 1949. Jarvis v. Powers, 80 N.C. App. 355, 343 S.E.2d 195,

Every segment of public road which has been abandoned as a part of the State road system coming within the terms of the statute is thus, by legislative enactment, established as a neighborhood public road.

        This section declares three distinct types of roads to be neighborhood public roads.
        
        The first portion of the section concerns only those roads which were once a part of the “public road system.” The second type of road declared by this section to be a neighborhood public road was all those roads that had been laid out, constructed, or reconstructed with unemployment relief funds under the supervision of the Department of Public Welfare (now the Department of Human Resources). The third type declared by this section to be a neighborhood public road (after the 1941 and 1949 revisions) was all those roads outside the boundaries of municipal corporations which served a public use and as a means of ingress and egress for one or more families.

        The proviso that no road serving an “essentially private use” could be declared a neighborhood public road should be distinguished from the requirement under the third definition that a road must have served a public use. The proviso allows for some public use, but requires a determination of whether the road was “essentially” a private or a public roadway. Jarvis v. Powers, 80 N.C. App. 355, 343 S.E.2d 195,

From any final order or judgment in said special proceeding, any interested party may appeal to the superior court for a jury trial de novo on all issues including the right to relief, the location of a cartway, tramway or railway, and the assessment of damages. The procedure established under Chapter 40A, entitled “Eminent Domain,” shall be followed in the conduct of such special proceeding insofar as the same is applicable and in harmony with the provisions of this section.

       The legislature has vested in the clerks of the superior courts of the State jurisdiction over proceedings relating to the establishment, maintenance, alteration, discontinuance, or abandonment of neighborhood public roads, church roads, and cartways.

       (1) the land in question is used for one of the purposes enumerated in the statute; (2) the land is without adequate access to a public road or other adequate means of transportation affording necessary and proper ingress and egress; and (3) the granting of a private way over the lands of other persons is necessary, reasonable and just.

       Because: (1) the Court of Appeals of North Carolina declined to add a fourth element to the landowners’ burden of proof in the first part of the cartway proceeding; (2) the jury instruction on the element of the landowners’ claim to establish the right to a cartway, requiring them to show that their land was being used for one of the purposes enumerated in the statute, conformed with the pattern jury instructions without the addition of the language suggested by the adjoining landowners and fairly and accurately stated the landowners’ element of proof as to the use of their property; and (3) the instruction requested by the adjoining landowners gave undue emphasis to their claim the landowners’ intended to use the land for future residential development, which, while not enumerated under the statute, did not defeat the landowners’ right to a cartway, the trial court’s orders denying both a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were upheld on appeal.

     <p>
      The General Assembly hereby finds that it is in the public interest, health, safety, and welfare for the State to encourage and provide for the efficient and safe use of the bicycle; and that to coordinate plans for bikeways most effectively with those of the State and local governments as they affect roads, streets, schools, parks and other publicly owned lands, abandoned roadbeds and conservation areas, while maximizing the benefits from the use of tax dollars, a single State agency, eligible to receive federal matching funds, should be designated to establish and maintain a statewide bikeways program. The General Assembly also finds that bikeways are a bona fide highway purpose, subject to the same rights and responsibilities, and eligible for the same considerations as other highway purposes and functions.

       While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners’ access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter’s right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

       It is well-settled law in this State that the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is vested by statute with broad discretionary authority in the performance of its statutory duties, and the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), and control the discretion vested in the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to acquire by condemnation property sought to be acquired for “controlled-access facilities”; the exercise by it of such discretionary authority and powers is not subject to judicial review, unless its action is so clearly unreasonable as to amount to oppressive and manifest abuse.

       While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners’ access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter’s right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

      The Department of Transportation may designate and establish controlled-access highways as new and additional facilities or may designate and establish an existing street or highway as included within a controlled-access facility. When an existing street or highway shall be designated as and included within a controlled-access facility the owners of land abutting such existing street or highway shall be entitled to compensation for the taking of or injury to their easements of access. The Department of Transportation shall have authority to provide for the elimination of intersections at grade of controlled-access facilities with existing State highways and county roads, and city and town streets, by grade separation or frontage road, or by closing off such roads and streets, or other public ways at the right-of-way boundary line of such controlled-access facility; and after the establishment of any controlled-access facility, no highway or street which is not part of said facility shall intersect the same at grade. No street or [of] any city or town and no State highway, county road, or other public way shall be opened into or connected with any such controlled-access facility without the consent and previous approval of the Department of Transportation. Such consent and approval shall be given only if the public interest shall be served thereby.

      <p>
       North Carolina recognizes the fundamental right to just compensation
       
       as so grounded in natural law and justice that it is part of the fundamental law of this State, and imposes upon a governmental agency taking private property for public use a correlative duty to make just compensation to the owner of the property taken. This principle is considered in North Carolina as an integral part of the law of the land within the meaning of N.C. Const., Art. I, § 19. The requirement that just compensation be paid for land taken for a public use is likewise guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Department of Transp. v. Harkey,

       When the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), in the interest of the public safety, convenience and general welfare, without the taking or destruction of a property right, regulates the right to enter upon or to proceed along a controlled-access highway, the owner of land which is thereby diminished in value, such as by the diminution in volume of traffic upon the highway in front of it, is not entitled to compensation.

      <p>
       While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners’ access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter’s right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

      In connection with the development of any controlled-access facility the Department of Transportation is authorized to plan, designate, establish, use, regulate, alter, improve, maintain, and vacate local service or frontage roads and streets or to designate as local service or frontage roads and streets any existing road or street, and to exercise jurisdiction over service or frontage roads in the same manner as is authorized over controlled-access facilities under the terms of this Article, if in its opinion such local service or frontage roads and streets are necessary or desirable; provided, however that after a local service or frontage road has been established, the same shall not be vacated or abandoned in such a manner as to reduce access to the facility without the consent of the abutting property owners or the payment of just compensation, so long as the controlled-access facility is maintained as such facility, and the Department of Transportation shall not have any authority to control or restrict the right of access of abutting property owners from their property to such local service or frontage roads or streets without the property owners’ consent or the payment of just compensation, except such authority as the Department of Transportation has with respect to primary and secondary roads under the police power. Such local service or frontage roads or streets shall be of appropriate design, and shall be separated from the controlled-access facility proper by means of all devices designated as necessary or desirable.

     Legislative findings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the existing State road system is becoming increasingly congested and overburdened with traffic in many areas of the State; that the sharp surge of vehicle miles traveled is overwhelming the State’s ability to build and pay for adequate road improvements; and that an adequate answer to this challenge will require the State to be innovative and utilize several new approaches to transportation improvements in North Carolina.
     </p>
     <p>
      Toll funding of highway and bridge construction is feasible in North Carolina and can contribute to addressing the critical transportation needs of the State. A toll program can speed the implementation of needed transportation improvements by funding some projects with tolls.

       Session Laws 2005-275, s. 6(a), effective August 12, 2005, provides: “The General Assembly finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) The existing Herbert C. Bonner Bridge spanning Oregon Inlet, an essential link in the State’s transportation network, is in imminent danger of failure and possible collapse due to its low stability rating and substandard condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) The Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, which was opened to traffic in 1963, has extended beyond its original projected life span, and that Department of Transportation engineering reports indicated in 1993 that the bridge had only six years of safe usage left.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) The condition of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge poses significant imminent threats to public health and safety to thousands of residents and visitors at all times, and jeopardizes emergency management operations and evacuations during times of natural disasters.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) The condition of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge also threatens the economic stability of the tourist economy of the region, tourism being the region’s main industry, and also threatens the viability of Oregon Inlet as the region’s main transportation corridor for commercial and recreational fishing industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) The replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge has been studied for over a decade, during which time the condition of the bridge has continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) Failure or collapse of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge will result in catastrophic harm to public health, safety, and welfare, the potential harm to and loss of lives, and loss of access to the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, which is one of our country’s most important natural wildlife and wildfowl habitats.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(7) Replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge is critical to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and maintain necessary transportation access for emergency management and economic purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(8) Replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge must occur as soon as is practicable, and authorization must be given to the Department of Transportation to pursue expedited permitting, design, and construction to ensure that the replacement bridge is open to the public before the existing bridge fails or collapses.”

        Department Erred In Denying Driveway Permit Application. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The Driveway Permit Statute, G.S. 136-18(29), specifically and unambiguously provides an exclusive list of how DOT may regulate driveway connections, as well as an exclusive list of improvements it may require of an applicant. Because the Driveway Permit Statute treats an owner’s access to the State highway system in specific terms, and because it is clear and unambiguous, courts are not permitted to engage in statutory construction and the statute authorized no requirement to make improvements away from the applicant’s property, and it similarly failed to empower DOT to require an applicant to obtain another property owner’s approval, giving that property owner veto power over the applicant’s project. DOT acted in excess of its statutory authority when it conditioned the developer’s driveway permit on widening a railroad crossing one-quarter of a mile away from the driveway connection and on the developer’s obtaining consent from two railroad companies.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2a">
       Program Created. —  The Department shall develop a fee-supported express permit review program in each highway division. The program is voluntary for permit applicants and applies to permits, approvals, or certifications that allow for a connection to the State highway system through the use of a driveway, street, signal, drainage, or any other encroachment.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2b">
       Implementation. —  An individual highway division may opt out of the express permit review program created under this section if the highway division routinely reviews and issues special commercial permits within an average of 45 days. Any express permit review program created under this section shall be supported by the fees established pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2c">
       Procedure. —  In reviewing a permit application under the express permit review program, the Department shall undergo the following steps:
       <ol>
        <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2c1">
         The Department shall, within three business days of receipt, determine whether an express permit review application is complete. If the Department determines the express permit review application is not complete, the Department shall return the express permit review application and all fees to the permit applicant to allow for a complete express permit review application to be resubmitted to the Department.
        </li>
        <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2c12">
         If the Department determines the express permit review application is complete, the Department shall, within 45 days, issue or deny the permit based upon its review of the application. Failure of the Department to issue or deny the permit within 45 days is a denial of the express permit review application.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2d">
       Staffing. —  In order to implement the express permit review program, the Department may utilize either of the following or a combination thereof:
       <ol>
        <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2d1">
         Existing Department staff and resources.
        </li>
        <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2d12">
         Contracted engineering firms supporting each highway division to provide express permit reviews, comments, and recommendations for issuing express permits. If the Department utilizes contracted engineering firms to provide work under this section, any fees received by the Department pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be credited towards the cost of the Department utilizing these contracted engineering firms. Any additional costs associated with engaging the contracted engineering firm shall be agreed to by the permit applicant prior to incurring the costs and shall be paid by the permit applicant.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2e">
       Fees. —  The Department may determine the fees for an express application review under the express review program conducted by highway division staff. Unless a contracted engineering firm is utilized, the maximum permit application fee to be charged under this section for an express review of a project application requiring all of the permits listed under subsection (a) of this section shall not exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000). Notwithstanding Chapter 150B of the General Statutes, the Department shall establish the procedure by which the amount of the fees under this subsection are established and applied for an express review program permitted by this section. The fee schedule established by the Department shall be applicable to all divisions participating in an express permit review program.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a07s136-93.1ol2f">
       Use of Fees. —  All fees collected under this section shall be used to fund the cost of administering and implementing express permit review programs created under this section. These costs include the salaries of the program’s staff and costs of contracted engineering firms.

       The streets in question were dedicated to the public more than 20 years prior to the institution of this action by the sale of lots in a subdivision with reference to a plat showing the streets. The streets were never actually opened or used at any time, and no person asserted any public or private easement therein within two years from the passage of this Article, or at any other time. The streets in question are not necessary to afford convenient ingress or egress to any other lots in the subdivision. The corporation making the dedication no longer exists. Plaintiffs, claimants under dedicator, filed and recorded a declaration withdrawing said streets from the dedication. It was held that the revocation of the dedication terminated the easement of the public and of the purchasers of lots in the subdivision, and therefore plaintiffs own the fee in the said land and can convey same free of the easements.

       In an action to recover for injuries sustained when the car in which plaintiffs were riding struck a limb lying on a dirt highway, it was shown that defendant was a divisional engineer of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), that the highway in question was embraced within his division, that defendant was given notice that the limb was lying across the highway and that the accident occurred some six hours after such notice. It was held that defendant’s motion to nonsuit was properly allowed, since, if defendant’s failure to remove the limb was a breach of an official or governmental duty involving the exercise of discretion, there was neither allegation nor evidence of corruption or malice, and if such duty was a ministerial duty it was of a public nature imposed entirely for the public benefit, and there was neither allegation nor proof that this section provided for personal liability.

        Power of Eminent Domain Is Prerogative of Sovereign State. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to take private property for public use, the power of eminent domain, is one of the prerogatives of a sovereign state. The right is inherent in sovereignty; it is not conferred by constitutions. Its exercise, however, is limited by the constitutional requirements of due process and payment of just compensation for property condemned. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        275 N.C. 328

       </cite>
       (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the legislative branch can authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain
       
       and prescribe the manner of its use. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
       <cite class="nc_code">

       </cite>
       (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain must be conferred by statute,
       
       either in express words or by necessary implication. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        275 N.C. 328

       The right of eminent domain lies dormant in the State until the legislature, by statute, confers the power and points out the occasion, mode, conditions and agencies for its exercise. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,

       Hence, the executive branch of the government cannot, without the authority of some statute, proceed to condemn property for its own uses. Once authority is given to exercise the power of eminent domain, the matter ceases to be wholly legislative. The executive authorities may then decide whether the power will be invoked and to what extent, and the judiciary must decide whether the statute authorizing the taking violates any constitutional rights.

       Trial court properly entered judgment awarding a property owner no further damages than the amount of a condemnor’s deposit because any error by the trial court in dismissing the motion for a hearing was not prejudicial inasmuch as the owner filed its motion less than 10 before trial was to begin, the owner was not deprived of its right to pursue its inverse condemnation claims in a separate action, the owner made no argument concerning how either order affected a substantial right such that the trial court was divested of jurisdiction to proceed to trial and enter further orders, and the owner’s motion for a continuance was not filed until the week before the scheduled trial date.

       A contractor employed by the Department of Transportation cannot be held liable to a property owner for damages resulting from the work done with proper skill and care.

        The provision allowing general benefits to set off the fair market value of the remaining part of a tract of land under this section violates the constitutional requirement of providing just compensation in condemnation proceedings, and the equal protection rights of property owners, because the statute allows a compensation which is unjust to the condemnee while providing a windfall to the public. The property owner is subjected to an involuntary taking of his property while also being subjected to the injustice of receiving an amount less than what he actually lost. He is being required to carry the undue burden of paying an additional cost not paid by the rest of the public. DOT v. Rowe, 138 N.C. App. 329, 531 S.E.2d 836,

The owner’s actual plans or hopes for the future are completely irrelevant. Such aspirations are regarded as too remote and speculative to merit consideration. City of Winston-Salem v. Davis, 59 N.C.

        It is proper to show in a highway condemnation proceeding that a particular tract of land is suitable and available for division into lots and is valuable for that purpose, but it is not proper to show the number and value of lots as separated parcels in an imaginary subdivision thereof. In other words, it is not proper for the jury in these cases to consider an undeveloped tract of land as though a subdivision thereon is an accomplished fact. Such undeveloped property may not be valued on a per lot basis. The cost factor is too speculative. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Reeves, 8 N.C. App. 47, 173 S.E.2d 494,

        The fair market value of undeveloped land immediately before condemnation is not a speculative value based on an imaginary subdivision and sales in lots to many purchasers.

        Although the language of a jury instruction in an eminent domain case, which stated that the jury should have based its verdict on the “peculiar” value of the property rather than the difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before and after the taking, would likely have been problematic in isolation, the instructions, when viewed contextually and in their entirety, were without error; in light of the trial court’s repeated use of the proper calculation of damages throughout its instructions, the isolated statement of the value peculiar to the church was likely not misleading, and did not warrant invalidation of the award.

        Where the property essentially had no fair market value once the 1992 corridor map was recorded, and there was no other evidence of the value of the property using a cost approach or an income capitalization approach, the owners were effectively paying taxes on property that had no value; thus, it was appropriate for the trial court to take into account the effect of the reduced ad valorem taxes and compensate the owners for the actual taxes they paid at a time when their property had virtually no fair market value.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the rapid growth and the spread of urban development along and near the State highways is encroaching upon or eliminating many areas having significant scenic or aesthetic values, which if restored, preserved and enhanced would promote the enjoyment of travel and the protection of the public investment in highways within the State and would constitute important physical, aesthetic or economic assets to the State. It is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this statute to provide a means whereby the Department of Transportation may acquire the fee or any lesser interest or right in real property in order to restore, preserve and enhance natural or scenic beauty of areas traversed by the highways of the State highway system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The General Assembly hereby declares that it is a public purpose and in the public interest of the people of North Carolina, to expend public funds, in connection with the construction, reconstruction or improvement of State highways, for the acquisition of the fee or any lesser interest in real property in the vicinity of public highways forming a part of the State highway system, in order to restore, preserve and enhance natural or scenic beauty. The General Assembly hereby finds, determines and declares that this Article is necessary for the immediate preservation and promotion of public convenience, safety and welfare.

       This Article does not affect signs located in areas zoned commercial or industrial
       
       and nothing in it prohibits municipalities from regulating advertising which falls outside its provisions. This interpretation is supported by G.S. 160A-174(b) which expressly provides that the fact that “a State or federal law, standing alone, makes a given act, omission or condition unlawful shall not preclude city ordinances requiring a higher standard of conduct or condition.” Thus, a town is authorized to outlaw outdoor advertising which is not regulated by State law and to provide compensation by amortization since in such instance this Article’s compensation provision has no relevance.

     Judicial review.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary of Transportation after exhausting all administrative remedies made available to him by rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this Article is entitled to judicial review of such decision under this Article. In order to obtain judicial review of the Secretary of Transportation’s decision under this Article, the person seeking review must file a petition in the Superior Court of Wake County within 30 days after written copy of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation is served upon the person seeking review. Failure to file such a petition within the time stated shall operate as a waiver of the right of such person to review under this Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall state explicitly what exceptions are taken to the decision of the Secretary of Transportation and what relief petitioner seeks. Within 10 days after the petition is filed with the court, the person seeking the review shall serve copies of the petition by registered mail, return receipt requested, upon the Department of Transportation. Within 30 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Department of Transportation shall transmit to the reviewing court a certified copy of the written decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time before or during the review proceeding, the aggrieved party may apply to the reviewing court for an order staying the operation of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation pending the outcome of the review. The court may grant or deny the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. The review of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation under this Article shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall hear the matter de novo pursuant to the rules of evidence as applied in the General Court of Justice. The court, after hearing the matter may affirm, reverse or modify the decision if the decision is:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t136a11s136-134.1ol61">

       <p>
        A party to the review proceedings, including the agency, may appeal to the appellate division from the final judgment of the Superior Court under the rules of procedure applicable in civil cases. The appealing party may apply to the Superior Court for a stay for its final determination or a stay of the administrative decision, whichever shall be appropriate, pending the outcome of the appeal to the appellate division.

      The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that although junkyards are a legitimate business, the establishment and use and maintenance of junkyards in the vicinity of the interstate and primary highways or within the vicinity of North Carolina routes in counties that have no interstate or federal aid primary highways within the State should be regulated and controlled in order to promote the safety, health, welfare and convenience and enjoyment of travel on and the protection of the public investment in highways within the State, to prevent unreasonable distraction of operators of motor vehicles and to prevent interference with the effectiveness of traffic regulations, to attract tourists and promote the prosperity, economic well-being and general welfare of the State, and to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty of the highways and areas in the vicinity. It is the intention of the General Assembly to provide and declare herein a public policy and statutory basis for regulation and control of junkyards.

      It is the responsibility of sworn law enforcement officers to write citations for the criminal enforcement of the Junkyard Control Act; the local district attorney ultimately determines the merits of prosecuting cases based on such citations. See opinion of Attorney General to John T. Kilby, on behalf of the Ashe County Board of Commissioners, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 27 (10/9/02).

      The Junkyard Control Act does not expressly give a private right of action to individual citizens, however, it does not preempt the authority of local municipal and county governments to enact their own restrictions or bans on junkyards. See opinion of Attorney General to John T. Kilby, on behalf of the Ashe County Board of Commissioners, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 27 (10/9/02).

     Judicial review.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary of Transportation after exhausting all administrative remedies made available to him by rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this Article is entitled to judicial review of such decision under this Article. In order to obtain judicial review of the Secretary of Transportation’s decision under this Article, the person seeking review must file a petition in the superior court of the county in which the junkyard is located within 30 days after written copy of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation is served upon the person seeking review. Failure to file such a petition within the time stated shall operate as a waiver of the right of such person to review under this Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition shall state explicitly what exceptions are taken to the decisions of the Secretary of Transportation and what relief petitioner seeks. Within 10 days after the petition is filed with the court, the person seeking the review shall serve copies of the petition by registered mail, return receipt requested, upon the Department of Transportation. Within 30 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Department of Transportation shall transmit to the reviewing court a certified copy of the written decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time before or during the review proceeding, the aggrieved party may apply to the reviewing court for an order staying the operation of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation pending the outcome of the review. The court may grant or deny the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. The review of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation under this Article shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall hear the matter de novo pursuant to the rules of evidence as applied in the general court of justice. The court, after hearing the matter may affirm, reverse or modify the decision if the decision is:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t136a12s136-149.1ol11">

       <p>
        A party to the review proceedings, including the agency, may appeal to the appellate division from the final judgment of the superior court under the rules of procedure applicable in other civil cases. The appealing party may apply to the superior court for a stay for its final determination or a stay of the administrative decision, whichever shall be appropriate, pending the outcome of the appeal to the appellate division.

      The preamble to Session Laws 2001-266 reads as follows: “Whereas, levels of congestion on interstate highways and at major airports along the east coast of the United States are rapidly rising, and in some locations have reached virtual gridlock for hours each day; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, it is therefore necessary to develop and use alternative modes of transportation for the movement of goods and passengers long distances along the east-coast corridor; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, preliminary engineering studies have documented that the creation of high-speed passenger rail service between points in Virginia and points in North Carolina could provide travelers along the corridor with an attractive alternative to highway travel, thus reducing highway congestion; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, establishment of high-speed passenger rail service between Virginia and North Carolina offers the additional possibility of connection through the District of Columbia to origins and destinations as far north as New England; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, establishment of high-speed passenger rail service between Virginia and North Carolina offers the additional possibility of connections to destinations in the South, including Florida, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, the Virginia General Assembly by passage of Senate Joint Resolution 396 of the 2001 Session has taken its action to create the Virginia-North Carolina Interstate High-Speed Rail Commission; and
     </p>

      In conducting its study, the Commission shall hold regularly scheduled meetings in this State and in Virginia, tours of inspection, and public hearings as appropriate to determine the desirability and feasibility of establishing high-speed passenger rail service between Virginia and North Carolina. The Commission shall also study the establishment of an interstate high-speed rail compact between North Carolina, Virginia, and other states. If it appears to the Commission that establishment of such service or compact is desirable and feasible, the Commission shall consider and recommend to the Governor and General Assembly those legislative actions necessary to do so, including the identification of the necessary levels of funding and the sources of those funds.

        When a railroad corporation obtains land in condemnation proceedings, it procures merely an easement,
        
        to be used only for railroad purposes. Condemnation is not to be used as a means of acquiring property for the benefit of the corporation, and the corporation has no right or authority to use or let the property for private or nonrailroad purposes. Such a right-of-way is an easement for railroad purposes and does not deprive the owner of the fee or its use for purposes not inconsistent with its use for railroad purposes.

        Where a railroad accepts the benefits of statutory authorization and changes the grade of a street or highway, it must assume and comply with the burden imposed and restore the street to a useful condition. If, to meet the burden so imposed, it becomes necessary to go beyond the railroad right-of-way and change the grade of a street, thereby impairing access of an abutting property owner, compensation must be paid for the diminution in value resulting from the denial of access.

        It is doubtful whether the statute can be construed to authorize the exclusive appropriation of the street. The sidewalk is a portion of the street appropriated to the use of pedestrians. To construe the grant of the right to construct its road across, along, or upon a street, always of much greater width than a railroad track and the crossties, as a grant of the right to occupy the entire street or sidewalk, is not permissible in the light of the recognized rule of construction of such grants of power.

        Where a railroad company has a right to condemn a way across the track of another company to manufacturing plants for a spur track to which the other company also has its siding, in competition for freight, the question whether it is necessary for the plaintiff company to build its spur is one in its discretion; and controversies as to whether the defendant could and would shift the plaintiff’s cars on its own track advantageously to the plaintiff, and for a reasonable charge, are immaterial.

       Where a railroad accepts the benefits of statutory authorization and changes the grade of a street or highway, it must assume and comply with the burden imposed and restore the street to a useful condition. If, to meet the burden so imposed, it becomes necessary to go beyond the railroad right-of-way and change the grade of a street, thereby impairing access of an abutting property owner, compensation must be paid for the diminution in value resulting from the denial of access.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol11">
       Increased use of rail for transport of freight will reduce highway congestion as well as allow economic expansion in a way that lessens the impact on the State highway system.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol12">
       Public transportation, in addition to a program of urban loops and toll roads, will enable North Carolina to have a balanced 21st century transportation system.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol13">
       As part of its initial program of internal improvements, the State capitalized the North Carolina Railroad in the 1840s and invested in other railroads, and those internal improvements led to North Carolina’s rapid economic development. The North Carolina Railroad, with a 317-mile corridor from Charlotte to Morehead City, is still owned by the State.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol14">
       Improved rail facilities and restoration of abandoned rail lines can allow increased access to the North Carolina State ports and military installations located within the State.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol15">
       Session Law 2005-222 found that expanding and upgrading passenger, freight, commuter, and short-line rail service is important to the economy of North Carolina; and provided that the State would seek to provide matching funds partly so it can leverage the maximum federal and private participation to fund needed rail initiatives, such as the restoration of the rail corridor from Wallace to Castle Hayne and a rail connection between north-south and east-west routes in the vicinity of Pembroke.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol16">
       Rail freight plays a vital role in economic development throughout the State. Intermodal service depends on partnerships with railroads, trucking companies, seaports, and others in the transportation logistics chain. North Carolina has 3,250 mainline miles of track, with Class I railroads holding seventy-nine percent (79%) of the trackage rights, the remainder controlled by local railroads and switching and terminal railroads. The 2006 Mid-Cycle Update to the North Carolina Statewide Intermodal Transportation Plan identified seven hundred ninety-nine million dollars ($799,000,000) in freight rail needs over the next 25 years, including maintenance and preservation, modernization, and expansion.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol17">
       North Carolina’s short-line railroads play a key role in the State’s economic development and transportation service and are needed to provide essential services to other modes of transportation and the North Carolina port system. North Carolina agriculture is dependent upon essential service by short-line railroads. State funds are needed to maintain short-line railroads as viable contributors to economic development, agriculture, and transportation in this State in order to prevent the loss of regional rail service. The Department of Transportation reported that 44,992 rail cars handled by short-lines kept 179,688 trucks off North Carolina highways. Short-line railroads are essential to preserve and develop jobs in rural and small urban areas of North Carolina.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol18">
       Intermodal facilities and inland ports can greatly reduce freight traffic on North Carolina’s highway system, reducing demand, congestion, and damage.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol19">
       The proposed North Carolina International Terminal will need high-capacity intermodal access.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol110">
       Most of North Carolina’s growth is in its urban regions. According to the State Data Center, during the first decade of the 21st century, sixty-six percent (66%) of the projected 1,270,000 growth in population is in 15 urban counties surrounding Charlotte, Raleigh, and the Triad, while forty percent (40%) is in just six counties: Mecklenburg, Wake, Durham, Orange, Forsyth, and Guilford.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol111">
       This large urban population growth greatly taxes resources. Despite the visionary creation of the Highway Trust Fund by the 1989 General Assembly and the funding of urban loop highways, congestion continues to worsen. Creation of a special fund to help meet urban transportation needs with alternatives such as rail transit and buses, coupled with land-use planning, will spur and guide economic development in a more economically and environmentally sound manner. Investment in public transportation facilitates economic opportunity to the State through job creation, access to employment, and residential and commercial development. Public transportation also protects the public health by decreasing air pollution and reducing carbon emissions. It reduces traffic congestion, road expenditures, public and private parking costs, and the number of traffic accidents. Charlotte’s recent success in opening the first phase of its light rail system, with ridership significantly over projections, shows that North Carolinians are willing to use transportation alternatives.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol112">
       Significant local revenues are needed to match State funds so that a major portion of the expenses is borne by the localities receiving the majority of the benefits. A local option sales tax for public transportation was approved by a fifty-eight percent (58%) favorable vote in Mecklenburg County in 1998 and reaffirmed by a seventy percent (70%) favorable vote in 2007. Extending this authority to additional jurisdictions, along with other revenue options, will enable localities to demonstrate local support for additional transit options.
      </li>
      <li id="t136a19s136-251ol113">
       Surveys have indicated broad public support for providing additional public transportation options and for allowing localities to generate revenue to match State grants.
