    A town may not, under its land use ordinance, require that all construction drawings submitted for approval be prepared and sealed by a licensed professional engineer, to the exclusion of licensed professional architects.

    Decision of the North Carolina Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors to suspend a surveyor’s license and to reprimand his surveying company was neither in excess of its statutory authority nor in violation of the law because the Board found that the surveyor did not perform his services in an ethical manner and was not truthful in all of his interactions with a property owner, thus falling short of the professional standards promulgated by the Board., 21 N.C. Admin. Code 56.0701(d)(1) and (g). In re Suttles Surveying, P.A., 227 N.C. App. 70, 742 S.E.2d 574,

    <b>
     Use of Word “Engineer” Does Not Represent Professional Engineering Status. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    It is clear from the definition in subdivision (8) that the use of the word “engineer” without being modified by “professional,” “registered” or “licensed,” or some word of like import does not represent that one is “duly registered and licensed by the Board” and therefore cannot represent that one is a professional engineer as that term is defined in subdivision (8). Since such usage does not represent professional engineering status, it cannot constitute the practice of engineering as that term is defined in paragraph (6)a.

     OPINIONS OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

   <p>
    <b>
     The specific provisions of subdivision (6) of this section should prevail over the more general provisions of G.S. 74C-3(a)(8);
    </b>
    to interpret Chapter 74C as requiring licensed professional engineers to obtain a private investigator’s license would defeat the intent of subdivision (6), which allows licensed professional engineers to conduct investigations. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Montgomery T. Speir, Executive Secretary, State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, 57 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 47 (Oct. 6, 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    The legislature has made it clear that licensed professional engineers need not be licensed as private investigators in order to engage in “investigation and consultation” that is included within the definition of the “practice of engineering” as defined by subdivision (6) of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Montgomery T. Speir, Executive Secretary, State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, 57 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 47 (Oct. 6, 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    The detailed drawings and accompanying calculations of street design and storm drainage systems, including subsurface systems and component structures, fall within the definition of the practice of engineering and not within the definition of landscape architecture. See opinion of Attorney General to Jerry T. Carter, Executive Director, N.C. Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors, 2001 N.C. AG LEXIS 8 (3/22/2001).

     Use of Word “Engineer” Does Not Represent Professional Engineering Status. —

   </p>
   <p>
    It is clear from the definition in subdivision (8) that the use of the word “engineer” without being modified by “professional,” “registered” or “licensed,” or some word of like import does not represent that one is “duly registered and licensed by the Board” and therefore cannot represent that one is a professional engineer as that term is defined in subdivision (8).

    The legislature has made it clear that licensed professional engineers need not be licensed as private investigators in order to engage in “investigation and consultation” that is included within the definition of the “practice of engineering” as defined by subdivision (6) of this section.

   </h3>
   <p>
    A State Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors, whose duty it is to administer the provisions of this Chapter, is created. The Board shall consist of four licensed professional engineers, three licensed professional land surveyors and two public members, who are neither professional engineers nor professional land surveyors. Of the land surveyor members, one and only one may hold dual licenses as a professional land surveyor and professional engineer. All of the members shall be appointed by the Governor. Appointments of the engineer and land surveyor members shall preferably, but not necessarily, be made from a list of nominees submitted by the professional societies for engineers and land surveyors in this State. Each member of the Board shall receive a certificate of appointment from the Governor and shall file with the Secretary of State a written oath or affirmation for the faithful discharge of the duties.
   </p>
   <p>
    Members of the Board serve for staggered five-year terms, and no member may be appointed for more than two full terms. Members serve until the expiration of their respective terms and until their respective successors are appointed. If a vacancy occurs during a term, the Governor shall appoint a successor from the same classification as the person causing the vacancy to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the vacancy is not filled within 90 days after it occurs, the Board may appoint a provisional member to serve until the appointment by the Governor becomes effective. The provisional member during his tenure has all the powers and duties of a regular member.

    Decision of the North Carolina Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors to suspend a surveyor’s license and to reprimand his surveying company was neither in excess of its statutory authority nor in violation of the law because the Board found that the surveyor did not perform his services in an ethical manner and was not truthful in all of his interactions with a property owner, thus falling short of the professional standards promulgated by the Board, 21 N.C. Admin. Code 56.0701(d)(1) and (g). In re Suttles Surveying, P.A., 227 N.C. App. 70, 742 S.E.2d 574,

    Certificates for licensure of corporations and business firms that engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying shall expire on the last day of the month of June following their issuance or renewal and shall become invalid on that date unless renewed. All other certificates for licensure shall expire on the last day of the month of December next following their issuance or renewal, and shall become invalid on that date unless renewed. When necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, the Board shall require any evidence necessary to establish the continuing competency of engineers and land surveyors as a condition of renewal of licenses. When the Board is satisfied as to the continuing competency of an applicant, it shall issue a renewal of the certificate upon payment by the applicant of a fee fixed by the Board but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00). The secretary of the Board shall notify by mail every person licensed under this Chapter of the date of expiration of the certificate, the amount of the fee required for its renewal for one year, and any requirement as to evidence of continued competency. The notice shall be mailed at least one month in advance of the expiration date of the certificate. Renewal shall be effected at any time during the month immediately following the month of expiration, by payment to the secretary of the Board of a renewal fee, as determined by the Board, which shall not exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00). Failure on the part of any licensee to renew the certificate annually in the month immediately following the month of expiration, as required above, shall deprive the licensee of the right to practice until reinstatement of the license. The license may be reinstated at anytime during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid by payment of a reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to the established renewal fee. Failure of a licensee to reinstate the license during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid shall require the individual, prior to resuming practice in North Carolina, to submit an application on the prescribed form, and to meet all other requirements for licensure as set forth in Chapter 89C. The secretary of the Board is instructed to remove from the official roster of engineers and land surveyors the names of all licensees who have not effected their renewal by the first day of the month immediately following the renewal period. The Board may adopt rules to provide for renewals in distress or hardship cases due to military service, prolonged illness, or prolonged absence from the State, where the applicant for renewal demonstrates to the Board that the applicant has maintained active knowledge and professional status as an engineer or land surveyor, as the case may be. It shall be the responsibility of each licensee to inform the Board promptly concerning change in address. A licensee may request and be granted inactive status. No inactive licensee may practice in this State unless otherwise exempted in this Chapter. A licensee granted inactive status shall pay annual renewal fees but shall not be subject to annual continuing professional competency requirements. A licensee granted inactive status may return to active status by meeting all requirements of the Board, including demonstration of continuing professional competency as a condition of reinstatement.

Renewal shall be effected at any time during the month immediately following the month of expiration, by payment to the secretary of the Board of a renewal fee, as determined by the Board, which shall not exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00). Failure on the part of any licensee to renew the certificate annually in the month immediately following the month of expiration, as required above, shall deprive the licensee of the right to practice until reinstatement of the license. The license may be reinstated at anytime during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid by payment of a reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to the established renewal fee. Failure of a licensee to reinstate the license during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid shall require the individual, prior to resuming practice in North Carolina, to submit an application on the prescribed form, and to meet all other requirements for licensure as set forth in Chapter 89C. The secretary of the Board is instructed to remove from the official roster of engineers and land surveyors the names of all licensees who have not effected their renewal by the first day of the month immediately following the renewal period. The Board may adopt rules to provide for renewals in distress or hardship cases due to military service, prolonged illness, or prolonged absence from the State, where the applicant for renewal demonstrates to the Board that the applicant has maintained active knowledge and professional status as an engineer or land surveyor, as the case may be. It shall be the responsibility of each licensee to inform the Board promptly concerning change in address. A licensee may request and be granted inactive status. No inactive licensee may practice in this State unless otherwise exempted in this Chapter. A licensee granted inactive status shall pay annual renewal fees but shall not be subject to annual continuing professional competency requirements. A licensee granted inactive status may return to active status by meeting all requirements of the Board, including demonstration of continuing professional competency as a condition of reinstatement.

     § 89C-24.
     Licensure of corporations and business firms that engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying.

   </h3>
   <p>
    A corporation or business firm may not engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying in this State unless it is licensed by the Board and has paid an application fee established by the Board in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). A corporation or business firm is subject to the same duties and responsibilities as an individual licensee. Licensure of a corporation or business firm does not affect the requirement that all engineering or land surveying work done by the corporation or business firm be performed by or under the responsible charge of individual registrants, nor does it relieve the individual registrants within a corporation or business firm of their design and supervision responsibilities. The Board may adopt rules regulating the operation of offices and places of business of corporations and business firms licensed under this section to ensure that professional engineering and land surveying services are performed under the supervision of licensed professional engineers and land surveyors.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section applies to every corporation that is engaged in the practice of engineering or land surveying, regardless of when it was incorporated. A corporation that is not exempt from Chapter 55B of the General Statutes by application of
