      Session Laws 2017-57, s. 11F.5A, provides: “It is the intent of the General Assembly to reduce avoidable emergency department readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health needs. To that end, of the funds appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) in nonrecurring funds for the 2017-2018 fiscal year shall be allocated for the development and establishment of a two-year pilot program at a hospital in Wake County to support a hospital-based, comprehensive community case management program. The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, in consultation with LME/MCOs responsible for the management and provision of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorder services in Wake County under the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver, shall oversee the development and establishment of the pilot program to ensure it is designed to reduce avoidable emergency department readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health needs. The pilot program shall be conducted at the hospital in Wake County with the largest number of emergency department visits that agrees to participate in the two-year pilot program authorized by this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      “By December 1, 2020, the Department shall submit a report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot program in reducing avoidable emergency department readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health needs.”

      <b>
       A county board of commissioners does not have the authority to increase the number of commissioners

      on a hospital authority located within the county. See opinion of Attorney General to William I. Millar, Attorney at Law, and Thomas S. Stukes, Smith Helms Mulliss &amp; Moore, L.L.P., 1999 N.C. AG LEXIS 39 (12/21/99).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section expressly grants the authority to expand the number of a hospital authority’s commissioners to the hospital authority’s commissioners themselves, rather than to the board of county commissioners; therefore, a resolution of a county board of commissioners which provided that the number of members to the board of commissioners of a hospital authority could not be changed except by resolution of the county board of commissioners was a nullity and had no force and effect. See opinion of Attorney General to Haywood Regional Medical Center, 1999 N.C. AG LEXIS 40 (12/21/99).

      <p>
       Session Laws 1983, c. 775, s. 3, provided: “Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unit of government, or units of government acting jointly, that as of December 31, 1983, is operating a hospital or hospitals pursuant to Articles 2 or 2A of Chapter 131 of the General Statutes may continue to operate pursuant to the provisions of those Articles as they existed on December 31, 1983, to the extent that those Articles are inconsistent with this Chapter. However, a unit of government that has been operating a hospital pursuant to those Articles may choose to continue operations under the provisions of one of the Parts of Article 2 of this Chapter by adopting an appropriate resolution and by satisfying all other requirements of the relevant Part of Article 2 of this Chapter.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 1989, c. 283, ss. 1 and 2, effective June 12, 1989, amended G.S. 131-7. Chapter 131 was repealed by Session Laws 1983, c. 775, s. 1, effective January 1, 1984. However, Session Laws 1983, c. 775, s. 3 contained a savings provision for certain units of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Session Laws 1989, c. 283, ss. 1 and 2 provided: “Section 1. G.S. 131-7, as it applies to hospitals continuing to operate under Article 2, Chapter 131 of the North Carolina General Statutes pursuant to Section 3, Chapter 775 of the 1983 Session Laws, is amended by rewriting the first sentence to read: ‘Should a majority of the qualified voters upon the question be in favor of establishing such county, township, or town hospital, the governing body shall proceed at once to appoint seven trustees chosen from the citizens at large with reference to their fitness for such office, all residents of the county, township or town, who shall constitute a board of trustees for such public hospital.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Sec. 2. G.S. 131-7 is amended by deleting the phrase ‘No practicing physician may serve as a trustee.’, and substituting ‘One practicing physician may serve as a trustee’.”

        Peer Review Committee. —

      <p>
       Hospital’s surgical peer review committee was a medical review committee within the meaning of G.S. 131E-76(5) because, according to the bylaws, the committee was a peer review committee of the surgical section and the composition and function of the committee as defined by the Bylaws met the definition of a medical review committee.

       Trial court erred by ordering hospitals to produce documents to a deceased patent’s estate because they demonstrated that the documents were privileged pursuant to the Hospital Licensure Act; the hospitals presented the affidavits of a director of medical staff services and medical staff bylaws to establish that their medical review committees (MRCs) qualified as MRCs pursuant to the meaning contemplated in the Act.

        Ambulatory Surgical Centers Included In Definition of Hospital. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court improperly concluded that hospitals were separate and legally distinct entities from ambulatory surgical centers because it erred in referring to the statute to define “hospital” as it was used in 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 410, § 33.(a), which regarded a fee schedule adopted by the Industrial Commission; the inclusion of ambulatory surgical centers in the definition of hospital, subjecting them to the Medicare methodology for hospital fee schedules, did not frustrate § 33.(a).

In short, so long as staff selections are administered with fairness, geared by a rationale compatible with hospital responsibility, and unencumbered with irrelevant considerations, a court should not interfere.

        Patient’s Freedom of Choice Is Subject to Hospital’s Staff Privilege Standards. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The right to enjoy hospital staff privileges is not absolute; it is subject to the standards set by the hospital’s governing body. This is implicit in the language of G.S. 90-202.12, especially in view of the policy of this State as currently stated by this section. G.S. 90-202.12 does not require a hospital to grant staff privileges regardless of the standards set by its board of trustees which are reasonably related to the operation of the hospital. Generally, the protection offered by G.S. 90-202.12 is for patients to have the freedom to choose a qualified “provider of care or service.” Cameron v. New Hanover Mem. Hosp., 58 N.C.

       Patient’s evidence of a hospital’s lien was admissible because, when the hospital chose to rely on the hospital’s lien on the patient’s expected judgment against an alleged tortfeasor instead of timely billing the patient’s health insurer, the hospital did not abandon the lien as (1) applicable statutes permitted this choice, and (2) a contrary interpretation frustrated the fair medical billing statute, which did not intend to force hospitals to bill insurers when other payment sources were available, so the patient remained indebted to the hospital under the medical lien statute.

       To the extent any questions a hospital director and nurse were ordered to answer were regarding information protected by the statute, the questions fell into the exception of the third category; by requiring responses to written interrogatories instead of oral answers, the trial court gave counsel the opportunity to ensure a witness did not inadvertently disclose information beyond the scope of the question asked, and the trial court did not err in requiring the non-privileged questions to be answered.

       “Adult care home”, as distinguished from a nursing home, means a facility operated as a part of a nursing home and which provides residential care for aged or disabled persons whose principal need is a home with the shelter or personal care their age or disability requires. Medical care in an adult care home is usually occasional or incidental, such as may be required in the home of any individual or family, but the administration of medication is supervised. Continuing planned medical and nursing care to meet the resident’s needs may be provided under the direct supervision of a physician, nurse, or home health agency. Adult care homes are to be distinguished from nursing homes subject to licensure under this Part.

A “nursing home” provides care for persons who have remedial ailments or other ailments, for which medical and nursing care are indicated; who, however, are not sick enough to require general hospital care.

No more than four county departments of social services shall participate in the pilot. The Division of Aging and Adult Services shall consider geographic balance and size in carrying out the pilot. At the conclusion of the pilot, the Division of Aging and Adult Services shall make recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the Quality Improvement Consultation Program for Adult Care Homes. If the Division recommends expansion of the pilot to other counties or statewide implementation of the Program, its report shall include the cost and a proposed timetable for implementing these recommendations, including the identification of any necessary statutory and administrative rule changes. The recommendations shall be made to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the North Carolina Study Commission on Aging, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, and the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Health and Human Services.”

      <li id="t131Ea06p01s131E-114.4ol10a">
       An offer of employment by a nursing home licensed under this Part to an applicant is conditioned on the applicant’s consent to an examination and screening for controlled substances. The examination and screening shall be conducted in accordance with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes. A screening procedure that utilizes a single-use test device may be used for the examination and screening of applicants and may be administered on-site. If the results of the applicant’s examination and screening indicate the presence of a controlled substance, the nursing home shall not employ the applicant unless and until the applicant provides to the nursing home written verification from the applicant’s prescribing physician that every controlled substance identified by the examination and screening is prescribed by that physician to treat the applicant’s medical or psychological condition. The verification from the physician shall include the name of the controlled substance, the prescribed dosage and frequency, and the condition for which the substance is prescribed. If the result of an applicant’s or employee’s examination and screening indicates the presence of a controlled substance, the nursing home may require a second examination and screening to verify the results of the prior examination and screening.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea06p01s131E-114.4ol10b">
       A nursing home may require random examination and screening for controlled substances as a condition of continued employment. If the nursing home has reasonable grounds to believe that an employee is an abuser of a controlled substance, the nursing home may require that employee to undergo examination and screening for controlled substances as a condition of continued employment.

       A nursing home and an officer or employee of a nursing home that, in good faith, comply with this section are not liable for the failure of the nursing home to employ or continue the employment of an individual on the basis of the results of an examination and screening of the applicant or employee for controlled substances.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea06p01s131E-114.4ol10d">
       An entity and officers and employees of an entity that perform controlled substance examination and screening in accordance with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes shall be immune from civil liability for conducting or failing to conduct the examination and screening if the examination and screening are requested and received in compliance with this section and with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes.

      <li id="t131Ea06p01s131E-114.4ol10e">
       The results of an examination and screening conducted at the request of a nursing home in accordance with this section are confidential and not a public record under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes. The nursing home shall maintain the confidentiality of all information related to the examination and screening of an applicant for employment or an individual currently employed by the nursing home.

       <b>
        The Nursing Home Patients’ Bill of Rights does not set the standard to which nursing homes are held accountable
       </b>
       in negligence damage actions. Such a holding would ignore the purpose of the negligence per se doctrine and the malpractice law of this State. It would permit the trier of fact to set its own standard of care for health care providers and speculate virtually without limits on the culpability of their conduct. Makas v. Hillhaven, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 736, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14932 (M.D.N.C. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nursing Home Patients’ Bill of Rights is a laudable statement of policy and requirements imposed on licensed nursing homes, with a remedial enforcement scheme which provides for injunctive relief and/or license revocation and administrative penalties. It may be relevant in a negligence case to show very generally a patient’s expectations from a nursing home, but it is not a substitute, through the doctrine of negligence per se, for the well-established standard of care to be applied in negligence actions for damages against health care providers. Makas v. Hillhaven, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 736, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14932 (M.D.N.C. 1984).

In a county which has one, two, or three nursing homes, the committee shall have five members.

       “Ambulatory surgical facility” means a facility designed for the provision of a specialty ambulatory surgical program or a multispecialty ambulatory surgical program. An ambulatory surgical facility serves patients who require local, regional or general anesthesia and a period of post-operative observation. An ambulatory surgical facility may only admit patients for a period of less than 24 hours and must provide at least one designated operating room as defined in subdivision (1c) of this section or at least one gastrointestinal endoscopy room as defined in subdivision (1b) of this section and at least one designated recovery room, have available the necessary equipment and trained personnel to handle emergencies, provide adequate quality assurance and assessment by an evaluation and review committee, and maintain adequate medical records for each patient. An ambulatory surgical facility may be operated as a part of a physician or dentist’s office, provided the facility is licensed under G.S. Chapter 131E, Article 6, Part 4, but the performance of incidental, limited ambulatory surgical procedures which do not constitute an ambulatory surgical program as defined in subdivision (1a) and which are performed in a physician or dentist’s office does not make that office an ambulatory surgical facility.

     <p>
      The Commission shall adopt rules to carry out the purpose of this Article. These rules shall be adopted with the advice of the State Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council and shall include the operation of a statewide trauma registry, statewide educational requirements fundamental to the implementation of the trauma system. The rules adopted by the Commission shall establish guidelines for monitoring and evaluating the system including standards and criteria for the denial, suspension, voluntary withdrawal, or revocation of credentials for trauma center designation, and the establishment of regional trauma peer review committees. Each regional trauma peer review committee shall be responsible for analyzing trauma patient care data and outcome measures to evaluate the ongoing quality of patient care, system performance, and medical direction within the regional trauma system. The committee membership shall include physicians, nurses, EMS personnel, trauma registrars, and hospital administrators. Review of medical records by the Trauma Peer Review Committee is confidential and protected under

     <p>
      With respect to collection of data and educational requirements regarding trauma, rules adopted by the Medical Care Commission shall limit the authority of the Department to hospitals and Emergency Medical Services providers. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted so as to grant the Department authority to require private physicians, schools, or universities, except those participating in the trauma system, to provide information or data or to conduct educational programs regarding trauma.

     Findings of fact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly of North Carolina makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol21">
       That the financing of health care, particularly the reimbursement of health services rendered by health service facilities, limits the effect of free market competition and government regulation is therefore necessary to control costs, utilization, and distribution of new health service facilities and the bed complements of these health service facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol22">
       That the increasing cost of health care services offered through health service facilities threatens the health and welfare of the citizens of this State in that citizens need assurance of economical and readily available health care.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol23">
       That, if left to the market place to allocate health service facilities and health care services, geographical maldistribution of these facilities and services would occur and, further, less than equal access to all population groups, especially those that have traditionally been medically underserved, would result.
       <p>
        <b>
         (3a)
        </b>
        That access to health care services and health care facilities is critical to the welfare of rural North Carolinians, and to the continued viability of rural communities, and that the needs of rural North Carolinians should be considered in the certificate of need review process.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol24">
       That the proliferation of unnecessary health service facilities results in costly duplication and underuse of facilities, with the availability of excess capacity leading to unnecessary use of expensive resources and overutilization of health care services.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol25">
       Repealed by Session Laws 1987, c. 511, s. 1.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol26">
       That excess capacity of health service facilities places an enormous economic burden on the public who pay for the construction and operation of these facilities as patients, health insurance subscribers, health plan contributors, and taxpayers.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol27">
       That the general welfare and protection of lives, health, and property of the people of this State require that new institutional health services to be offered within this State be subject to review and evaluation as to need, cost of service, accessibility to services, quality of care, feasibility, and other criteria as determined by provisions of this Article or by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to provisions of this Article prior to such services being offered or developed in order that only appropriate and needed institutional health services are made available in the area to be served.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol28">
       That because persons who have received exemptions under Section 11.9(a) of S.L. 2000-67, as amended, and under Section 11.69(b) of S.L. 1997-443, as amended by Section 12.16C(a) of S.L. 1998-212, and as amended by Section 1 of S.L. 1999-135, have had sufficient time to complete development plans and initiate construction of beds in adult care homes.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol29">
       That because with the enactment of this legislation, beds allowed under the exemptions noted above and pending development will count in the inventory of adult care home beds available to provide care to residents in the State Medical Facilities Plan.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol210">
       That because State and county expenditures provide support for nearly three-quarters of the residents in adult care homes through the State County Special Assistance program, and excess bed capacity increases costs per resident day, it is in the public interest to promote efficiencies in delivering care in those facilities by controlling and directing their growth in an effort to prevent underutilization and higher costs and provide appropriate geographical distribution.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol211">
       That physicians providing gastrointestinal endoscopy services in unlicensed settings should be given an opportunity to obtain a license to provide those services to ensure the safety of patients and the provision of quality care.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol212">
       That demand for gastrointestinal endoscopy services is increasing at a substantially faster rate than the general population given the procedure is recognized as a highly effective means to diagnose and prevent cancer.

Toward that end, of the funds appropriated from the Dorothea Dix Hospital Property Fund established under
       G.S. 143C-9-2(b1) to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the sum of eighteen million dollars ($18,000,000) shall be used to pay for any renovation or building costs associated with the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) The construction of new licensed short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds.

       “(b) The Secretary shall select hospitals in the three State regions for institutional services (Eastern Region, Central Region, and Western Region) to receive funds allocated under subsection (a) of this section for the construction, conversion, or both of short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds in rural areas of the State. Notwithstanding the State Medical Facilities Plan, Article 9 of Chapter 131E of the General Statutes, or any other provision of law to the contrary, each selected rural hospital that receives funds allocated under subsection (a) of this section shall be allowed to construct new or convert unused acute care beds into licensed, inpatient behavioral health beds without undergoing certificate of need review by the Division of Health Service Regulation. All newly constructed or converted beds shall be subject to existing licensure laws and requirements. As a condition of receiving these funds, each selected rural hospital shall reserve at least fifty percent (50%) of the constructed or converted beds for (i) purchase by the Department under the State-administered, three-way contract and (ii) referrals by local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) of individuals who are indigent or Medicaid recipients. Any hospital unit or other location with short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds constructed or converted with funds allocated under subsection (a) of this section shall be named in honor of Dorothea Dix.

       G.S. 131E-177(e1), as enacted by Section 12G.3 of this act, then the Secretary shall allocate funds to that hospital for the construction or conversion of a sufficient number of additional beds to ensure that, within the three-year period following approval of such request, the hospital has a total inventory of at least 18 licensed and operational short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds. Notwithstanding the State Medical Facilities Plan, Article 9 of Chapter 131E of the General Statutes, or any other provision of law to the contrary, these additional short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds shall be exempt from certificate of need review. The hospital unit or other location in which these additional short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds are located shall be named in honor of Dorothea Dix.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) Beginning November 1, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services shall annually report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division on the number and location of additional licensed short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds brought into operation with funds allocated under subsection (a) of this section. By December 1, 2020, the Department shall submit a report that includes a proposal for funding the recurring operating costs of these additional beds from a source or sources other than the Dorothea Dix Hospital Property Funds, including the identification of potential new funding sources.

       “(e) It is the intent of the General Assembly to increase the number of facility-based crisis centers in North Carolina for children and adolescents. Toward that end, of the funds appropriated from the Dorothea Dix Hospital Property Fund established under
       G.S. 143C-9-2(b1) to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) shall be used to award grants on a competitive basis for the establishment of up to two new facility-based crisis centers in the State for children and adolescents.

       The purpose behind enactment of the certificate of need law
       
       was to regulate health care, so that only those services which are needed and less costly but more effective are made available to the public. In re Denial of Request by Humana Hosp. Corp., 78 N.C. App. 637, 338 S.E.2d 139,

       Expansive interpretation proposed by the Department of Human Resources which allowed micro-management over relatively minor capital expenditures did not effectuate the overriding legislative intent behind the certificate of need process, i.e., regulation of major capital expenditures which may adversely impact the cost of health care services to the patient.

      <p>
       North Carolina’s certificate of need legislation shows that the North Carolina legislature was concerned about the unrelenting rise in the cost of health care, and about wasteful, duplicative major acquisitions by health care providers. North Carolina ex rel. Edmisten v. P.I.A. Asheville, Inc., 740 F.2d 274, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20469 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1003, 105 S. Ct. 1865, 85 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting the certificate of need law, the legislature found as facts that the forces of free market competition are largely absent in health care, and that government regulation is therefore necessary to control the cost, utilization, and distribution of health services and to assure that less costly and more effective alternatives are made available.

       Session Laws 1987, c. 511, s. 3, provided that the act, which amended this section, would become effective July 1, 1987, and would apply to all new institutional health services that are proposed on and after that date, but would not apply to applications for certificates of need which begin review, or to projects for which certificates of need were issued, before that date.

       The Certificate of Need (CON) Law defines a “capital expenditure” as an expenditure for a project, including but not limited to the cost of construction, engineering, and equipment which under generally accepted accounting principles is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance. Capital expenditure includes, in addition, the fair market value of an acquisition made by donation, lease, or comparable arrangement by which a person obtains equipment, the expenditure for which would have been considered a capital expenditure under this Article if the person had acquired it by purchase.

       An acquisition of equipment can occur by donation, lease, transfer or comparable arrangement.

     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-102, s. 2, provides: “The Department of Health and Human Services shall implement additional capitated 1915(b)(c) Medicaid waivers during the 2011-2012 fiscal year through a Request for Application (RFA) process for LME applicants who prove readiness. The Department shall consult with stakeholders during the approval process. The waiver program shall include all Medicaid-covered mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services. Expansion of the waiver is contingent upon approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-264, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2012-151, s. 13, provides: “(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) shall proceed with statewide restructuring of the management responsibilities for the delivery of services for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion authorized in this section, the Department shall do all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(1) Establish accountability for the development and management of a local system that ensures easy access to care, the availability and delivery of necessary services, and continuity of care for consumers in need of mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2) Maintain fidelity to the Piedmont Behavioral Health (PBH) demonstration model, a proven system for the operation of all public resources for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(3) Designate an area authority for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services to assume responsibility for all aspects of Waiver management. The following operational models are acceptable:
     </p>
     <p>
      “a. Merger model: A single larger LME is formed from the merger of two or more LMEs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “b. Interlocal agreement among LMEs: A single LME is identified as the leader for all Waiver operations, financial management, and accountability for performance measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(4) Use managed care strategies, including care coordination and utilization management, to reduce the trend of escalating costs in the State Medicaid program while ensuring medically necessary care and deploy a system for the allocation of resources based on the reliable assessment of intensity of need. The Department shall design these strategies to efficiently direct consumers to appropriate services and to ensure that consumers receive no more and no less than the amount of services determined to be medically necessary and at the appropriate funding level.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(5) As the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver expands statewide, phase out the current CAP-MR/DD Waiver as well as the utilization management functions currently performed by public and private contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(6) Design the Innovations Waiver in such a way as to serve the maximum number of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities within aggregate funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(7) Require LMEs approved to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver to do all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      “a. Maintain a local presence in order to respond to the unique needs and priorities of localities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “b. Implement a process for feedback end exchange of information and ideas to ensure communication with consumers, families, providers, and stakeholders regarding disability-specific and general Waiver operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “c. Establish and maintain systems for ongoing communication and coordination regarding the care of individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders with other organized systems such as local departments of social services, Community Care of North Carolina, hospitals, school systems, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and other community agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      “d. Comply with the following operational requirements:
     </p>
     <p>
      “1. Maintain disability specific infrastructure and competency to address the clinical, treatment, rehabilitative, habilitative, and support needs of all disabilities covered by the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver.
     </p>
     <p>
      “2. Maintain administrative and clinical functions, including requirements for customer service, quality management, due process, provider network development, information systems, financial reporting, and staffing.
     </p>
     <p>
      “3. Maintain full accountability for all aspects of Waiver operations and for meeting all contract requirements specified by the Department. The Department shall not require LMEs to subcontract any managed care functions or nonservice activities to other entities. However, LMEs that choose to subcontract managed care functions to other entities will be limited to the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      “I. Information systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      “II. Customer service (including call center) operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “III. Claims processing.
     </p>
     <p>
      “IV. Provider, enrollment, credentialing, and monitoring.
     </p>
     <p>
      “V. Professional services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “VI. Treatment Plan development.
     </p>
     <p>
      “VII. Referral to services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) By August 1, 2011, the Department shall select LMEs that have been assessed to meet minimum criteria for Waiver operations according to the requirements of RFA #2011-261 issued on April 1, 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) The Department shall require LMEs that have not been approved by the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver by January 1, 2013, to merge with or be aligned through an interlocal agreement with an LME that has been approved by the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. If any LME fails to comply with this requirement, or fails to meet performance requirements of an approved contract with the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver, the Department shall assign responsibility for management of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver on behalf of the noncompliant LME to an LME that is successfully operating the Waiver and successfully meeting performance requirements of the contract with the Department. Those LMEs approved to operate the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver under an interlocal agreement must have a single LME entity designated as responsible for all aspects of Waiver operations and solely responsible for meeting contract requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d) County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns associated with an area authority’s operation of a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns of Medicaid services associated with a county program or multicounty program’s operation of a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver beyond the county program or multicounty program’s Medicaid risk reserve and Medicaid fund balance amounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(e) Providers of targeted case management under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver are qualified to provide the 1915(c) service known as Community Guide under the Innovations Waiver. During the first year of assuming responsibility for Waiver operations, LMEs shall offer to contract with providers that were previously approved to provide targeted case management to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver, for the provision of Community Guide services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(f) By December 31, 2011, the Department shall determine the feasibility of adding habilitation services to the State Medicaid Plan through the 1915(i) Option as a strategy to address the needs of Medicaid enrollees with IDD who are not enrolled in the Innovations Waiver and are not residing in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF-MR facility).
     </p>
     <p>
      “(g) The Department shall consider the impact on ICF-MR facilities included in the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver to determine and, to the extent possible, minimize potential inconsistencies with the requirements of

     </p>
     <p>
      “(h) The Department shall discontinue the pilot program to administer the Supports Intensity Scale to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in non-Waiver LMEs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(i) The Department shall establish written policies ensuring alignment of objectives and operational coordination of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver and the care of individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders with other organized systems under the auspices of the Department, including Community Care of North Carolina.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(j) In the development of the budget for the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium and subsequent biennia, the General Assembly shall consider a reinvestment of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total projected State savings for that biennium from the operation of the 1915(b)/(c) Waiver, for the purpose of expanding the number of consumers served by the Innovations 1915(c) Medicaid Waiver, or for the purpose of expanding other services that are designed to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(k) By October 1, 2011, the Department, in coordination with the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, the Division of Medical Assistance, LMEs, PBH, and with stakeholder input, shall submit to the appropriate Oversight Committee of the General Assembly a strategic plan delineating specific strategies and agency responsibilities for the achievement of the objectives and deadlines set forth in this Act.

       When a hospice’s competitor contested the issuance of a “no review” letter to the hospice allowing the hospice to establish a branch facility in the county where the competitor operated, which was not the county in which the hospice currently operated, the hospice was not entitled to summary judgment because the hospice’s proposed branch was not within the hospice’s current planning and service area, so the hospice was required to obtain a certificate of need, and the issuance of a “no review” letter to the hospice substantially prejudiced the competitor, as it resulted in the establishment and licensure of “a new institutional health service” in the competitor’s service area without a prior determination of need.

       It was properly determined that a cancer treatment provider’s proposed acquisition of a linear accelerator did not require a certificate of need because the cost of the acquisition did not exceed the statutory threshold in G.S. 131E-176(14o) for the definition of “major medical equipment,” as (1) the cost of a related record and verify system was properly excluded from the acquisition cost, since the system was not essential to the operation of the accelerator, and (2) “general condition” costs and costs associated with building space to house a mechanical room and a mold room were properly excluded, as the accelerator did not increase “general condition” costs, and the construction costs were part of the developer’s base costs which were not attributable to the accelerator.

       Department of Health and Human Services did not violate the statute when it reviewed certificate-of-need applications in separate review periods because its schedules and review categories satisfied the statutory requirement that similar proposals in the same service area be reviewed together; the agency explained why proposals seeking to move dialysis stations across county lines were not “similar” to proposals merely relocating stations within a county under the medical plan established.

       Preliminary injunction enjoining medical providers from challenging a hospital’s Certificate of Need application was proper

Irreparable harm was shown by, among other things, the agreement itself, which stated that a breach would have resulted in irreparable harm. N.C. Baptist Hosp. v. Novant Health, Inc., 195 N.C.

       In enacting the certificate of need law, the legislature found as facts that the forces of free market competition are largely absent in health care, and that government regulation is therefore necessary to control the cost, utilization, and distribution of health services and to assure that less costly and more effective alternatives are made available.

       For purposes of an application for a certificate of need for a nursing facility, the administrative law judge properly determined that the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) had to utilize a look back period of 18 months preceding the date of the application’s submission through the date of the Agency’s decision in order that the Agency did not disregard several months of quality of care data the Agency specifically required the applicants to report.

      <p>
       The certificate of need law does not contemplate that the agency will review any criteria competitively, and subsequently find one applicant nonconforming to a criterion simply because another applicant is found conforming, as the intent of the legislature is to have the agency first ensure that each application comports with the statutory and regulatory criteria.

       Competitor showed no error in granting summary judgment for a certificate of need applicant’s application because (1) the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (Agency) did not wrongly consider only the project’s county, under G.S. 131E-183(a)(3), (3a), (4), and (6), as the statute stated no geographical scope, and the Agency used an established practice of applying the Administrative Code to fill this gap, so the Agency did not unreasonably interpret the statute, (2) the Agency’s incorporation by reference of findings regarding multiple criteria did not fail to independently review each criterion, and (3) the applicant adequately identified a funding source.

       Applicant for a certificate of need for a nursing facility did not purposefully exclude information concerning the quality of care record of its facilities outside of county because, although improper, the practice of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) in the past had been to only examine an applicant’s quality of care record within the service area of the proposed project.

       Administrative law judge erred in summarily concluding that the applicant for a certificate of need for a nursing facility was nonconforming with the criterion regarding past quality of care because the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) could have actually examined the quality of care provided by the applicant in the past as the applicant’s actual record of providing care was available to the Agency.

       When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Facility Services, Certificate of Need Section, denied a health system’s request for a certificate of need (CON) to build a hospital and granted a CON to the system’s competitor, competent evidence supported the agency’s finding that, even though the system had previously been granted a CON for a different project, the system was not going to complete that project, and a requirement that the agency “consider” the previously granted CON did not require the agency to find that the system would successfully develop the previously approved project and factor a hypothetical completed hospital into the agency’s determinations regarding the population to be served and the possibility of duplicative services.

       The Department of Health and Human Services’ finding that the successful Certificate of Need (CON) application conformed with subdivisions (a)(3), (4) and (6) of this section was supported by substantial evidence where the applicant identified 34 of its own patients at another facility who expressed a willingness to transfer their treatment to the proposed facility; where such transfer would not result in a duplication of services but rather better access for current patients; and where an evaluation of the alternatives—(1) relocating stations to develop a new facility at a new site, (2) expansion of the existing facility, and (3) doing nothing—revealed that opening a new center was the most effective alternative although the competing CON applicant already serviced a dialysis center in the city of the proposed new site.

       When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Facility Services, Certificate of Need Section, denied a health system’s request for a certificate of need (CON) to build a hospital and granted a CON to the system’s competitor, an administrative law judge was authorized to find that 10A N.C. Admin. Code 14C.2303(3), regarding findings of the utilization of computerized axial tomography equipment in a geographic area, was “void as applied” to the facts because the rule required consideration of the health system’s underutilization of such equipment in a hospital that was about to close in determining whether to authorize the competitor to install such equipment in the hospital the competitor proposed for the area, and the system’s underutilization was irrelevant to the area’s need for such equipment, and G.S. 150B-33(b)(9)(3) allowed the administrative law judge to find that a rule was void in a particular case because the rule was not reasonably necessary to enable an agency to fulfill a duty delegated to the agency by the general assembly.

        Operation of Legacy Medical Care Facility. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Statute contemplates two avenues to operating a Legacy Medical Care Facility (LMCF): acquire and operate or reopen and operate, and which is available stems from the entity’s legal right to the facility when the Certificate of Need was initially issued; administrative law judge erroneously held that an entity could evoke the statute to simply acquire a facility without an intent to actually operate it, but this is a legal nullity because the entity’s intent to operate is a previously addressed statutory component. FMSH L.L.C. v. N.C. HHS, 2021-NCCOA-451, 279 N.C. App. 157, 865 S.E.2d 666, 2021- NCCOA-451,

      </p>
      <p>
       Statute’s intent is to alleviate the need to undergo a minimally 125-day, investigatory review period before an entity may operate a healthcare facility in some circumstances and the Legacy Medical Care Facility exemption acknowledges that where an entity previously passed scrutiny, there is less risk that its new services will not pass scrutiny; written notice under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 131E-184(h) does not trigger the same regiment of comments, hearings, and extensive review that is necessitated under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 131E-185. FMSH L.L.C. v. N.C.

       Statute allows an entity to physically relocate the Legacy Medical Care Facility (LMCF) that it intends to acquire or reopen; After acquiring the subject LMCF, including the facility itself and the associated assets which were amassed under the scrutiny of Certificate of Need review, the operating entity may exercise its ownership rights and move its property to a new location.

       It was properly determined that a cancer treatment provider’s proposed acquisition of a linear accelerator did not require a certificate of need because the cost of the acquisition did not exceed the statutory threshold in G.S. 131E-176(14o) for the definition of “major medical equipment,” as (1) the cost of a related record and verify system was properly excluded from the acquisition cost, since the system was not essential to the operation of the accelerator, and (2) “general condition” costs and costs associated with building space to house a mechanical room and a mold room were properly excluded, as the accelerator did not increase “general condition” costs, and the construction costs were part of the developer’s base costs which were not attributable to the accelerator.

       Trial court did not err in dismissing appeal filed by hospital joint venture and a town in an action to permit the construction of a new hospital under the exemption provisions of G.S. 131E-184(a) where the hospital joint venture and the town failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by pursuing an administrative review hearing as provided by G.S. 131E-78(b)(1), the available administrative remedies were not inadequate to resolve the dispute, the plaintiffs failed to state an equal protection claim upon which relief could be granted in that they failed to allege the lack of a rational basis; and the complaint failed to meet the heightened standard required to overcome a regional hospital’s Noerr immunity after it commented against the issuance of a certificate of need to the building of a new hospital.

        Operation of Legacy Medical Care Facility. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Statute contemplates two avenues to operating a Legacy Medical Care Facility (LMCF): acquire and operate or reopen and operate, and which is available stems from the entity’s legal right to the facility when the Certificate of Need was initially issued; administrative law judge erroneously held that an entity could evoke the statute to simply acquire a facility without an intent to actually operate it, but this is a legal nullity because the entity’s intent to operate is a previously addressed statutory component. FMSH L.L.C. v. N.C. HHS, 2021-NCCOA-451, 279 N.C. App. 157, 865 S.E.2d 666, 2021- NCCOA-451,

      </p>
      <p>
       Statute’s intent is to alleviate the need to undergo a minimally 125-day, investigatory review period before an entity may operate a healthcare facility in some circumstances and the Legacy Medical Care Facility exemption acknowledges that where an entity previously passed scrutiny, there is less risk that its new services will not pass scrutiny; written notice under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 131E-184(h) does not trigger the same regiment of comments, hearings, and extensive review that is necessitated under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 131E-185. FMSH L.L.C. v. N.C.

       Statute allows an entity to physically relocate the Legacy Medical Care Facility (LMCF) that it intends to acquire or reopen; After acquiring the subject LMCF, including the facility itself and the associated assets which were amassed under the scrutiny of Certificate of Need review, the operating entity may exercise its ownership rights and move its property to a new location.

       It was properly determined that a cancer treatment provider’s proposed acquisition of a linear accelerator did not require a certificate of need because the cost of the acquisition did not exceed the statutory threshold in G.S. 131E-176(14o) for the definition of “major medical equipment,” as (1) the cost of a related record and verify system was properly excluded from the acquisition cost, since the system was not essential to the operation of the accelerator, and (2) “general condition” costs and costs associated with building space to house a mechanical room and a mold room were properly excluded, as the accelerator did not increase “general condition” costs, and the construction costs were part of the developer’s base costs which were not attributable to the accelerator.

       Trial court did not err in dismissing appeal filed by hospital joint venture and a town in an action to permit the construction of a new hospital under the exemption provisions of G.S. 131E-184(a) where the hospital joint venture and the town failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by pursuing an administrative review hearing as provided by G.S. 131E-78(b)(1), the available administrative remedies were not inadequate to resolve the dispute, the plaintiffs failed to state an equal protection claim upon which relief could be granted in that they failed to allege the lack of a rational basis; and the complaint failed to meet the heightened standard required to overcome a regional hospital’s Noerr immunity after it commented against the issuance of a certificate of need to the building of a new hospital.

       Statute’s intent is to alleviate the need to undergo a minimally 125-day, investigatory review period before an entity may operate a healthcare facility in some circumstances and the Legacy Medical Care Facility exemption acknowledges that where an entity previously passed scrutiny, there is less risk that its new services will not pass scrutiny; written notice under N.C.

       When a competitor contested the issuance of a “no review” letter to a hospice, which allowed the hospice to establish a branch in the competitor’s service area, and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Facility Services, ordered the withdrawal of the “no review” letter, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, under G.S. 131E-188(b), to hear the hospice’s appeal because a prior panel of the Court of Appeals held that the issuance of a “no review” letter was an “exemption” under G.S. 131E-188(a), and that holding was binding.

       Decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to award a certificate of need for new kidney dialysis machines to an applicant was affirmed as the agency’s findings were supported by sufficient evidence, and it did not exceed its statutory authority in using enhanced competition and consumer choice as key factors in a comparative analysis.
