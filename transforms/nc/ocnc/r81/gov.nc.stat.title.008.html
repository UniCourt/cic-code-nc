        And Description Must Identify Land or Refer to Source of Identification. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute applies only when there is a description which can be aided by parol, and cannot be held to validate a deed where the description is too vague and indefinite to identify the land claimed and to fit it to the description. At all events, the description as it may be explained by oral testimony must identify and make certain the land intended to be conveyed. Failing in this, the deed is void. Holloman v. Davis,

      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory rule permitting the use of parol testimony to fit the description in the deed to the land intended to be conveyed does not relieve the invalidity due to vagueness, indefiniteness and uncertainty unless there are elements of description which are either certain in themselves or are capable of being reduced to certainty by reference to something extrinsic, to which the deed refers. The liberal rule of construction does not permit the passing of title to land by parol. Such evidence cannot be used to enlarge the scope of the descriptive words. The deed itself must point to the source from which evidence aliunde to make the description complete is to be sought. Holloman v. Davis,
       <cite class="nc_code">

Whether relying upon their deeds as proof of title or of color of title, they were required to locate the land by fitting the description in the deeds to the earth’s surface and showing that such deeds embraced the land in controversy. In the absence of title or color of title, they were required to establish the known and visible lines and boundaries of the land actually occupied for the statutory period. Midgett v.

       Superior court erred, inter alia, in denying a loan assignee’s motion for summary judgment in its quiet title action because the deed of trust adequately described the property to create a lien on that property without the need for reformation and also identified the real estate securing the loan by its correct street address and tax parcel number, and the owner could, and did, encumber the property when he obtained the loan from the assignee’s predecessor where several deeds in the owner’s chain of title, including the deed conveying the property to him, all included the same legal description as the deed of trust, with no reference to the book and page number of the subdivision’s map in the county’s Map Book.

      </p>
      <p>
       A hospital record is a business record, and is admissible into evidence upon the laying of a proper foundation. A proper foundation consists of testimony from a hospital librarian or custodian of the records or other qualified witness as to the identity and authenticity of the record and the mode of its preparation, including testimony that the entries were made at or near the time of the act or event recorded, that the entries were made by persons having personal knowledge of the event or act, and that the entries were made ante litem motam. The court, however, should exclude from jury consideration entries which amount to hearsay on hearsay. Donavant v. Hudspeth, 75 N.C. App. 321, 330 S.E.2d 517, rev’d on other grounds,

        Authenticating Hospital Records. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This section merely eliminated the necessity of taking original hospital records to court, where they were often kept for long periods to the dismay of record keepers and the inconvenience of those who needed to use the records for any purpose, including the later treatment of the patient. It did not modify the then-existing process of authenticating hospital records but, to the contrary, it ratified and reinforced the process by continuing to require authenticating testimony. In re Will of Cromartie, 64 N.C. App. 115, 306 S.E.2d 853,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        1983 N.C. App. LEXIS 3221
       </cite>
       (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to authenticating hospital records is not personal knowledge by anyone of particular entries or occurrences, but evidence of system and practice; evidence that a business-like system of compiling records exists, which requires that entries be made at or near the time involved by those who examine, observe, test and treat patients; and that in practice the system is generally followed. When that is testified to by someone familiar with the system, and the purported record involved is testified to be genuine, the authenticating process is complete. In re Will of Cromartie, 64 N.C. App. 115, 306 S.E.2d 853,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       It is a matter of common knowledge among those familiar with hospital records that entries requiring dictation and transcription are done late by many doctors because they give priority to their other medical duties. Nevertheless, such entries, when regularly made, are still parts of the patients’ record and should be so considered, except when there is evidence of duplicity or bad faith.

        Mental Health Records Previously Admitted Into Evidence. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by considering mental health records of a mother contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence in proceedings to terminate her parental rights, because the mental health records challenged by the mother were originally admitted into evidence during a permanency planning review hearing and were not challenged by the mother at that time.

       It is not required that the authenticating proof be only by personal knowledge.
       
       Such a requirement would, for all intents and purposes, abrogate the use of business records in court; because under the conditions that most businesses and hospitals are conducted today, it is a rare person indeed, that has personal knowledge of any work or undertaking done by others.

       In an action to recover for labor and materials supplied by plaintiff in repairing defendant’s truck, plaintiff’s exhibit which consisted of itemized statements of account for materials supplied and labor performed by plaintiff upon defendant’s truck was not admissible pursuant to this section because it was not verified; however, the exhibit was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule where there was testimony that the exhibit properly reflected the work done by plaintiff’s shop foreman and charges made pursuant to the work he performed.

       Because the mortuary table is only evidentiary, the cash value of dower inchoate depended on the ages of husband and wife, and on their health, habits and all other circumstances tending to show the probabilities as to the length of life; there is no reason for differing rules for determining life expectancy as between married women entitled to dower inchoate and widows entitled to dower consummate.

       In the absence of a request, the judge did not commit reversible error in failing to instruct the jury in an action for personal injury that the plaintiff had a life expectancy of 15.27 years according to the mortuary table, which he had introduced in evidence, where, although the charge did not contain a direct reference to the plaintiff’s life expectancy, the court did instruct the jury to take into consideration all the evidence bearing on the issue, including the plaintiff’s age.

      The present cash value of the annuity for a fraction of a year may be ascertained as follows: Multiply the difference between the cash value of the annuities for the preceding and succeeding full years by the fraction of the year in decimals and add the sum to the present cash value for the preceding full year. When a person is entitled to the use of a sum of money for life, or for a given time, the interest thereon for one year, computed at four and one half percent (4 1/2%), may be considered as an annuity and the present cash value be ascertained as herein provided: Provided, the interest rate in computing the present cash value of a life interest in land shall be six percent (6%).

       This section abolishes the common-law rule
       
       which prevented a party who was interested in the result of the verdict and judgment from appearing as a witness. A similar enactment will be found in the statutes of practically all the states. The trend of the development of the rules of evidence has been to remove personal disqualification to testify.

       An accomplice could not testify on direct examination to facts tending to incriminate defendant and at the same time refuse to answer questions on cross-examination relating to matters embraced in his examination-in-chief, and where he refused to answer relevant questions on cross-examination on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him, it was error for the court to refuse defendant’s motion that his testimony-in-chief be stricken from the record, the refusal to answer the questions on cross-examination rendering the testimony-in-chief incompetent.

        In the trial of any civil action in which the question of parentage arises, the court shall, on motion of a party, order the mother, the child, and the alleged father-defendant to submit to one or more blood or genetic marker tests, to be performed by a duly certified physician or other expert. The court shall require the person requesting the blood or genetic marker tests to pay the costs of the tests. The court may, in its discretion, tax as part of costs the expenses for blood or genetic marker tests and comparisons. Verified documentary evidence of the chain of custody of the blood specimens obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be competent evidence to establish the chain of custody. Any party objecting to or contesting the procedures or results of the blood or genetic marker tests shall file with the court written objections setting forth the basis for the objections and shall serve copies thereof upon all other parties not less than 10 days prior to any hearing at which the results may be introduced into evidence. The person contesting the results of the blood or genetic marker tests has the right to subpoena the testing expert pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure. If no objections are filed within the time and manner prescribed, the test results are admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The results of the blood or genetic marker tests shall have the following effect:

       Before a court is required to order a blood-grouping test in a civil action, the question of paternity must arise.

      <p>
       “Dying declarations” by the person whose death is an issue in the case have long been admissible in North Carolina provided (1) at the time they were made the declarant was in actual danger of death; (2) he had full apprehension of the danger; (3) death did in fact ensue; and (4) declarant, if living, would be a competent witness to testify to the matter. In 1973, the General Assembly codified the essentials of those requirements in this section. State v. Stevens,

       , 228 S.E.2d 414 (1976), and in State v. Cousin,

        291 N.C. 413
       </cite>
       , 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976), it was noted, without deciding, that the words “no hope of recovery” in the statute might make the statutory exception to the hearsay rule more restrictive than existing case law. The Supreme Court concluded that the statutory prerequisites that the deceased must have been “conscious of approaching death and believed that there was no hope of recovery” did not change the case-law requirements that in order to be admissible the declarations of a decedent must have been “in present anticipation of death.” State v. Stevens,
       <cite class="nc_code">

       The statutory prerequisites that the deceased must have been “conscious of approaching death and believed that there was no hope of recovery” did not change case-law requirements that in order to be admissible the declaration of a decedent must have been “in present anticipation of death.” It was enough if he “believed he was going to die.” State v. Penn, 36 N.C. App. 482, 244 S.E.2d 702,
       <cite class="nc_code">

        Rationale Based on Trustworthiness of Declaration. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The rationale of this section clearly rests upon a belief in the general trustworthiness of dying declarations, rather than upon the necessity for bringing to justice the perpetrators of secret homicides. State v. Lester,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        294 N.C. 220
       </cite>
       , 240 S.E.2d 391, 1978
       <cite class="nc_code">
        N.C. LEXIS 1226
       </cite>
       (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common law and statutory requirement of “no hope of recovery” rests upon the tenet that when an individual believes death to be imminent, the ordinary motives for falsehood are absent and most powerful considerations impel him to speak the truth. The solemnity of approaching death is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a court of justice. State v. Stevens,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        295 N.C. 21
       </cite>
       , 243 S.E.2d 771, 1978

       </cite>
       (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The public necessity of preventing secret homicides from going unpunished
       
       requires the preservation of dying declarations as evidence, notwithstanding the inability of the defendant to cross-examine his accuser. State v. Stevens,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        295 N.C. 21

        Section Expands the Admissibility of Statements. —

       The overall effect of this section was to liberalize the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule by expanding the admissibility of such statements to all civil and criminal trials. State v. Lester,

        Declarant’s Death Need Not Be in Issue. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Admissibility seems no longer to be confined to situations in which the declarant’s death is in issue, but rather extends to any situation in which the cause or circumstances of the declarant’s death may be relevant to any issue in litigation. State v. Lester,
       <cite class="nc_code">

       It is not necessary that the declarant should be in the very act of dying;
       
       it is enough if he is under the apprehension of impending dissolution. Stated in simpler terms, it is enough if he believed he was going to die. State v. Stevens,

        And Test Is Not Actual Swiftness with Which Death Ensues. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the declarant survived one week longer than the doctor had told him he might live did not affect the admissibility of his dying declarations. The test is the declarant’s belief in the nearness of death when he made the statement, not the actual swiftness with which death ensued. State v. Stevens,

       It is not necessary for the declarant to state that he perceives he is going to die.
       
       If all the circumstances, including the nature of the wound, indicate that the declarant realized death was near, this requirement of the law is satisfied. State v. Bowden,

       The consciousness of approaching death may be made to appear from what the injured person said; or from the nature and extent of the wounds inflicted, being obviously such that he must have felt or known that he could not survive; as well as from his conduct at the time and the communications, if any, made to him by his medical advisers, if assented to or understandingly acquiesced in by him.

       The party seeking admission of the out-of-court statement need not show that the declarant stated he had given up all hope of living or considered himself to be in the throes of death. All that must be shown is that the declarant believes he is going to die. This belief is best shown by his express communication to this effect. However, it is not necessary that declarant personally express his belief that he has no chance of recovery. This may be shown by the circumstances. State v. Hamlette,

       The admissibility of a declaration as a dying declaration is a question to be determined by the trial judge,

       Once admitted into evidence, a dying declaration is no different from other testimony. The extent of its credibility is a matter for the jury and it is subject to impeachment or corroboration upon the same grounds and in the same manner as the testimony of a sworn witness. State v. Stevens,

       The fact that the dying declarations were made in response to leading questions did not require their exclusion from evidence. The qualifying questions were not perfunctory to be used in the event the dying man took a turn for the worse, but were clearly appropriate in light of the declarant’s severe injuries and inability to speak, and the declarations were as nearly spontaneous as declarations by one under the circumstances could be.

        Impeachment of Dying Declaration. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The impeachment of a dying declaration must proceed under the ordinary rules of evidence. Under these rules, for the purpose of impeachment, a party is entitled to introduce evidence only of the general reputation or character of the witness. Therefore, the courts do not permit the witness to be impeached by independent evidence of particular misconduct. Specifically, this means that a witness may not be impeached by record evidence of his conviction of crime. State v. Stevens,

       Evidence of the general character or reputation of a decedent is relevant on the issue of his dying declaration and is admissible to impeach or to sustain the declaration.

        While a patient does not waive his right to assert that a communication between himself and his physician is privileged by merely testifying as to his own physical condition, where the patient voluntarily goes into detail regarding the nature of his injuries, he waives the privilege, and the physician is competent and compellable to testify in regard thereto, since the patient will not be allowed to close the mouth of the only witness in a position to contradict him and fully explain the facts.

        A patient may surrender his privilege in a personal injury case by testifying to the nature and extent of his injuries and the examination and treatment by the physician or surgeon. Whether the testimony of the patient amounts to a waiver of privilege depends upon the provisions of the applicable statute and the extent and ultimate materiality of the testimony given with respect to the nature, treatment, and effect of the injury or ailment. The question of waiver is to be determined largely by the facts and circumstances of the particular case on trial. Neese v. Neese, 1 N.C. App. 426, 161 S.E.2d 841,

        so as to give effect to the obvious intention of the legislature as manifested in the entire act and other acts in pari materia, the language of both of these sections is sufficient to allow the trial court to compel disclosure prior to trial and prior to the filing of criminal charges when such action is necessary to the exercise of its implied or inherent powers to provide for the proper administration of justice.

        Before a physician may testify to matters arising in his confidential relationship with his patient, this section requires that the trial judge find that in his opinion such testimony is “necessary to a proper administration of justice,” and in the absence of such finding appearing of record on appeal, it is reversible error for the trial judge upon defendant’s exception to admit testimony of the insured’s physician tending to show that the insured in his application for life insurance had made misstatements of material facts that would avoid the insurer’s liability in his suit to cancel the policy issued thereon.

         Change from Common Law. —

       </p>
       <p>
        To correctly interpret and apply this section, it should be remembered that at common law, both in England and in this country, parties were not competent witnesses and were not permitted to testify. Nonetheless, an admission of guilt by defendant was competent evidence just as it is competent today. Then, as now, the law applied and gave effect to the assumption that one charged with crime and wrongful conduct would not remain silent when he had an opportunity to speak. Such silence was evidence of guilt. Thus, when the barrier was removed preventing the accused from testifying and according him a privilege, it was proper to provide that his failure to utilize the privilege so given should not be regarded as an implied admission. State v. Walker,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         251 N.C. 465

       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the adoption of this section defendants in criminal actions were not competent to testify in their own behalf. The prevailing theory prior to the adoption of this section was that the frailty of human nature and the overpowering desire for freedom would ordinarily induce a person charged with crime, if permitted to testify, to swear falsely. State v. Williams, 6 N.C. App. 611, 170 S.E.2d 640,
        <cite class="nc_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        When the common-law rules of evidence, which declared that parties were incompetent to testify, were changed by this section, an important privilege was extended to defendants, guarded by the provision that a failure to exercise it should raise no presumption of guilt against them. State v. Smith,

        This section gives a criminal defendant the privilege of testifying in his own behalf. It is not his duty to do so, and he cannot be compelled to testify.

The reason for the rule is that extended comment from the court or from counsel for the State or defendant would tend to nullify the declared policy of the law that the failure of one charged with crime to testify in his own behalf should not create a presumption against him or be regarded as a circumstance indicative of guilt or unduly accentuate the significance of his silence.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts first-degree murder on the bases of felony murder and of malice, premeditation and deliberation and, after a capital sentencing proceeding, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial erred by failing to intervene ex mero motu to exclude comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The prosecution responded to defendant’s attacks on two individuals and made permissible comments on defendant’s failure to produce witnesses or exculpatory evidence to contradict or refute evidence presented by the State; the prosecution’s remarks did not constitute a direct reference to his failure to testify and did not require a curative instruction.

        A charge to the effect that a defendant has a right not to testify and that his failure to testify should not be considered as a circumstance against him will not be held for error on the ground that it called to the jury’s attention the fact of defendant’s absence from the stand.

        No hard and fast form of expression or consecrated formula is required, but the jury may be instructed that, as to the defendant, the jury should scrutinize his testimony in the light of his interest in the outcome of the prosecution, but that if after such scrutiny the jury believes that the witness has told the truth, it should give his testimony the same weight it would give the testimony of any other credible witness. It was not mandatory that the judge charge the jury in this respect, but the charge was permissible and appeared to be the uniform practice. State v. Williams, 6 N.C. App. 611, 170 S.E.2d 640,

        The trial judge’s statement in his charge to the jury did not constitute prejudicial error where the charge, taken as a whole, did not give the jury the impression that defendant’s failure to present evidence was to be taken against him. State v. Harlow, 16 N.C. App. 312, 191 S.E.2d 900,

        Although it is the better practice to give no instruction concerning the failure of defendant to testify unless he requests it, the trial court’s instruction in a first degree murder case to the effect that defendant’s failure to testify should not be considered by the jury was not prejudicial to defendant.

        Where an instruction was unduly repetitious, but stripped of unnecessary verbiage the instruction was that a defendant may or may not testify in his own behalf as he sees fit, and that his failure to testify shall not be held against him to any extent, this instruction met the requirements of this section.

        Trial judge’s instruction to the jury that they “should” not consider defendant’s failure to take the stand against him, rather than that they “shall” not consider his failure to take the stand against him, was not error. State v. Sellers,

        While the interpretations of this section require defendant’s testimony to be scrutinized, it was the province of the jury to determine from his demeanor and the attending circumstances the weight which they would accord his testimony, and a charge of the court that “the law presumes” that he is naturally laboring under the temptation to testify to whatever he thinks may be necessary to clear himself and that the jury should take into consideration what a conviction would mean to defendant, etc., was held to impose a burden and cast a shadow upon his testimony greater than the law required and constituted reversible error.

        While it is proper for the court to instruct the jury to scrutinize testimony of a defendant in a criminal prosecution because of his interest in the verdict, it was error for the court to fail to follow such instructions with a charge that if after such scrutiny the jury found him worthy of belief they should give his testimony as full credit as they would that of any other witness.

         Applicability of Section to Common-Law Marriages. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Common-law marriages are invalid in North Carolina. Hence, the husband-wife testimonial privilege granted in this section may not be asserted by a criminal defendant to disqualify a witness alleged to be his spouse by virtue of a common-law marriage contracted in North Carolina. This State, however, will recognize as valid a common-law marriage if the acts alleged to have created it took place in a state in which such a marriage is valid. State v. Alford,

        Under subsection (b) of this section, the privilege belongs to the spouse, not to the defendant. Once challenged, the better practice is for the trial judge to advise the spouse that he or she cannot be compelled to testify in cases where this statute applies, and then to determine whether the spouse is in fact still willing to testify.

        Where in response to the officer’s inquiry as to whether the defendant had a knife, the jury was informed that the defendant’s wife left the room and returned with a pocket knife, identified as State’s Exhibit Number 3, this conduct was equivalent to the wife stating, “Yes, the defendant has a knife, and here it is.” Thus, the court committed prejudicial error in allowing the police officer to testify to the wife’s actions.

        During the absence of the judge, the solicitor (now district attorney) in his argument to the jury called the jury’s attention to the fact that defendant’s wife had not testified in his behalf, and persisted in the argument after objection by defendant’s counsel. Upon his return, the judge sustained the objection, and near the conclusion of his charge to the jury stated that the law did not permit such comment and that the jury should not let the argument influence it. The solicitor’s (district attorney’s) comment violated this section, and was prejudicial, and called for prompt peremptory and certain caution by the court, not only that the argument should be disregarded, but that the failure of defendant’s wife to testify should not be considered to his prejudice, and the action of the court in merely sustaining the objection and the caution later given by the court near the conclusion of the charge was insufficient to free the case of prejudice.

       § 8-57.2.
     Presumed father or mother as witnesses where paternity at issue.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever an issue of paternity of a child born or conceived during a marriage arises in any civil or criminal proceeding, the presumed father or the mother of such child is competent to give evidence as to any relevant matter regarding paternity of the child, including nonaccess to the present or former spouse, regardless of any privilege which may otherwise apply. No parent offering such evidence shall thereafter be prosecuted based upon that evidence for any criminal act involved in the conception of the child whose paternity is in issue and/or for whom support is sought, except for perjury committed in this testimony.

       Whenever an issue of hospital, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or funeral charges arises in any civil proceeding, the injured party or his guardian, administrator, or executor is competent to give evidence regarding the amount paid or required to be paid in full satisfaction of such charges, provided that records or copies of such charges showing the amount paid or required to be paid in full satisfaction of such charges accompany such testimony.
      </li>
      <li id="t08a07s8-58.1ol11b">
       The testimony of a person pursuant to subsection (a) of this section establishes a rebuttable presumption of the reasonableness of the amount paid or required to be paid in full satisfaction of the charges. However, in the event that the provider of hospital, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or funeral services gives sworn testimony that the charge for that provider’s service either was satisfied by payment of an amount less than the amount charged, or can be satisfied by payment of an amount less than the amount charged, then with respect to that provider’s charge only, the presumption of the reasonableness of the amount charged is rebutted and a rebuttable presumption is established that the lesser satisfaction amount is the reasonable amount of the charges for the testifying provider’s services. For the purposes of this subsection, the word “provider” shall include the agent or employee of a provider of hospital, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or funeral services, or a person with responsibility to pay a provider of hospital, medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or funeral services on behalf of an injured party.

       The fact that a provider charged for services provided to the injured person establishes a permissive presumption that the services provided were reasonably necessary but no presumption is established that the services provided were necessary because of injuries caused by the acts or omissions of an alleged tortfeasor.

       Session Laws
       2011-19, s. 3, provides: “The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) shall encourage and seek collaborative opportunities and grant funds for research programs, in association, whenever possible, with the university system or independent nationally recognized forensic institutions, on human observer bias and sources of human error in forensic examinations. Such programs might include studies to determine the effects of contextual bias in forensic practice (e.g., studies to determine whether and to what extent the results of forensic analysis are influenced by knowledge regarding the background of the suspect and the investigator’s theory of the case). In addition, research on sources of human error should be closely linked with research conducted to quantify and characterize the amount of error. Based on the results of these studies, and in consultation with the North Carolina Forensic Sciences Advisory Board, the North Carolina State Crime Laboratory should develop standard operating procedures (that will lay the foundation for model protocols) to minimize, to the extent possible, potential bias and sources of human error in forensic science. These standard operating procedures should apply to all forensic analyses that may be used in litigation.”

       Session Laws
       2021-180, s. 16.17(a), provides: “The General Assembly finds all of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) All criminal defendants have the right to court proceedings free from unreasonable delay, a right that is in jeopardy due to a perpetual district court case backlog, one which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) All criminal defendants have the right to court proceedings free from unreasonable delay, a right that is jeopardized when a district court case backlog exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) The North Carolina court system is bifurcated into the district and superior courts, and due to this bifurcation, the district courts function essentially as a preliminary proceeding that assures that the prosecution of a criminal defendant proceeds without the unreasonable delay that would be unavoidable if the district courts did not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) The bifurcation of the North Carolina court system provides a criminal defendant with the unique opportunity to a "second bite of the apple" in the defendant's case.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) In superior court a defendant may exercise the defendant's right to a trial by jury, along with other rights, the exercise of which is unavailable in district court.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) The legal protections from being placed twice in jeopardy for the same conduct preclude the State from appealing an unfavorable outcome at trial in district court.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(7) A criminal defendant in a case before the district court may request, prior to trial, to have the case transferred to the superior court and may appeal to the superior court for a trial de novo following a final disposition in district court, retaining all rights that had previously been afforded the criminal defendant in district court.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(8) Though preliminary in nature, a district court can issue a final and binding disposition in a case before it.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(9) In a criminal proceeding in district court, the finder of fact is the district court judge presiding over the proceeding, who is legally trained to weigh the credibility, relevance, and veracity of evidence, including witness testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(10) Simultaneous, two-way audio and video remote testimony in real time using state of the art technology allows a defendant to observe and cross-examine a witness, a district court judge to observe and question a witness to weigh the credibility and veracity of the witness's testimony, and a witness to observe a defendant against whom the witness is testifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(11) A witness in any court proceeding is one who, being duly sworn or affirmed, testifies as to the witness's knowledge of specific facts relevant to the case for which the witness testifies.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(12) A forensic or chemical analyst, and each person in the chain of custody of evidence produced by the analyst, does not play a role in initiating a criminal charge against a criminal defendant or in deciding whether or not to prosecute a criminal defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(13) The testimony of a forensic or chemical analyst is based upon objective, scientifically based testing that allows the analyst to reach dispassionate conclusions that may be presumed reliable and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(14) The testimony of a witness called to establish the chain of custody of evidence is not adversarial in nature and merely conveys the fact of a ministerial function performed by the witness in the course of the witness's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(15) In order to safeguard a criminal defendant's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, it is reasonable and prudent to allow forensic and chemical analysts, and each person in the chain of custody of evidence produced by the analysts, to provide real-time, remote, two-way audio and video testimony before the district courts of this State using state of the art technology and equipment that enable the criminal defendant, the judge, and the attorneys in the case to observe the demeanor of the forensic analyst throughout the direct examination and cross-examination of the forensic analyst and that enable the forensic analyst to likewise observe the demeanor of the criminal defendant.”

       “”From session to session” means that first there must be a “”session” of court at which a particular case is scheduled to be heard to trigger compulsory attendance for that case; from that point onward, a properly subpoenaed witness is required to appear “from session to session” for that case until discharged. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court committed a prejudicial error when it ordered defense counsel’s legal assistant to appear as a witness; the assistant was directed to appear for specific dates, and the trial court did not hold a session of court at which this case was calendared on Friday, November 8, 2013.

       A deposition taken under this section is competent to be read in favor of one prisoner, although it contains testimony charging his codefendant with committing the crime. When so read, it is the duty of the presiding judge to instruct the jury that they are not to consider it as evidence against the codefendant thus charged with the crime, but only as evidence in favor of the prisoner who offers it.

        Preservation of Exception. —

       Where a commissioner to take depositions has, over the objection and exceptions of a party litigant, denied him the right of cross-examination of a witness of his opponent, and the litigant has appealed therefrom to the trial court, and preserved his right, the exception gives notice of the grounds upon which it was based, and on his motion on the trial, the deposition relating to that part of the evidence will be stricken.

       Trial court did not err in admitting the photographs of defendant and his tattoos taken at the jail after his arrest as there was no authentication issue with the photographs because the custodial photographs did not purport to show defendant’s arm at the time of the robbery; and defendant did not contest that the photographs fairly and accurately depicted his arm while he was in custody.

       Where victim testified that the videotape was a factual representation of the events on the night of the robbery, the business had installed the camera approximately six weeks before the robbery, and that the camera was working properly before and after the night of the robbery, and on voir dire a police department detective testified that he had exclusive care and custody of the video camera film since the night of the robbery, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to find that the State had laid a proper foundation to introduce the videotape into evidence for either substantive or illustrative purposes.
