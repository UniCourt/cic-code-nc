    <li id="t89Es89E-6ol11">
     Persons engaged solely in teaching the science of geology or engaged solely in geologic research in this State may pursue their teaching and/or research without licensing.

     OPINIONS OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The North Carolina Board for Licensing of Geologists has the authority to investigate written charges that a geologist, licensed in North Carolina, has violated the Code of Professional Conduct; after such investigation, the Board may refuse to grant or renew, or may suspend or may revoke the license of any geologist licensed under the Act who has violated the Code, including a State official or employee performing his or her assigned duties.
    However, a State official or employee who loses his license for violations of the Code is still exempt from the provisions of the Act, and thus would not be prevented from practicing geology for the State without a license should the agency decide to retain him.

   <p>
    The North Carolina Board for Licensing of Geologists has the authority to investigate written charges that a geologist, licensed in North Carolina, has violated the Code of Professional Conduct; after such investigation, the Board may refuse to grant or renew, or may suspend or may revoke the license of any geologist licensed under the Act who has violated the Code, including a State official or employee performing his or her assigned duties.
    However, a State official or employee who loses his license for violations of the Code is still exempt from the provisions of the Act, and thus would not be prevented from practicing geology for the State without a license should the agency decide to retain him.
