      <p>
       A person has sufficient testamentary capacity within the meaning of the law if he comprehends the natural objects of his bounty, understands the kind, nature, and extent of his property, knows the manner in which he desires his act to take effect, and realizes the effect his act will have upon his estate.

        Burden of Proving Lack of Mental Capacity. —

      <p>
       Wherever one alleges that the maker of a will did not have sufficient mental capacity to make it, then the burden is upon such person to satisfy the jury by the greater weight of the evidence of the truth of his contention and to overcome the presumption of sanity after the formal execution has been established.

      </p>
      <p>
       When the court in its charge stated the rule to measure mental capacity in this language: “It is your duty in passing on the mental capacity of M.W. Pridgen to determine with reference to the will in controversy whether when he signed same he had such mental capacity as enabled him to understand the provisions contained in the paper, the extent of the same, and to know that he was giving the property therein bequeathed or devised to the person named therein and that he desired her to have it as written in the paper, to know his relatives and to know and realize that it was his free will and desire that his relatives should not have any property of his other than in the manner devised, or that devised,” it was in substance if not verbatim the rule as stated in numerous decisions by the Supreme Court. In re Pridgen's Will,

       Insane delusion must be distinguished from prejudice, hate, bad judgment, ill will,
       
       and any number of other conditions which might be associated with sanity. To be sufficient to invalidate the will, the delusion must have no foundation in fact and must be the product of the testator’s diseased or deranged mind. However, to justify the setting aside of a will on the ground that the testatrix was possessed of an insane delusion, it must also be shown that the insane delusion was actually operative in the production of the will.

      <p>
       Generally, partial insanity will invalidate a will which is the direct offspring thereof, and a will which is the product of an insane delusion is also invalid for want of testamentary capacity. In re Will of Maynard, 64 N.C. App. 211, 307 S.E.2d 416,

       If a person has sufficient mental ability to make a will but is subject to an insane delusion, i.e., monomania, as to one of the essential requirements of testamentary capacity, the will would not be valid. For example, if the testator has an insane delusion as to the objects of his bounty, it would invalidate his will. In re Will of Maynard, 64 N.C. App. 211, 307 S.E.2d 416,

        Necessity of Animus Testandi. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The distinguishing feature of all genuine testamentary instruments, whatever their form, is that the paper-writing must appear to be written animus testandi. It is essential that it should appear from the character of the instrument, and the circumstances under which it is made, that the testator intended it should operate as his will, or as a codicil to it. In re Perry,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       For a memorandum written and signed by the testator to take effect as his will, it must, among other requisites, show that it was made animus testandi, and where the other formalities have been observed, a “pack” of letters containing a note in his favor, with the indorsement written thereon, and signed by him, a long time prior to his death, “I want S.W. have this pack,” will not operate either as a valid holograph will or codicil.

       Where propounders introduce ample evidence that the paper-writing was in the handwriting of deceased and there is no evidence to the contrary, and the paper-writing is dispositive on its face and unequivocally shows the intention of deceased that it should operate as his will, the animus testandi is conclusively presumed, and it is error for the court to submit the question of such intention to the jury over the objection of propounders.

        Some authorities hold that everything required to be done by the testator in the execution of a will shall precede in point of time the subscription by the attesting witness, and that if the signature of the latter precede the signing by the testator the will is void. Until the testator has signed, there is no will and nothing to attest. There are eminent authorities, however, which hold that where the signing of the testator and of the witnesses took place at the same time and constituted one transaction, it is immaterial who signed first.

        The authorities make a distinction between statutes requiring instruments to be signed and those requiring them to be subscribed, holding with practical unanimity in reference to the first class, that it is not necessary for the name to appear on any particular part of the instrument, if written with the intent to become bound; and, as to the second class, that the name must be at the end of the instrument.

        The testator’s signature to the will is required though it is not required that the paper-writing be subscribed or dated. Therefore an undated will, when the name of the testator, in his own handwriting, appears in the body thereof, has the same legal effect as those bearing dates and subscribed by the testator.

        It is for the jury to determine whether the testatrix impliedly requested the attesting witnesses to attest the will, an implied request being sufficient to submit the question to the jury. In re Kelly's Will,

        Evidence tending to show that one of the subscribing witnesses signed the will as such in the presence of testatrix and the other subscribing witness warrants the jury in finding that the witness’ subscription met the requirements of this section, notwithstanding that the witness wavered somewhat in her testimony.

        Where a witness subscribes his name to an instrument during the afternoon, and the purported testatrix signs the instrument the following night, but not in the presence of the witness, the signing of the instrument by the parties cannot be construed as one and the same transaction, and the instrument is not validly witnessed and attested by him, and, upon proof that the instrument was properly subscribed by one other witness, a peremptory instruction in favor of caveators is without error for want of proof that the instrument was subscribed by two witnesses.

        , 24 S.E. 15 (1896), a brother in Texas wrote to his sister in North Carolina that if he got sick or died in Texas he wanted her to have his farm. He simply mailed her the letter. Subsequently he died in Texas and his sister undertook to probate the letter as a holographic will in this State. The question arose whether it had been deposited “with someone for safekeeping”; the court held that this constituted depositing with someone for safekeeping and that the will should be probated. In view of the fact that a testamentary disposition must be accompanied with animus testandi, the decision seems to be clearly unsound, inasmuch as the letter in question discloses no such intention. This conclusion is supported by later decisions of the court which in express terms refuses to follow the doctrine of Alston v. Davis. See

        Although the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving parties, clearly indicated that the will, including the handwritten provisions, was found among the testator’s valuable papers and effects, that the handwritten notation evinced a clear intent regarding the desired disposition for the items contained in Article IV, and that those words explicitly showed that the will should be modified to eliminate Article IV, summary judgment was inappropriate because the phrase in the holographic codicil “begin[n]ing 7-7-03” was sufficiently ambiguous to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether that provision indicated the required present testamentary intent.

        Valuable papers consist of such as are regarded by a decedent as worthy of preservation, and therefore in his estimation, of some value. Much depends upon the condition and business and habits of the decedent in respect to keeping his valuable papers. Winstead v. Bowman,

        Where the handwriting of a testator in a holographic will can be proved and there are no defects in other respects, it is sufficient signature for the testator in a holographic will to sign or write his name in his own handwriting in the body of the will.

        It seems clear that a holographic will may be revoked just as an attested will may, i.e., (1) by burning, tearing, canceling or obliterating or (2) by another will, which may be holographic or attested, provided only that the statutory requirements in each case are complied with. No witnesses are necessary on the holographic revocation. See
        (1908) and

        A will may be revoked by a subsequent instrument executed solely for that purpose, or by a subsequent will containing a revoking clause or provisions inconsistent with those of the previous will, or by any of the other methods prescribed by law; but the mere fact that a second will was made, although it purports to be the last, does not create a presumption that it revokes or is inconsistent with one of a prior date. Where testator devised a certain part of his lands to L, and by a later will gave his effects to his brothers and sisters, the two wills were not inconsistent and the latter did not revoke the former.

        It being shown that a will was once in existence and last heard of in possession of the testator, but could not be found after his death, a presumption arises that it was destroyed by his consent with intent to cancel it. Such presumption is not conclusive, but it imposes upon the person asserting the will the burden of proving that it was not so destroyed, or that the testator was not of sound mind at the time of such presumed destruction.

     <p>
      Dissolution of marriage by absolute divorce or annulment after making a will does not revoke the will of any testator but, unless otherwise specifically provided in the will, it revokes all provisions in the will in favor of the testator’s former spouse or purported former spouse, including, but not by way of limitation, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse or purported former spouse and any appointment of the former spouse or purported former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the testator’s remarriage to the former spouse or purported former spouse.

       N.C. Gen. Stat. § 31-5.4 plainly provides that divorce revokes only those provisions in a will which are in favor of a former spouse; in this case, the trial court erred by excising all provisions in the the ex-husband’s will that referenced the ex-wife and not solely the provisions that favored her.

       Provision in will stating, “In the event my wife be not living at the time of my death,” was a condition precedent that could not be interpreted to favor the ex-wife because the residuary was operative only if the ex-wife had died, and necessarily, she would not be alive to benefit from the estate passing to her relatives.

      <p>
       Ex-husband only intended the residuary devise giving his property to his mother in law and parents to operate if the ex-wife did, in fact, predecease him, and because she did not, the condition went unfulfilled and the residuary devise failed; removing the condition precedent of the ex-wife predeceasing the ex-husband violated the statutes and undermined his intent, and as no other residuary clause existed, the ex-husband’s estate passed by intestacy to his siblings.

       A codicil operates as a republication of the original will and makes it speak as of the date of the execution of the codicil insofar as it is not altered or revoked by the codicil, and therefore a child born after the execution of the will, but before the execution of the codicil, is not entitled to such share in the estate as though testator had died intestate, it being apparent that testator intentionally did not make specific provision for such child.

Unless the omission was intentional, or provision was made for the child, either under the will or some settlement or provision ultra, the after-born child took his share, and the statute applied where there were one or more children.

       As long as a testator makes some provision in the will for an after-born child, whether adequate or not, the child has no right to take an intestate share of the testator’s estate, and a class gift constituted a provision for an afterborn child, even though the gift was contingent.

       Testator had two children, one born before and one after the execution of his will. No testamentary provision was made for either child, but testator, after the birth of the second child, procured a policy of life and accident insurance on his life, making both the children beneficiaries therein. It was held that the procurement of the policy was not such a provision for the after-born child as to prevent such child from participating in his father’s property as heir and distributee.

       Where the caveators could not produce the revocatory writing, and where one witness did not remember witnessing the will, the trial court erred in granting the caveators summary judgment on the ground that the will revoked an earlier will that had excluded the caveators as beneficiaries.

        The purpose of a caveat
        
        is to determine whether the paper-writing purporting to be a will is in fact the last will and testament of the person for whom it is propounded. In re Will of Spinks, 7 N.C. App. 417, 173 S.E.2d 1,
        <cite class="nc_code">

       <p>
        Filing of a caveat is the customary and statutory procedure
        
        for an attack upon the testamentary value of a paper-writing which has been admitted by the clerk of superior court to probate in common form. In re Will of Spinks, 7 N.C. App. 417, 173 S.E.2d 1,

        Questions as to the construction of a will may be brought in a declaratory judgment action; however, there are limitations to the use of a declaratory judgment action. Thus, a caveat proceeding and not declaratory judgment was appropriate to determine the validity of document. Rogel v. Johnson, 114 N.C. App. 239, 441 S.E.2d 558,

        Although it is often stated that, when a caveat is filed superior court acquires jurisdiction of whole matter in controversy, such a pronouncement does not alter affirmative statutory requirement that caveat proceedings can only be instituted by due filing of cause before clerk of superior court.
        When purported caveat is fatally defective from its inception, superior court acquires no jurisdiction over cause. Casstevens v. Wagoner, 99 N.C. App. 337, 392 S.E.2d 776,

       <p>
        The contest of a will by caveat is not an ordinary civil action, but a special proceeding in rem leading to the establishment of the will as a testamentary act under the issue devisavit vel non. The in rem nature of the proceeding dominates the investigation, and in many important respects the parties litigant have little of the usual control over the course of trial on the issue. In re Will of Brock,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         229 N.C. 482

       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the filing of the caveat, the proceeding is transferred to the civil issue docket for trial before a jury. Upon this transfer, notice is given to all interested persons of the challenge, giving them an opportunity to enter and participate in the proceedings to the end that the court may determine whether the decedent left a will and, if so, whether any of the scripts before the court is the will. The proceeding is in rem, in which the court pronounces its judgment as to whether the res, i.e., the script itself, is the will of the deceased. In re Will of Charles,
        <cite class="nc_code">

        A caveat is an in rem proceeding, perhaps more strictly so regarded than any other proceeding with which the courts deal. In re Will of Hester, 84 N.C. App. 585, 353 S.E.2d 643,

        Where there is no allegation that the probate of the will was otherwise than in strict accord with the statute, and there is no suggestion that the court was imposed upon or misled, the validity of the will may be attacked only by direct proceeding in the nature of a caveat under this section.

        When a paper-writing purporting to be a will is presented to the judge of probate, he takes proof with respect to its execution. If found in order the script is admitted to probate in common form as a will. Thus far the proceeding is ex parte. It stands as the testator’s will, and his only will, until challenged and reversed in a proper proceeding before a competent tribunal. The challenge must be by caveat and be heard in the superior court. In re Will of Charles,

        Even if the court were to find a valid fraud claim or sufficient state action to support a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 claim, the statute of limitations barred plaintiffs’ claims, as plaintiffs were objecting to transfers made under a will probated over 125 years ago.

        The general rule is that when a statute creating the right to contest a will and imposing a limitation of time therefor is construed as affixing an inseparable condition to the exercise of the right, that period so limited will not be tolled by fraud other than extrinsic fraud which would vitiate the probate proceeding.

        The question of fraud in obtaining the execution of a will, undue influence, forgery, and the like may be submitted to the probate court in a direct attack on the will by caveat. Fraud of this nature is intrinsic fraud. Extrinsic fraud, on the other hand, relates to the manner in which the judgment is procured. It must relate to matters not in issue and prevent a real contest in the trial. In re Evans, 46 N.C. App. 72, 264 S.E.2d 387,

        While ordinarily whether a cause is barred by the apposite statute of limitations is a mixed question of law and fact, where the facts are admitted or established, the question of the bar of the applicable statute pleaded becomes a question of law, and when such facts disclose that the action is barred the court may sustain the plea and dismiss the action.

       This section is manifestly intended, in cases to which it is applicable, to dispense with the necessity of appointing an administrator pendente lite, and confers very similar forms upon the executor, and more especially when he has entered upon the duties of his office before the caveat is entered.

       The executor is not divested of all his representative powers; nor is the first probate vacated absolutely when the issue touching the will is made up to be tried; nor is there a necessity meanwhile for the appointment of an administrator pendente lite. The function of the executor is suspended only until the controversy is ended, and he is still required to take care of the estate in his hands and may proceed in the collection of debts due the deceased.

       Trial court erred by not freezing and by ordering distributions from a trust to some putative beneficiaries, but not others, during pending litigation because the rightful beneficiaries of the trust were in dispute, the original beneficiaries’ substantial rights were affected by the large sums being distributed from the trust, the wrongful distribution claim, along with all the pending claims, hinged upon undue influence and the decedent’s capacity to execute the purported amendments, the trial court’s order allowing the motion to pay and the pending claims overlapped substantially, and the trustee breached its duty of neutrality by deciding who the rightful beneficiaries were before pending litigation had resolved that issue.

        The testator’s intent gathered from the entire will controls its interpretation. This rule applies to the construction of this section when it appears that the testator devised certain lands without the words of inheritance, and that his intent, gathered from a separate item of the will, was to create a defeasible estate in the first taker, contingent upon his dying at any time, whether before or after the death of the testator, leaving issue surviving him.

        The basic rule of construction, and the refrain of every opinion which seeks to comprehend a testamentary plan, is that the intent of the testator is the polar star that must guide the courts in the interpretation of a will. Wilson v. Spain,

        The rule, that an unrestricted or general devise of real property, to which is affixed, either specifically or by implication, an unlimited power of disposition in the first taker, conveys the fee and a subsequent clause in the will purporting to dispose of what remains at his death is not allowed to defeat the devise nor limit it to a life estate, as well as all rules of construction, must yield to the paramount intent of the testator as gathered from the four corners of the will.

        The rule is elementary that the intention of the testator is the polar star which is to guide in the interpretation of all wills, and, when ascertained, effect will be given to it unless it violates some rule of law, or is contrary to public policy. In ascertaining this intention the language used, and the sense in which it is used by the testator is the primary source of information, as it is the expressed intention of the testator which is sought.

        There was a devise of lands to wife of testator for life, and at her death or remarriage to their two children, by name, for their natural lives for the heirs of their bodies. It was held that, after the death of the widow, the devise was not a trust created in the children as trustees for the “heirs of their bodies,” and there being no expression in the will to show an intent to create an estate of less degree than fee, it constituted an estate tail, converted by our statute into a fee simple.

       A will generally reflects the testator’s testamentary intent as of the date of his death.

        The legislature did not intend that the issue of a devisee or legatee meeting the conditions of subsection (a) could be substituted for that devisee or legatee as to a specific devise or bequest and not allowed to be similarly substituted if the same devisee or legatee were named as one of the residuary devisees or legatees.

         Construction. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) of this section is designed and intended to prevent the lapse of a devise or bequest, whether it be specific or residuary, in a situation where the devisee or legatee, who would have taken had he survived the testator, predeceases testator survived by issue who survive the testator and who would have been heirs of testator had there been no will. If this situation does not exist, then the devise or legacy lapses and passes under the provisions of subdivision (c)(1) under the residuary or by intestacy, if there be no residuary. If lapse of a residuary devise or legacy cannot be prevented by application of subsection (a), then under subdivision (c)(2) it continues a part of the residue and passes to the other residuary legatees or devisees, if any. If none, it passes as if testator had died intestate with respect thereto. That this construction manifests the intent of the legislature is further evidenced by the clear language of the statute itself. Subdivision (c)(2) is applicable, with respect to residuary devises or legacies, only where subsection (a) is not applicable. It would follow, that if the legislature had intended to exclude residuary devises and legacies from the operation of subsection (a), it would have specifically limited the section to specific legacies and devises, omitted subdivision (2) from the provisions of subsection (c), and treated residuary devises and legacies in a separate provision of the statute unrelated to any other section.

        In a residuary gift large enough in its language to comprehend residue, the question is, not what is included, but what is excluded; and one must find words sufficiently large, definite and distinct to enable him to say that some item is excluded, so that what hitherto has purported to be the residuary gift is reduced to the level of a specific gift, and ceases to be a residuary gift.

         Construction to Prevent Intestacy. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A residuary clause in a will should be construed so as to prevent an intestacy as to any part of the testator’s estate, unless there is an apparent intent to the contrary, plainly and unequivocally expressed in the writing. Faison v. Middleton,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         171 N.C. 170

        </cite>
        (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a general rule always to construe a residuary clause so as to prevent an intestacy as regards any part of the testator’s estate, unless there is an apparent intention to the contrary. Betts v. Parrish,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         312 N.C. 47

       <p>
        When the language of the will is definite and clear, the presumption that the will must be construed to prevent partial intestacy is generally not employed. If the language is unambiguous, then there is no need to resort to a construction of the will, and the expression of the testator must be given effect. Betts v. Parrish,

        A lapsed devise of lands will not fall within the residuary clause of a will, under this section, where a contrary intent appears from the construction of a will itself; and where the testator has specifically devised his lands, making ample provisions for his widow, and gives her, in the residuary clause, “all other property not herein specified,” and the use of the word “property,” with the expression “not herein specified,” shows the testator’s intent that a lapsed devise of the realty should not fall within the residuary clause, but will go to the testator’s next of kin instead of those of the widow or her devisees under her will.

        If the will expresses an intent that a legacy shall not lapse

        If the court were to hold that subdivision (c)(2) of this section applies merely because the slayer does not, in fact, predecease the slain, the court would be ignoring the legislative scheme intended by the statutory presumption of the slayer’s death.

       Construction. —  A will or codicil subject to this section is considered to refer to the federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they applied with respect to estates of decedents dying on December 31, 2009, if the will or codicil contains a formula that meets one or more of the following conditions:
