The joint policy shall establish a task force for each economic development region. Each task force shall consist of at least one representative from each of the following: the regional economic development commission, the president, the board of trustees of each community college located in that region, the Chancellor, and the board of trustees of each university campus located in that region, and any additional persons as may be designated by the policy. The task force may appoint an executive committee and any subcommittees it deems appropriate.

       “The policy shall direct each task force to develop a five-year vision plan for its economic development region. At a minimum, each vision plan shall determine the realistic economic development goals and the future job market in that region and shall identify community college and university courses currently offered or needed to effectuate the vision plan. The policy shall require the task forces to review and update their respective vision plans every five years.

      Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3, provides, in part: “The Revisor of Statutes shall recodify Chapter 138A of the General Statutes, Chapter 120C of the General Statutes, as well as Chapter 163 of the General Statutes, as amended by this act, into a new Chapter 163A of the General Statutes to be entitled ‘Elections and Ethics Enforcement Act,’ as enacted by Section 4 of this act. The Revisor may also recodify into the new Chapter 163A of the General Statutes other existing statutory laws relating to elections and ethics enforcement that are located elsewhere in the General Statutes as the Revisor deems appropriate.” The Revisor was further authorized to make technical and conforming changes to catchlines, internal citations, and other references throughout the General Statutes to effectuate this recodification. Pursuant to this authority, the Revisor substituted “G.S. 163A-1592” for “G.S. 163-287” in the last sentence.

       Session Laws 2013-360, s. 15.28(b), provides: “Upon the dissolution of North Carolina’s Eastern Region, the North Carolina’s Eastern Region Development Commission, the governing body of North Carolina’s Eastern Region, shall liquidate the assets of the Region to the extent possible and distribute all Region assets to the counties of the Region in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax levied by the Commission and collected in each county. The assets of the Region that exceed the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected by the counties and are attributable to an appropriation made to the Region by the General Assembly shall revert to the General Fund and may not be distributed to the counties. A county may use funds distributed to it pursuant to this subsection only for economic development projects and infrastructure construction projects. In calculating the amount to be refunded to each county, the Region shall first allocate amounts loaned and not yet repaid as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Amounts loaned for a project in a county will be allocated to that county to the extent of its beneficial ownership of the principal of the interest-bearing trust account in which the proceeds of the vehicle registration tax levied by the Commission were placed, and the county will become the owner of the right to repayment of the amount loaned to the extent of its beneficial ownership of the principal of the trust account.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Amounts not allocated pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated among the remaining counties in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected in each county, and the remaining counties shall become the owners of the right to repayment of the amounts loaned in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected in each county.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Notes and other instruments representing the right to repayment shall, upon dissolution of the Region, be held and collected by the State Treasurer, who shall disburse the collections to the counties as provided in this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Commission shall distribute those assets that it is unable to liquidate among the Region counties insofar as practical on an equitable basis, as determined by the Commission. Upon dissolution, the State of North Carolina shall succeed to any remaining rights, obligations, and liabilities of the Region not assigned to the Region counties.”
