     Section Not Obligatory. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    As the laws of our legislature do not bind another, except insofar as they may be absolute contracts, this section must be taken as merely a rule of construction having no application where the intention of the legislature clearly and explicitly appears to the contrary. Dyer v. Ellington,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     126 N.C. 941

     N.C. LEXIS 340
    </cite>
    (1900).
   </p>
   <p>
    The general rule is that a statute will be given prospective effect
    
    only, unless the law in question clearly forbids such a construction. Corporation of Elizabeth City v. Commissioners of Pasquotank,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     146 N.C. 539

    In case of a remedial legislation, the general rule is not so insistent,
    
    and such statutes are not infrequently given retrospective effect where the language permits and such a construction will best promote the meaning and purpose of the legislature. Waddill v. Masten,

    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    To give operation to the maxim, leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant, the latter law must be in conflict with the former; therefore, when a later statute is almost in ipsissimis verbis with a former one, there is no repeal of the former. Kesler v. Smith,

    A vested right of action is property
    
    in the same sense in which tangible things are property, and is equally protected against interferences. Where it springs from contract, or from the principles of the common law, it is not competent for the legislature to take it away. Williams v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,

     Limitation of Actions. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    While the legislature has the power to extend or reduce the time in which an action may be brought, this is subject to the restriction that when the limitation is shortened, a reasonable time must be given for the commencement of an action before the statute works a bar. Strickland v. Draughan,

    Where, pending an appeal, the subject matter of the action is destroyed or a statute giving the cause of action is repealed, the appellate court will not go into consideration of the abstract question as to which party ought to have prevailed in order to adjudicate the costs, but the judgment below as to costs will be allowed to stand.

     Rules for construction of statutes.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    In the construction of all statutes the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly, or repugnant to the context of the same statute, that is to say:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol11">
     Singular and Plural Number, Masculine Gender, etc. — Every word importing the singular number only shall extend and be applied to several persons or things, as well as to one person or thing; and every word importing the plural number only shall extend and be applied to one person or thing, as well as to several persons or things; and every word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females as well as to males, unless the context clearly shows to the contrary.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol12">
     Authority, to Three or More Exercised by Majority. — All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or more public officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol13">
     “Month” and “Year”. — The word “month” shall be construed to mean a calendar month, unless otherwise expressed; and the word “year,” a calendar year, unless otherwise expressed; and the word “year” alone shall be equivalent to the expression “year of our Lord.” When a statute refers to a period of one or more months and the last month does not have a date corresponding to the initial date, the period shall expire on the last day of the last month.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol14">
     Leap Year, How Counted. — In every leap year the increasing day and the day before, in all legal proceedings, shall be counted as one day.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol15">
     “Oath” and “Sworn”. — The word “oath” shall be construed to include “affirmation,” in all cases where by law an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in like cases the word “sworn” shall be construed to include the word “affirmed.”
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol16">
     “Person” and “Property”. — The word “person” shall extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate, as well as to individuals, unless the context clearly shows to the contrary. The words “real property” shall be coextensive with lands, tenements and hereditaments. The words “personal property” shall include moneys, goods, chattels, choses in action and evidences of debt, including all things capable of ownership, not descendable to heirs at law. The word “property” shall include all property, both real and personal.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol17">
     “Preceding” and “Following”. — The words “preceding” and “following,” when used by way of reference to any section of a statute, shall be construed to mean the section next preceding or next following that in which such reference is made; unless when some other section is expressly designated in such reference.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol18">
     “Seal”. — In all cases in which the seal of any court or public office shall be required by law to be affixed to any paper issuing from such court or office, the word “seal” shall be construed to include an impression of such official seal, made upon the paper alone, as well as an impression made by means of a wafer or of wax affixed thereto.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol19">
     “Will”. — The term “will” shall be construed to include codicils as well as wills.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol110">
     “Written” and “in Writing”. — The words “written” and “in writing” may be construed to include printing, engraving, lithographing, and any other mode of representing words and letters: Provided, that in all cases where a written signature is required by law, the same shall be in a proper handwriting, or in a proper mark.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol111">
     “State” and “United States”. — The word “state,” when applied to the different parts of the United States, shall be construed to extend to and include the District of Columbia and the several territories, so called; and the words “United States” shall be construed to include the said district and territories and all dependencies.
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol112">
     “Imprisonment for One Month,” How Construed. — The words “imprisonment for one month,” wherever used in any of the statutes, shall be construed to mean “imprisonment for thirty days.”
    </li>
    <li id="t12s12-3ol113">
     “Governor,” “Senator,” “Solicitor,” “Elector,” “Executor,” “Administrator,” “Collector,” “Juror,” and “Auditor”. — The words “Governor,” “Senator,” “district attorney,” “elector,” “executor,” “administrator,” “collector,” “juror,” “auditor,” and any other words of like character shall when applied to the holder of such office, or occupant of such position, be words of common gender, and they shall be a sufficient designation of the person holding such office or position, whether the holder be a man or woman.

    It is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation, or, where the words have a definite and precise meaning, to go elsewhere in search of conjecture in order to restrict or extend the meaning. Statutes should be read and understood according to the natural and most obvious import of the language without resorting to subtle and forced construction for the purpose of either limiting or extending their operation.

    Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous there is no room for judicial construction and the courts must give it its plain and definite meaning; the courts are without power to interpolate, or superimpose, provisions and limitations not contained therein.

     140 N.C. 322

    , 52 S.E. 950 (1905), and the court there said: “A misdescription or misnomer in a statute will not vitiate the enactment or render it inoperative, provided the means of identifying the person or thing intended, apart from the erroneous description, are clear, certain, and convincing.” Under this rule we may call to our aid anything in the act itself, or even in the alleged erroneous description, which sufficiently points to something else as furnishing certain evidence of what was meant, though the reference to the extraneous matter may not in itself be full and accurate. The rule, even when literally or strictly construed, does not require that the erroneous description shall be altogether rejected in making the search for the true meaning; but it may be used in connection with anything outside of the statute to which it refers and which itself, when examined, makes the meaning clear. The erroneous description may in this way be helped out by extraneous evidence. Toomey v. Goldsboro Lumber Co.,

    “Upon a perusal of the authorities it appears that the courts have universally given their sanction to the following rules of construction: (1) That the law does not favor a repeal of an older statute by a later one by mere implication. State ex rel. County Trustee v. Woodside,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     30 N.C. 104
    </cite>
    (1847); Simonton v. Lanier,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     71 N.C. 498
    </cite>
    (1874). (2) The implication, in order to be operative, must be necessary, and if it arises out of repugnancy between the two acts the later abrogates the older only to the extent that it is inconsistent and irreconcilable with it. A later and older statute will, if it is possible and reasonable to do so, be always construed together, so as to give effect not only to the distinct parts or provisions of the latter, not inconsistent with the new law, but to give effect to the older law as a whole, subject only to restrictions or modifications of its meaning, where such seems to have been the legislative purpose. A law will not be deemed repealed because some of its provisions are repeated in a subsequent statute, except insofar as the latter plainly appears to have been intended by the legislature as a substitute. State v. Custer,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     65 N.C. 339
    </cite>
    (1871). (3) Where a later or revising statute clearly covers the whole subject matter of antecedent acts, and it plainly appears to have been the purpose of the legislature to give expression in it to the whole law on the subject, the latter is held to be repealed by a necessary implication.” Winslow v. Morton,

    If the invalid portions can be separated from the rest, and if, after their excision, there remains a complete, intelligible, and valid statute capable of being executed, and conforming to the general purpose and intent of the legislature as shown in the act, the same will not be adjudged unconstitutional in toto, but sustained to that extent.

    Under the terms of the deed of trust, debtor obviously had enforceable rights regarding the escrow funds and escrow account, i.e., debtor had the right to insist that the funds be utilized to pay the escrow items specified in the deed of trust, to receive any excess in the escrow account that accumulated during the term of the loan and to receive a refund of any balance in the escrow account upon the payoff of the loan; but, as to whether such rights fall within the definition of real property, despite no North Carolina cases that were dispositive of the question, the court believed that, even under an expanded definition of real property, the North Carolina courts would answer the question in the negative.

     Authority. —  Only the General Assembly has the power to authorize an agency to establish or increase a fee or charge for the rendering of any service or fulfilling of any duty to the public. In the construction of a statute, unless that construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly or repugnant to the context of the statute, the legislative grant of authority to an agency to adopt rules shall not be construed as a grant of authority to the agency to establish by rule a fee or a charge for the rendering of any service or fulfilling of any duty to the public, unless the statute expressly provides for the grant of authority to establish a fee or charge for that specific service. Notwithstanding any other law, a rule adopted by an agency to establish or increase a fee or charge shall not go into effect until the agency has consulted with the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations on the amount and purpose of the fee or charge to be established or increased. Where a rule provides for a periodic automatic adjustment to a fee, the agency that adopts the rule is not required to consult with the Commission every time the fee automatically adjusts. The agency shall submit a request for consultation to all members of the Commission, the Commission Assistant, and the Fiscal Research Division of the General Assembly on the same date the notice of text of the rule is published. The request for consultation shall consist of a written report stating (i) the amount of the current fee or charge, if applicable, (ii) the amount of the proposed new or increased fee or charge, (iii) the statutory authority for the fee or charge, and (iv) a detailed explanation of the need for the establishment or increase of the fee or charge.

     Amending Act Presumed Not to Repeal. —

    Where a statute only undertakes to amend one already on the statute books, it will be presumed that it did not intend to repeal it, unless there is an express repealing clause. State v. Massey,

    Where a statute is amended, all portions of the original act which are not in conflict with the provisions of the amendment remain in the force with the same meaning and effect that they had before the amendment. Rice v. Rigsby,

   </p>
   <p>
    If a statute creating an offense is amended in any important particular, a bill of indictment for an offense committed before the act was amended, but which was found after the passage of the amending act, should charge the offense under the old act, and contain an averment that the offense was committed before the amendment was passed.

     Misdemeanor Made Punishable by Fine or Imprisonment. —

   </p>
   <p>
    A public-local law making an act a misdemeanor was not repealed by a statute making the same offense for the first time punishable by “a fine or imprisonment in the discretion of the court,” and a felony for the second offense, the latter statute expressly stating in the heading of the chapter that it was amendatory, and for the better enforcement of the former statute, and that it was to take effect from and after its ratification; and where the prohibited offense had been committed prior to the enactment of the latter act, it was punishable under the prior law.
