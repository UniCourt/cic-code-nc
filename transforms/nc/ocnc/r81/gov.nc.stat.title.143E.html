    Session Laws
    2017-57, s. 24.1, provides: “The Program Evaluation Division (hereinafter “Division”) is directed to conduct measurability assessments, as provided in Chapter 143E of the General Statutes, and efficiency evaluations of programs and administrative activities of the Department of Administration (hereinafter “Department”) to improve Department accountability reporting and to recommend potential cost savings. Prior to conducting measurability assessments and efficiency evaluations, the Division shall consult with the State Auditor, who shall recommend potential programs or potentially high-cost Department activities that, with changes, may produce cost savings. Taking into account the recommendations of the State Auditor and the results of the measurability assessments, the Division may select a contractor through a noncompetitive bid process to assist the Division in identifying potential cost savings. The State Auditor shall review draft findings and recommendations and shall provide a written response to be included in the Division’s report. By March 30, 2018, the Division shall report its findings and recommendations to the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee and Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on General Government and, upon request, to other committees.”

The Office of State Budget and Management shall receive periodic updates that incorporate new research and enhancements identified through work in participating states and practical technical assistance to implement this cutting-edge approach for identifying policy and budget options. The General Assembly also intends to provide necessary assistance for State agencies to align their individual efforts and resources to achieve statewide priority outcomes.

    “(b) The Office of State Budget and Management may consult and work with staff from the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative to implement a cost-benefit analysis model for use in crafting policy and budget decisions.

    “(d) By October 1, 2018, the Office of State Budget and Management, in consultation with Results First partner agencies and the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative, shall develop and publish descriptive, formal definitions for tiered-levels of evidence. Each definition shall outline the criteria needed to qualify for each tier of evidence. The Office of State Budget and Management shall also identify which program or service areas will be expected to include evidence and research to support budget proposals. The definitions may be periodically updated as needed. The definitions, and any subsequent updates, shall be included in the annual report required by subsection (c) of this section.”
