     Control and custody of prisoners; authorizing prisoner to leave place of confinement. [Effective until January 1, 2023]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Secretary of Public Safety shall have control and custody of all prisoners serving sentence in the State prison system, and such prisoners shall be subject to all the rules and regulations legally adopted for the government thereof. Any sentence to imprisonment in any unit of the State prison system, or to jail to be assigned to work under the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety, shall be construed as a commitment, for such terms of imprisonment as the court may direct, to the custody of the Secretary of Public Safety or his authorized representative, who shall designate the places of confinement within the State prison system where the sentences of all such persons shall be served. The authorized agents of the Secretary shall have all the authority of peace officers for the purpose of transferring prisoners from place to place in the State as their duties might require and for apprehending, arresting, and returning to prison escaped prisoners, and may be commissioned by the Governor, either generally or specially, as special officers for returning escaped prisoners or other fugitives from justice from outside the State, when such persons have been extradited or voluntarily surrendered. Employees of departments, institutions, agencies, and political subdivisions of the State hiring prisoners to perform work outside prison confines may be designated as the authorized agents of the Secretary of Public Safety for the purpose of maintaining control and custody of prisoners who may be placed under the supervision and control of such employees, including guarding and transferring such prisoners from place to place in the State as their duties might require, and apprehending and arresting escaped prisoners and returning them to prison. The governing authorities of the State prison system are authorized to determine by rules and regulations the manner of designating these agents and placing prisoners under their supervision and control, which rules and regulations shall be established in the same manner as other rules and regulations for the government of the State prison system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of Public Safety may extend the limits of the place of confinement of a prisoner, as to whom there is reasonable cause to believe he will honor his trust, by authorizing him, under prescribed conditions, to leave the confines of that place unaccompanied by a custodial agent for a prescribed period of time to

       Receive palliative care, only in the case of a terminally ill inmate or a permanently and totally disabled inmate that the Secretary finds no longer poses a significant public safety risk, and only after consultation with any victims of the inmate or the victims’ families. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “terminally ill” describes an inmate who, as determined by a licensed physician, has an incurable condition caused by illness or disease that was unknown at the time of sentencing and was not diagnosed upon entry to prison, that will likely produce death within six months, and that is so debilitating that it is highly unlikely that the inmate poses a significant public safety risk. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “permanently and totally disabled” describes an inmate who, as determined by a licensed physician, suffers from permanent and irreversible physical incapacitation as a result of an existing physical or medical condition that was unknown at the time of sentencing and was not diagnosed upon entry to prison, and that is so incapacitating that it is highly unlikely that the inmate poses a significant public safety risk. The Department’s medical director shall notify the Secretary immediately when an inmate has been classified as terminally ill and shall provide regular reports on inmates classified as permanently and totally disabled. The Secretary shall act expeditiously in determining whether to extend the limits of confinement under this subdivision upon receiving notice that an inmate has been classified as terminally ill or permanently and totally disabled and, in the case of a terminally ill inmate, the Secretary shall make a good faith effort to reach a determination within 30 days of receiving notice of the inmate’s terminal condition.

The waiver may be taken by videoconference. In the jurisdictions participating in the pilot programs, no proceeding in which a person is charged with a capital felony may be conducted using videoconferencing equipment, but nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the use of testimony at a trial taken by videoconferencing equipment when the testimony is otherwise allowed by law to be taken in that manner.

The study shall address the costs of implementing videoconferencing on a statewide basis for these purposes, as well as the cost savings obtained through the use of such equipment, the quality of the transmissions, the frequency of use, and any other relevant information the Commission deems appropriate.

       Testimony of a sergeant with the North Carolina Department of Correction assigned to the prison camp in which defendant was confined that on the day in question defendant was given permission to leave the unit on a Community Volunteer Leave was sufficient to support the jury’s finding, and it was not necessary that the State present evidence to show that the Secretary of Correction, after making a determination that there was reasonable cause to believe that defendant would honor his trust, had personally authorized defendant’s release to participate in the community volunteer program and had personally prescribed the precise period of time during which the defendant was permitted to be absent from the prison unit.

     Control and custody of prisoners; authorizing prisoner to leave place of confinement. [Effective January 1, 2023]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction shall have control and custody of all prisoners serving sentence in the State prison system, and such prisoners shall be subject to all the rules and regulations legally adopted for the government thereof. Any sentence to imprisonment in any unit of the State prison system, or to jail to be assigned to work under the Division of Prisons of the Department of Adult Correction, shall be construed as a commitment, for such terms of imprisonment as the court may direct, to the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction or his authorized representative, who shall designate the places of confinement within the State prison system where the sentences of all such persons shall be served. The authorized agents of the Secretary shall have all the authority of peace officers for the purpose of transferring prisoners from place to place in the State as their duties might require and for apprehending, arresting, and returning to prison escaped prisoners, and may be commissioned by the Governor, either generally or specially, as special officers for returning escaped prisoners or other fugitives from justice from outside the State, when such persons have been extradited or voluntarily surrendered. Employees of departments, institutions, agencies, and political subdivisions of the State hiring prisoners to perform work outside prison confines may be designated as the authorized agents of the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction for the purpose of maintaining control and custody of prisoners who may be placed under the supervision and control of such employees, including guarding and transferring such prisoners from place to place in the State as their duties might require, and apprehending and arresting escaped prisoners and returning them to prison. The governing authorities of the State prison system are authorized to determine by rules and regulations the manner of designating these agents and placing prisoners under their supervision and control, which rules and regulations shall be established in the same manner as other rules and regulations for the government of the State prison system.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction may extend the limits of the place of confinement of a prisoner, as to whom there is reasonable cause to believe he will honor his trust, by authorizing him, under prescribed conditions, to leave the confines of that place unaccompanied by a custodial agent for a prescribed period of time to

       Receive palliative care, only in the case of a terminally ill inmate or a permanently and totally disabled inmate that the Secretary finds no longer poses a significant public safety risk, and only after consultation with any victims of the inmate or the victims’ families. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “terminally ill” describes an inmate who, as determined by a licensed physician, has an incurable condition caused by illness or disease that was unknown at the time of sentencing and was not diagnosed upon entry to prison, that will likely produce death within six months, and that is so debilitating that it is highly unlikely that the inmate poses a significant public safety risk. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “permanently and totally disabled” describes an inmate who, as determined by a licensed physician, suffers from permanent and irreversible physical incapacitation as a result of an existing physical or medical condition that was unknown at the time of sentencing and was not diagnosed upon entry to prison, and that is so incapacitating that it is highly unlikely that the inmate poses a significant public safety risk. The Department’s medical director shall notify the Secretary immediately when an inmate has been classified as terminally ill and shall provide regular reports on inmates classified as permanently and totally disabled. The Secretary shall act expeditiously in determining whether to extend the limits of confinement under this subdivision upon receiving notice that an inmate has been classified as terminally ill or permanently and totally disabled and, in the case of a terminally ill inmate, the Secretary shall make a good faith effort to reach a determination within 30 days of receiving notice of the inmate’s terminal condition.
       
        The willful failure of a prisoner to remain within the extended limits of his confinement, or to return within the time prescribed to the place of confinement designated by the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction, shall be deemed an escape from the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction punishable as provided in

The Administrative Office of the Courts, in consultation with the Department of Correction [Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety], shall conduct a pilot program to test the feasibility of using videoconference or similar technology to conduct court proceedings involving defendants in the custody of the Department of Correction, instead of requiring live appearances in court for those defendants. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall designate two counties to participate in the pilot, and the Department of Correction shall designate one prison facility.

If a defendant voluntarily and knowingly waives his or her right to appear in person, the court may also accept guilty pleas and impose sentences in cases in which the plea is taken by videoconference, conduct hearings on motions, and conduct probation modification or revocation proceedings. The waiver may be taken by videoconference. In the jurisdictions participating in the pilot programs, no proceeding in which a person is charged with a capital felony may be conducted using videoconferencing equipment, but nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the use of testimony at a trial taken by videoconferencing equipment when the testimony is otherwise allowed by law to be taken in that manner.

The study shall address the costs of implementing videoconferencing on a statewide basis for these purposes, as well as the cost savings obtained through the use of such equipment, the quality of the transmissions, the frequency of use, and any other relevant information the Commission deems appropriate. The report shall be submitted no later than May 1, 2010. The Administrative Office of the Courts and the Department of Correction may seek grant funds to offset any costs associated with the study that cannot be provided by appropriations to those agencies.”

       Testimony of a sergeant with the North Carolina Department of Correction assigned to the prison camp in which defendant was confined that on the day in question defendant was given permission to leave the unit on a Community Volunteer Leave was sufficient to support the jury’s finding, and it was not necessary that the State present evidence to show that the Secretary of Correction, after making a determination that there was reasonable cause to believe that defendant would honor his trust, had personally authorized defendant’s release to participate in the community volunteer program and had personally prescribed the precise period of time during which the defendant was permitted to be absent from the prison unit.

       Lower courts erred in ruling that defendant’s credits should be applied to his sentence, including an unconditional release date, because defendant — whose death sentence had been vacated and replaced with a life sentence — was lawfully incarcerated, the nature and severity of his offenses remained the same and the Department of Correction had discretion in governing him and had never applied credits towards the calculation of an unconditional release date for similar inmates.

       Honor-grade status, work-release privilege, and parole are discretionary acts of grace or clemency extended by the State as a reward for good behavior, conferring no vested rights upon the convicted person. An accused person must be given full constitutional protection before and during his trial, but procedures of constitutional dimension are not appropriate in subsequent determinations of rewards for good behavior while serving a validly imposed sentence of confinement.

      <p>
       The grant of honor-grade status, work release, and parole is by way of mitigating the terms of the judgment which the court has entered. The legality and propriety of the trial and sentence have already been determined after the prisoner has been heard and his constitutional rights have been accorded him. The merits of the trial and the validity of the judgment may not again be raised before the Department of Correction and the Board of Paroles (now Parole Commission). Goble v. Bounds,

      <p>
       Trial court erred in finding that two inmates were eligible to reduce their Class C life sentences by gain and meritorious time credits for the purpose of determining their parole eligibility dates, as (1) sentence reduction credit regulations promulgated under former G.S. 148-13(c) and (d) did not apply to Class C life sentences, and (2) the Secretary of Correction had not passed regulations under former G.S. 148-13(b) to apply good, gain, and meritorious time credits to life sentences. Teasley v. Beck, 155 N.C. App. 282, 574 S.E.2d 137,

       Lower courts erred in ruling that defendant’s credits should be applied to his sentence, including an unconditional release date, because defendant — whose death sentence had been vacated and replaced with a life sentence — was lawfully incarcerated, the nature and severity of his offenses remained the same and the Department of Correction had discretion in governing him and had never applied credits towards the calculation of an unconditional release date for similar inmates.

       Honor-grade status, work-release privilege, and parole are discretionary acts of grace or clemency extended by the State as a reward for good behavior, conferring no vested rights upon the convicted person. An accused person must be given full constitutional protection before and during his trial, but procedures of constitutional dimension are not appropriate in subsequent determinations of rewards for good behavior while serving a validly imposed sentence of confinement.

      <p>
       The grant of honor-grade status, work release, and parole is by way of mitigating the terms of the judgment which the court has entered. The legality and propriety of the trial and sentence have already been determined after the prisoner has been heard and his constitutional rights have been accorded him. The merits of the trial and the validity of the judgment may not again be raised before the Department of Correction and the Board of Paroles (now Parole Commission). Goble v. Bounds,

      <p>
       Trial court erred in finding that two inmates were eligible to reduce their Class C life sentences by gain and meritorious time credits for the purpose of determining their parole eligibility dates, as (1) sentence reduction credit regulations promulgated under former G.S. 148-13(c) and (d) did not apply to Class C life sentences, and (2) the Secretary of Correction had not passed regulations under former G.S. 148-13(b) to apply good, gain, and meritorious time credits to life sentences.

       Lower courts erred in ruling that defendant’s credits should be applied to his sentence, including an unconditional release date, because defendant — whose death sentence had been vacated and replaced with a life sentence — was lawfully incarcerated, the nature and severity of his offenses remained the same and the Department of Correction had discretion in governing him and had never applied credits towards the calculation of an unconditional release date for similar inmates.

     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The Department of Public Safety, Health Services Section, shall establish a telemedicine pilot program to provide physical health services to inmates in remote correctional facilities. The pilot program shall be established with consideration of the results of the study referenced in subsection (a) of this section. The goal of the pilot program is to assess whether the use of telemedicine decreases costs for inmate transportation, custody, and outside providers while improving access to care. While designing the telemedicine pilot program, the Department of Public Safety, Health Services Section, shall consult UNC Health Care; the 2012 University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School report on telemedicine; and Finding 6, Report Number 2018-08, from the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee. The telemedicine pilot program shall initially be established in two correctional facilities serving male inmates. One pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the eastern portion of the State and one pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the western portion of the State. The pilot program design must connect the two correctional facility pilot sites with the Central Prison Healthcare Complex and its contracted providers’ facilities and shall be operational on or before January 1, 2020.
     </p>

       Because a sheriff had a nondelegable duty to provide medical care to inmates, defendant, who was employed by prison health services as a mental health clinician, was an agent of the sheriff as a matter of law; in a prosecution for sexual activity by a custodian, the trial court did not err in barring in limine the introduction of a contract, which according to defendant showed that he was an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the sheriff’s office, because as a matter of law defendant was acting as an agent of the sheriff when the crimes were allegedly committed.

      <p>
       Although Substance Abuse Advisory Council was not given any rule making authority of its own, the clear intent of the General Assembly was to give Council an active role in the formulation of policy governing the substance abuse program. Thus, Council was directed to give advice to Secretary of Correction as to any rules and regulations and on any other matters pertaining to program; however, 1987 legislation did not impose a duty upon the Commission for Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services to consult directly with Council; the
       Commission’s responsibility as set out in
       subsection (d) of this section was left untouched and is fulfilled by giving Secretary of Correction opportunity to review and comment on proposed standards for delivery of substance abuse services to inmates. Secretary of Correction should then consult with the

The pilot program shall be established with consideration of the results of the study referenced in subsection (a) of this section. The goal of the pilot program is to assess whether the use of telemedicine decreases costs for inmate transportation, custody, and outside providers while improving access to care. While designing the telemedicine pilot program, the Department of Public Safety, Health Services Section, shall consult UNC Health Care; the 2012 University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School report on telemedicine; and Finding 6, Report Number 2018-08, from the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee. The telemedicine pilot program shall initially be established in two correctional facilities serving male inmates. One pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the eastern portion of the State and one pilot site shall be located in a correctional facility in the western portion of the State. The pilot program design must connect the two correctional facility pilot sites with the Central Prison Healthcare Complex and its contracted providers’ facilities and shall be operational on or before January 1, 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) The ability to assess, measure, and evaluate the telemedicine pilot program shall be integral to the pilot program design. Assessment of the pilot program shall include, but is not limited to, the following measures for each correctional facility pilot site:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(1) Number and cost of telemedicine encounters by service area.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2) Comparison of the number and cost of telemedicine encounters, by service area, to:

     </p>
     <p>
      “b. The number of in-person encounters provided during the pilot period at similar correctional facilities not participating in the pilot.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      “(5) Amount of provider transportation costs avoided from providing telemedicine.

      “(6) Cost of initial telemedicine equipment and other related costs with descriptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(7) Obstacles and concerns related to expanding telemedicine to other correctional facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d) On or before January 1, 2020, the Department of Public Safety, Health Services Section, shall provide an interim report on the assessment criteria outlined in subsection (c) of this section, including any additional findings and recommendations, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice and Public Safety and the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services. On or before January 1, 2021, the Department of Public Safety, Health Services Section, shall report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice and Public Safety and the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services on the assessment criteria outlined in subsection (c) of this section, including any additional findings, and shall make recommendations on whether to expand the telemedicine pilot program to additional sites, including accompanying costs and anticipated savings, and recommendations on which correctional facilities would be most advantageous to include in the pilot due to lack of access or costs associated with transportation and custody.”

       Because a sheriff had a nondelegable duty to provide medical care to inmates, defendant, who was employed by prison health services as a mental health clinician, was an agent of the sheriff as a matter of law; in a prosecution for sexual activity by a custodian, the trial court did not err in barring in limine the introduction of a contract, which according to defendant showed that he was an independent contractor and not an agent or employee of the sheriff’s office, because as a matter of law defendant was acting as an agent of the sheriff when the crimes were allegedly committed.

       In an inmate’s action alleging medical malpractice against physicians employed by the Department of Public Safety (DPS), the trial court did not err in denying the physicians’ motions to dismiss on the ground of public official immunity because the physicians were not public officials entitled to immunity; DPS’s decision to employ its own physicians appears to be a policy decision.

      <p>
       Although Substance Abuse Advisory Council was not given any rule making authority of its own, the clear intent of the General Assembly was to give Council an active role in the formulation of policy governing the substance abuse program. Thus, Council was directed to give advice to Secretary of Correction as to any rules and regulations and on any other matters pertaining to program; however, 1987 legislation did not impose a duty upon the Commission for Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services to consult directly with Council; the
       Commission’s responsibility as set out in
       subsection (d) of this section was left untouched and is fulfilled by giving Secretary of Correction opportunity to review and comment on proposed standards for delivery of substance abuse services to inmates. Secretary of Correction should then consult with the
       Council under

     Procedure when surgical operations on inmates are necessary.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The medical staff of any penal institution of the State of North Carolina is hereby authorized to perform or cause to be performed by competent and skillful surgeons surgical operations upon any inmate when such operation is necessary for the improvement of the physical condition of the inmate. The decision to perform an operation shall be made by the chief medical officer of the institution, with the approval of the superintendent of the institution, and with the advice of the medical staff of
    the institution. No operation shall be performed without the consent of the inmate; or, if the inmate is a minor, without the consent of a responsible member of the inmate’s family, a guardian, or one having legal custody of the minor; or, if the inmate be non compos mentis, then the consent of a responsible member of the inmate’s family or of a guardian shall be obtained. Any surgical operations on inmates of State penal institutions shall also be subject to the provisions of Article 1A of Chapter 90 of the General Statutes,

      If the operation on the inmate is determined by the chief medical officer to be an emergency situation in which immediate action is necessary to preserve the life or health of the inmate, and the inmate, if sui juris, is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated so as to be incapable of giving consent or in the case of a minor or inmate non compos mentis, the consent of a responsible member of the inmate’s family, guardian, or one having legal custody of the inmate cannot be obtained within the time necessitated by the nature of the emergency situation, then the decision to proceed with the operation shall be made by the chief medical officer and the superintendent of the institution with the advice of the medical staff of the institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all cases falling under this section, the chief medical officer of the institution and the medical staff of the institution shall keep a careful and complete record of the measures taken to obtain the permission for the operation and a complete medical record signed by the medical superintendent or director, the surgeon performing the operation and all surgical consultants of the operation performed.

Individuals meeting the condition set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection may be ordered to be transferred for an initial period not to exceed 30 days. The sheriff of the county from which the prisoner is removed shall be responsible for conveying the prisoner to the prison unit where the prisoner is to be held and for returning the prisoner to the jail of the county from which the prisoner was transferred. The officer in charge of the prison unit designated by the Secretary of Public Safety shall receive custody of the prisoner in accordance with the terms of the order. Prior to the conclusion of the 30-day period, the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice shall conduct an assessment of treatment and venue needs. The assessment shall be conducted by the attending medical or mental health professional and shall assess the medical and mental health needs of the prisoner and make a recommendation on whether the prisoner should remain in the custody of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety or if the prisoner should be returned to the custody of the county. To extend the order beyond the initial 30-day period, the sheriff shall provide the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice assessment and any other relevant information to the resident judge or the superior court or any judge holding superior court in the district or any district court judge who shall determine whether to extend the transfer of the prisoner to a unit of the State prison system beyond the initial 30-day period. If the judge determines that the prisoner should remain in the custody of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice, the judge shall renew the order and include a date certain for review by the court. Prior to the date of review, the Division shall conduct a reassessment of treatment and venue needs and the sheriff shall provide the reassessment and any other relevant information to the court, as described in this subsection. If the judge determines that the prisoner should not remain in the custody of the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice, the officer in charge of the prison unit designated by the Secretary of Public Safety shall release custody of the prisoner in accordance with the court order and the instructions of the attending medical or mental health professional. The Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice shall be reimbursed from the Statewide Misdemeanant Confinement Fund for the costs of housing the misdemeanant, including the care, supervision, and transportation of the misdemeanant.

Individuals meeting the condition set forth in subdivision (2) of this subsection may be ordered to be transferred for an initial period not to exceed 30 days. The sheriff of the county from which the prisoner is removed shall be responsible for conveying the prisoner to the prison unit where the prisoner is to be held and for returning the prisoner to the jail of the county from which the prisoner was transferred. The officer in charge of the prison unit designated by the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction shall receive custody of the prisoner in accordance with the terms of the order. Prior to the conclusion of the 30-day period, the Division of Prisons shall conduct an assessment of treatment and venue needs. The assessment shall be conducted by the attending medical or mental health professional and shall assess the medical and mental health needs of the prisoner and make a recommendation on whether the prisoner should remain in the custody of the Division of Prisons of the Department of Adult Correction or if the prisoner should be returned to the custody of the county. To extend the order beyond the initial 30-day period, the sheriff shall provide the Division of Prisons assessment and any other relevant information to the resident judge or the superior court or any judge holding superior court in the district or any district court judge who shall determine whether to extend the transfer of the prisoner to a unit of the State prison system beyond the initial 30-day period. If the judge determines that the prisoner should remain in the custody of the Division of Prisons, the judge shall renew the order and include a date certain for review by the court. Prior to the date of review, the Division shall conduct a reassessment of treatment and venue needs and the sheriff shall provide the reassessment and any other relevant information to the court, as described in this subsection. If the judge determines that the prisoner should not remain in the custody of the Division of Prisons, the officer in charge of the prison unit designated by the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction shall release custody of the prisoner in accordance with the court order and the instructions of the attending medical or mental health professional. The Division of Prisons shall be reimbursed from the Statewide Misdemeanant Confinement Fund for the costs of housing the misdemeanant, including the care, supervision, and transportation of the misdemeanant.

       Whenever a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term to be served in the State prison system or a local confinement facility, the Secretary of Public Safety may authorize the Director of Prisons or the custodian of the local confinement facility to grant work-release privileges to any inmate who is eligible for work release and who has not been granted work-release privileges by order of the sentencing court. The Secretary of Public Safety shall authorize immediate work-release privileges for any person serving a sentence not exceeding five years in the State prison system and for whom the presiding judge shall have recommended work-release privileges when (i) it is verified that appropriate employment for the person is available in an area where, in the judgment of the Secretary, the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety has facilities to which the person may suitably be assigned, and (ii) custodial and correctional considerations would not be adverse to releasing the person without supervision into the free community.

       The Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety shall from time to time, as the need becomes evident, designate and adapt facilities in the State prison system for quartering prisoners with work-release privileges. No State or county prisoner shall be granted work-release privileges by the Director of Prisons or the custodian of a local confinement facility until suitable facilities for quartering him have been provided in the area where the prisoner has employment or the offer of employment.

       The Secretary of Public Safety is authorized and directed to establish a work-release plan under which an eligible prisoner may be released from actual custody during the time necessary to proceed to the place of his employment, perform his work, and return to quarters designated by the prison authorities. If the prisoner shall violate any of the conditions prescribed by prison rules and regulations for the administration of the work-release plan, then such prisoner may be withdrawn from work-release privileges, and the prisoner may be transferred to the general prison population to serve out the remainder of his sentence. Rules and regulations for the administration of the work-release plan shall be established in the same manner as other rules and regulations for the government of the State prison system.

       Whenever a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term to be served in the State prison system or a local confinement facility, the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction may authorize the Director of Prisons or the custodian of the local confinement facility to grant work-release privileges to any inmate who is eligible for work release and who has not been granted work-release privileges by order of the sentencing court. The Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction shall authorize immediate work-release privileges for any person serving a sentence not exceeding five years in the State prison system and for whom the presiding judge shall have recommended work-release privileges when (i) it is verified that appropriate employment for the person is available in an area where, in the judgment of the Secretary, the Division of Prisons of the Department of Adult Correction has facilities to which the person may suitably be assigned, and (ii) custodial and correctional considerations would not be adverse to releasing the person without supervision into the free community.

If the prisoner shall violate any of the conditions prescribed by prison rules and regulations for the administration of the work-release plan, then such prisoner may be withdrawn from work-release privileges, and the prisoner may be transferred to the general prison population to serve out the remainder of his sentence.

       As a rehabilitative measure, the Secretary of Public Safety is authorized to require any prisoner granted work-release privileges to make restitution or reparation to an aggrieved party from any earnings gained by the defendant while on work release when the sentencing court recommends that restitution or reparation be paid by the defendant out of any earnings gained by the defendant if he is granted work-release privileges and out of other resources of the defendant, including all real and personal property owned by the defendant and the income derived from such property.

If the court determines that restitution or reparation should not be recommended, it shall so indicate on the commitment. If, however, the court determines that restitution or reparation should be recommended, the court shall make its recommendation a part of the order committing the defendant to custody. The recommendation shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of G.S. 15A-1343(d) and Article 81C of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes. If the offense is one in which there is evidence of physical, mental or sexual abuse of a minor, the court may order the defendant to pay from work release earnings the cost of rehabilitative treatment for the minor. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare and distribute forms which provide ample space to make restitution or reparation recommendations incident to commitments, which forms shall be conveniently structured to enable the sentencing court to make its recommendation.

       Since the decision to impose restitution or reparation is discretionary with the trial court and the Secretary, and since indigency could be considered in making that decision, subsection (c) of this section and G.S. 148-57.1(c) are not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection discriminating against indigent defendants.

       The requirement that a defendant pay restitution under subsection (c) of this section or G.S. 148-57.1(c) as a condition of obtaining work-release or parole is not inherently unconstitutional. Whether the restitution requirement is unconstitutional as applied to a particular defendant may only be determined by considering the defendant’s financial status and other relevant circumstances at the time when the restitution must be paid, that is, after a defendant becomes eligible for work-release privileges or parole.

       As a rehabilitative measure, the Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction is authorized to require any prisoner granted work-release privileges to make restitution or reparation to an aggrieved party from any earnings gained by the defendant while on work release when the sentencing court recommends that restitution or reparation be paid by the defendant out of any earnings gained by the defendant if he is granted work-release privileges and out of other resources of the defendant, including all real and personal property owned by the defendant and the income derived from such property.

If the court determines that restitution or reparation should not be recommended, it shall so indicate on the commitment. If, however, the court determines that restitution or reparation should be recommended, the court shall make its recommendation a part of the order committing the defendant to custody. The recommendation shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of G.S. 15A-1343(d) and Article 81C of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes. If the offense is one in which there is evidence of physical, mental or sexual abuse of a minor, the court may order the defendant to pay from work release earnings the cost of rehabilitative treatment for the minor. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare and distribute forms which provide ample space to make restitution or reparation recommendations incident to commitments, which forms shall be conveniently structured to enable the sentencing court to make its recommendation.

       Since the decision to impose restitution or reparation is discretionary with the trial court and the Secretary, and since indigency could be considered in making that decision, subsection (c) of this section and G.S. 148-57.1(c) are not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection discriminating against indigent defendants.

       The requirement that a defendant pay restitution under subsection (c) of this section or G.S. 148-57.1(c) as a condition of obtaining work-release or parole is not inherently unconstitutional. Whether the restitution requirement is unconstitutional as applied to a particular defendant may only be determined by considering the defendant’s financial status and other relevant circumstances at the time when the restitution must be paid, that is, after a defendant becomes eligible for work-release privileges or parole.

        Imposition of Fine Is Not Restitution. —

       When an active sentence is imposed, the judge should consider whether, as a further rehabilitative measure, restitution or reparation should be ordered or recommended to the Secretary of Correction to be imposed as a condition of attaining work-release privileges; however, the imposition of a fine is not restitution or reparation within the meaning of this section and should not be included in a judgment under this section.

        Deprivation of procedural rights before or during imprisonment does not constitute grounds or justification for, an escape by a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law. This is so even though the sentence the prisoner was serving at the time was later held to be irregular or voidable. A prisoner in such case may not put himself in defiance of the duly constituted authorities by escaping from custody but must seek redress in compliance with due process. State v. Warren, 4 N.C. App. 441, 166 S.E.2d 858,

        North Carolina has held that a prisoner escaping while serving a sentence is not immune to punishment for the escape even though the sentence he was serving at the time of the escape was irregular or voidable and is set aside and a new trial ordered after the escape but prior to imposition of sentence for the escape, since a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law may not defy that authority but must seek redress in compliance with due process.

        Deprivation of procedural rights before or during imprisonment does not constitute grounds or justification for, an escape by a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law. This is so even though the sentence the prisoner was serving at the time was later held to be irregular or voidable. A prisoner in such case may not put himself in defiance of the duly constituted authorities by escaping from custody but must seek redress in compliance with due process. State v. Warren, 4 N.C. App. 441, 166 S.E.2d 858,

        North Carolina has held that a prisoner escaping while serving a sentence is not immune to punishment for the escape even though the sentence he was serving at the time of the escape was irregular or voidable and is set aside and a new trial ordered after the escape but prior to imposition of sentence for the escape, since a prisoner serving a sentence imposed by authority of law may not defy that authority but must seek redress in compliance with due process.

        Exact time is not an essential element of the offense of escape as set out in subdivision (g)(1)

        Motion to dismiss was properly denied in defendant’s trial for work-release escape under G.S. 148-45(g)(1) because, although the evidence demonstrated that defendant was recaptured within 24 hours, it also indicated that defendant’s family only surrendered him after officers threatened to obtain a search warrant and press criminal charges against the family members for harboring a fugitive; thus, defendant failed to show that the undisputed evidence supported the conclusion that he voluntarily returned into custody.

        Since defendant’s plea of not guilty put in issue every essential element of the crime charged, and defendant was charged with escaping from the lawful custody of the State Department of Correction while then and there serving time for a felony, trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury that before they could convict defendant of the felony of escape charged, they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the escape he was serving a sentence imposed upon conviction of a felony, was prejudicial error which entitled defendant to a new trial.

       As a rehabilitative measure, the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission is authorized to require a prisoner to whom parole or post-release supervision is granted to make restitution or reparation to an aggrieved party as a condition of parole or post-release supervision when the sentencing court recommends that restitution or reparation to an aggrieved party be made a condition of any parole or post-release supervision granted the defendant. When imposing restitution as a condition and setting up a payment schedule for the restitution, the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission shall take into consideration the resources of the defendant, including all real and personal property owned by the defendant and the income derived from such property, his ability to earn, and his obligation to support dependents. The Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission shall not be bound by such recommendation, but if it elects not to implement the recommendation, it shall state in writing the reasons therefor, and shall forward the same to the sentencing court.

       When an active sentence is imposed, the court shall consider whether, as a rehabilitative measure, it should recommend to the Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission that restitution or reparation by the defendant be made a condition of any parole or post-release supervision granted the defendant. If the court determines that restitution or reparation should not be recommended, it shall so indicate on the commitment. If, however, the court determines that restitution or reparation should be recommended, the court shall make its recommendation a part of the order committing the defendant to custody. The recommendation shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 81C of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare and distribute forms which provide ample space to make restitution or reparation recommendations incident to commitments, which forms shall be conveniently structured to enable the sentencing court to make its recommendation.If the offense is one in which there is evidence of physical, mental or sexual abuse of a minor, the court may order, as a condition of parole or post-release supervision, that the defendant pay the cost of any rehabilitative treatment for the minor.

Such rules and regulations shall also provide additional methods whereby facts may be obtained to supplement the recommendation of the sentencing court.

        Constitutionality. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Since the decision to impose restitution or reparation is discretionary with the trial court, the Secretary and the Parole Commission, and since indigency could be considered in making that decision, G.S. 148-33.2(c) and subsection (c) of this section are not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection discriminating against indigent defendants. State v. Lambert, 40 N.C. App. 418, 252 S.E.2d 855,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      <p>
       The requirement that a defendant pay restitution under G.S. 148-33.2(c) or subsection (c) of this section as a condition of obtaining work-release or parole is not inherently unconstitutional. Whether the restitution requirement is unconstitutional as applied to a particular defendant may only be determined by considering the defendant’s financial status and other relevant circumstances at the time when the restitution must be paid, that is, at the time he becomes eligible for parole or work-release privileges.

       There is no statutory requirement for a sentencing judge to inquire into a defendant’s ability to pay restitution when the judge merely recommends restitution as a condition of parole or work release. State v. Arnette, 67 N.C. App. 194, 312 S.E.2d 547,

        Constitutionality of Requiring Repayment of Attorneys’ Fees. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The interlocking statutes and court decisions that regulate North Carolina’s ability to recover the costs of court-appointed counsel meet constitutional requirements. The indigent defendant’s fundamental right to counsel is preserved under the system; he is given ample opportunity to challenge the decision to require repayment at all critical stages; and he is protected against heightened civil or criminal penalties based solely on his inability to pay. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 19436 (4th Cir. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though far from a paragon of clarity and detail as a complete program, the North Carolina statutes relating to the repayment of attorneys’ fees by restitution embody all the required features of a constitutionally acceptable approach. The indigent defendant’s fundamental right to counsel is preserved under the North Carolina statute and no preconditions are placed on the exercise of that right beyond a reasonable and minimally intrusive procedure designed to establish the fact of indigency. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 19436 (4th Cir. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like its civil recoupment statute, North Carolina’s procedures for imposing the reimbursement of court-appointed counsel fees as a condition of parole are narrowly drawn to avoid unfairness and discriminatory effects. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 19436 (4th Cir. 1984).

        Amount of Restitution Must Be Supported by Evidence. —

       The amount of restitution recommended by the trial court must be supported by evidence adduced at trial or at sentencing. State v. Wilson,
       <cite class="nc_code">

       The decision to recommend restitution or reparation is discretionary,

      <p>
       When a court imposes an active sentence, it may recommend restitution as a condition of work-release, as a condition of post-release supervision and parole, or as a condition of probation, but it may not require the defendant to make restitution while serving an active sentence.

      <p>
       While North Carolina statutes authorize the imposition of a condition, upon parole eligibility, of restitution to victims of crime who have suffered economic loss as a result of that crime, law enforcement agencies are not within the class of such victims.

      <p>
       Although the North Carolina Supreme Court has never definitively decided the issue, there is persuasive authority in North Carolina law supporting the State’s right to claim the status of an “aggrieved party” for the expenses associated with providing court-appointed counsel.

     Governor to execute compact; form of compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Governor of North Carolina is authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the State of North Carolina with any state of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Preamble.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: The Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers was established in 1937, it is the earliest corrections “compact” established among the states, and has not been amended since its adoption over 62 years ago;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: This compact is the only vehicle for the controlled movement of adult parolees and probationers across state lines, and it currently has jurisdiction over more than a quarter of a million offenders;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: The complexities of the compact have become more difficult to administer, and many jurisdictions have expanded supervision expectations to include currently unregulated practices such as victim input, victim notification requirements, and sex offender registration;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: After hearings, national surveys, and a detailed study by a task force appointed by the National Institute of Corrections, the overwhelming recommendation has been to amend the document to bring about an effective management capacity that addresses public safety concerns and offender accountability;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: The General Assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety. The Governor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a compact on behalf of the State of North Carolina with any state of the United States and other territorial possessions of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas: Upon the adoption of this Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, it is the intention of the General Assembly to repeal the previous Interstate Compact for the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers one year after the effective date of this compact.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3a">
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
      </li>
      <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3b">
       It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:
       <ol>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3b1">
         To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and to protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community;
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3b12">
         To provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3b13">
         To equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c">
       In addition, this compact will:
       <ol>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c1">
         Create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies, which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c12">
         Ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c13">
         Establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators;
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c14">
         Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and
        </li>
        <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3c15">
         Coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t148a4Bs148-65.5ol3d">
       The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provision of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of the public policies and are therefore public business.

The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state’s reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.

            Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor; the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state; the Majority and Minority Leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature; and the state council.The grounds of default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor; the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state; the Majority and Minority Leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature; and the state council of such termination.The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.

       The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, and with the federal government, thereby serving the best interest of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.

         Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.

In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record, together with any recommendations of the hearing officials, shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.

       This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states.

      <li id="t148a12s148-120ol18">
       This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate official of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notice provided in said statute has been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.
      </li>
      <li id="t148a12s148-120ol19">
       Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.

If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
