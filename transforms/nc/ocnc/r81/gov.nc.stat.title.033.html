    Session Laws 1987, c. 550, s. 11 changed the title of this Chapter to read “Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.” However, in view of the repeal of Article 12 of this Chapter by Session Laws 1987, c. 563, which added a new Chapter 33A, the North Carolina Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes no change has been made in the title of Chapter 33.
