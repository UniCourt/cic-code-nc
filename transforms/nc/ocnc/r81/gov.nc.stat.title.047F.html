        This Act is based, in part, on the provisions of the Uniform Planned Community Act. Many sections, however, have been substantially revised from those that appear in the Uniform Act. Some other sections marked “Reserved” contained provisions which were included in the Uniform Act but were deemed inappropriate for inclusion in this Act. Because of these differences, the Official Comments to the Uniform Act have not been included.

      <p>
       In a community that was not subject to the North Carolina Planned Community Act, the homeowners’ association’s amendment to the declaration of restrictive covenants to provide almost unlimited power to assess lot owners was unreasonable; the amendment exceeded the original intent of the contracting parties, as the original declaration provided no such authority, and the community had public roads, no common areas, and no amenities. Armstrong v. Ledges Homeowners Ass'n,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        360 N.C. 547

      <p>
       Where a community is not governed by the North Carolina Planned Community Act, amendments to a declaration of restrictive covenants must be reasonable; reasonableness may be ascertained from the language of the declaration, deeds, and plats, together with other objective circumstances surrounding the parties’ bargain, including the nature and character of the community.

      <p>
       In a dispute over a homeowners’ association’s duty to collect dues, it was error to grant the homeowners’ association summary judgment on a clubhouse’s breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing claim against the association because (1) the association had a contractual obligation to collect dues for the clubhouse, (2) the association’s statements to homeowners that the association would no longer collect dues conflicted with that obligation, and (3) the association did not show the contract was unconscionable.

Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to lot owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, as provided in the termination agreement.

       Homeowners association’s late claim for assessments that had not been paid by a debtor who had filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy was allowed as a postpetition debt on a ruling holding that the sum represented an actual and necessary cost of preserving the bankruptcy estate and thus was a permitted administrative expense under 11 U.S.C.S. § 503(b) and that the result was consistent with the rule on such claims as adopted by the Fourth Circuit; moreover, though the association did not have a secured claim to recover prepetition arrearages arising from the debtor’s membership in the association because it did not comply with the filing requirements in

All financial and other records, including records of meetings of the association and executive board, shall be made reasonably available for examination by any lot owner and the lot owner’s authorized agents as required in the bylaws and Chapter 55A of the General Statutes.

In addition to any specific information that is required by the bylaws to be assembled and reported to the lot owners at specified times, the association shall make an annual income and expense statement and balance sheet available to all lot owners at no charge and within 75 days after the close of the fiscal year to which the information relates. Notwithstanding the bylaws, a more extensive compilation, review, or audit of the association’s books and records for the current or immediately preceding fiscal year may be required by a vote of the majority of the executive board or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the lot owners present and voting in person or by proxy at any annual meeting or any special meeting duly called for that purpose.

The association, its managers, or its agents may charge a reasonable fee for providing statements of unpaid assessments, not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00) per statement or request, and an additional expedite fee in an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00) if the request for a statement is made within 48 hours of closing.
