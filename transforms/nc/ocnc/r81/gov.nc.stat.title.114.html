        Legislative Intent. —

      <p>
       The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor’s constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of subdivision (2) of this section, did not intend to create such potential. Tice v. DOT, 67 N.C. App. 48, 312 S.E.2d 241,

       Provision authorizing attorneys in the Special Prosecution Division to “perform any other duties
       
       assigned to them by the Attorney General” merely authorizes the Attorney General to delegate those duties which he is elsewhere authorized to perform. It creates no independent authority in its own right. State v. Felts, 79 N.C. App. 205, 339 S.E.2d 99,

       When this section is read in pari materia with N.C. Const., Art. IV, § 18,
       
       it is apparent that our Constitution and statutes give the district attorneys of the State the exclusive discretion and authority to determine whether to request, and thus permit, the prosecution of any individual case by the Special Prosecution Division. State v. Camacho,

        Authority of Trial Court Exceeded. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In passing this section, the General Assembly made it clear that even upon a proper request and authorization by a district attorney, the Special Prosecution Division is to participate in criminal prosecutions only if the Attorney General, in his sole discretion as an independent constitutional officer, approves. Thus trial court exceeded its authority when it ordered that “the Attorney General’s Office shall immediately assume the prosecution of ” a capital case. State v. Camacho,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        329 N.C. 589

       </cite>
       (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court exceeded its authority by ordering that in order to avoid the possibility or impression of any conflict of interest, the district attorney and his entire staff must withdraw from a capital case and have no further participation either directly or indirectly with regard to the case. State v. Camacho,

       Session Laws 2011-19, s. 3, provides: “The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) shall encourage and seek collaborative opportunities and grant funds for research programs, in association, whenever possible, with the university system or independent nationally recognized forensic institutions, on human observer bias and sources of human error in forensic examinations. Such programs might include studies to determine the effects of contextual bias in forensic practice (e.g., studies to determine whether and to what extent the results of forensic analysis are influenced by knowledge regarding the background of the suspect and the investigator’s theory of the case). In addition, research on sources of human error should be closely linked with research conducted to quantify and characterize the amount of error. Based on the results of these studies, and in consultation with the North Carolina Forensic Sciences Advisory Board, the North Carolina State Crime Laboratory should develop standard operating procedures (that will lay the foundation for model protocols) to minimize, to the extent possible, potential bias and sources of human error in forensic science. These standard operating procedures should apply to all forensic analyses that may be used in litigation.”
