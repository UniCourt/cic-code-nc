        Taking Acknowledgment as Judicial Act. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Taking of an acknowledgment of the execution of a deed by a notary public is a judicial or quasi-judicial act by a public official for which he may not be held liable absent a showing that his act was corrupt. Nelson v. Comer, 21 N.C. App. 636, 205 S.E.2d 537,

        Effect of Disqualification. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the disqualification of either the probating or acknowledging officer appears upon the face of the record, the registration is a nullity as to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers. Quinnerly v. Quinnerly,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      <p>
       When the incapacity of the acknowledging or probating officer is latent, i.e., does not appear upon the record, one who takes under the grantee in such instrument gets a good title, unless the party claiming the benefit of the defected acknowledgment or probate is cognizant of the fact.

       A timber deed in regular form, having a valid assignment of the timber rights by the grantee in the deed endorsed on its back, was duly registered, and the endorsement was transcribed on the records with the deed. It was held that even though the endorsement was sufficient as a conveyance of the timber rights, the endorsement was not acknowledged, and therefore there was no registration of the endorsement so as to defeat the rights of the creditors of the grantee in the deed.

       A proof or acknowledgement that does not require a seal or stamp of the notary to be effective in the jurisdiction issuing the notary’s commission shall include either (i) a statement by the notary within the proof or acknowledgement area of the instrument that the notary is not required to utilize a seal or stamp or (ii) a reference that purports to be the statute of the commissioning state which provides that no seal or stamp is required together with a statement that the notary is not required to utilize a seal or stamp. The register of deeds may rely upon this statement and is not responsible for confirming its validity or the authority of the person making it. A register of deeds shall not refuse to accept a record for registration because a notarial seal or stamp is omitted from the proof or acknowledgement if this subsection has been complied with in the proof or acknowledgement. The acceptance of a record for registration under this subsection gives rise to a presumption that the seal or stamp was not required to be affixed by the notary. This presumption is rebuttable and applies to all instruments whenever recorded. However, a court order finding the lack of a valid seal does not affect the rights of a person that (i) records an interest in the real property described in the instrument before the finding of a lack of a valid seal and (ii) would otherwise have an enforceable interest in the real property.

        Name of Notary on Notarial Seal. —

       The statute does not require that the notary’s name or any name should be used on the notarial seal, though customarily the name of the notary does appear thereon. The seal appended by the notary to his certificate is presumably his, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. This is not rebutted by the mere fact that the notary signs his name “Geo. Theo. Sommer” and the seal has on it the name of “Theo. Sommer,” when the fact of the execution of the deed is adjudged to have been proved by such seal and certificate of the notary. Deans v. Pate,

     </h3>
     <p>
      The grantee or other party to an instrument required or allowed by law to be registered may at his own expense obtain from the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the instrument is required to be registered a subpoena for any or all of the makers of or subscribing witnesses to such instrument, commanding such maker or subscribing witness to appear before such clerk at his office at a certain time to give evidence concerning the execution of the instrument. The subpoena shall be directed to the sheriff of the county in which the person upon whom it is to be served resides. If any person refuses to obey such subpoena he is liable to a fine of forty dollars ($40.00) or to be attached for contempt by the clerk, upon its being made to appear to the satisfaction of the clerk that such disobedience was intentional, under the same rules of law as are prescribed in the cases of other defaulting witnesses.

          The register of deeds has authorized the submitter to electronically register the electronic document.

          The document is submitted by a United States federal or state governmental unit or instrumentality or a trusted submitter. For purposes of this subsection, “a trusted submitter” means a person or entity that has entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding electronic recording with the register of deeds in the county in which the electronic document is to be submitted.

           Verification of Officer’s Signature. —
          
          Submission to a register of deeds of an electronic document requiring proof or acknowledgement is a representation by the submitter that, prior to submission, the submitter verified the officer’s signature required under subdivision (a1)(3) of this section to be one of the types of signatures listed in this subsection. The register of deeds may rely on this representation for purposes of determining compliance with the signature requirements of this section. The electronic registration of a document with a register of deeds prior to the effective date of this statute is not invalid based on whether the register verified the officer’s signature in accordance with this subsection. The types of signatures are:
         </p>
         <p>
          (1)

This presumption applies regardless of whether the image is legible or photographically reproduced in the records maintained by the register of deeds and applies to all instruments filed in the records maintained by the register of deeds regardless of when the instrument was presented for registration.

       If the certificate is not found in due form, the instrument is rejected. If the certificate is adjudged in due form, then the clerk (now the register of deeds) admits to probate, i.e., probates it, passes upon the certificate as furnishing proof of execution, and adjudges as to the genuineness of the certificate, the authority of the officer, and whether the justice or officer certifying is such, and the sufficiency of proof as certified.

       This article results from a study the General Statutes Commission was directed to perform by S.L. 2004-161, s. 6.1. The Commission filed its report with the General Assembly on January 26, 2005, and a supplement to that report on March 8, 2005.
       The Uniform Act’s term “recorder” was replaced throughout with the term used in this State, “register of deeds.”

        “Document.”  A document consists of information stored on a medium, whether the medium be tangible or electronic, provided that the information is retrievable in a perceivable form. The traditional tangible medium has been paper on which information is inscribed by writing, typing, printing or similar means. It is perceivable by reading it directly from the paper on which it is inscribed. An electronic medium may be one on which information is stored magnetically and from which it may be retrieved and read indirectly on a computer monitor or a paper printout.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.2-officialcommentol12">
        “Electronic.”  The term “electronic” refers to the use of electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic and similar technologies. It is a descriptive term meant to include all technologies involving electronic processes. The listing of specific technologies is not intended to be a limiting one. For example, biometric identification technologies would be included if they affect communication and storage of information by electronic means. As electronic technologies expand and include other competencies, those competencies should also be included under this definition.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.2-officialcommentol13">
        “Electronic document.”  An “electronic document” is a “document” that is in an “electronic” form. Both of these terms are previously defined. However, this definition adds an additional requirement not specifically stated in the individual definitions. In order to be an “electronic document” the document must be received by the recorder in an “electronic” form. The character of a document as “electronic” or “paper” will be determined at the moment it is received by the recorder.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.2-officialcommentol14">
        “Electronic signature.”  The term “electronic signature” is based on the definition of that term in UETA § 2(8). However, this definition uses the word “document” instead of “record” to identify the instrument being signed. (See generally paragraph 1, above, for a discussion of the reasons).
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.2-officialcommentol15">
        “Person.”  The definition of a “person” is the standard definition for that term used in acts adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It includes individuals, associations of individuals, and corporate and governmental entities.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       While a document recorded in a land records office will usually contain information affecting real property, it need not necessarily be so limited. It applies to any document that is recorded in the land records office maintained by the recorder. Deeds, grants of easements, and mortgages are documents subject to this act. Similarly, certificates and affidavits not directly affecting real property may be documents under this act if state law provides these documents are to be recorded in the land records office.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of a document in this act is derived from the definition of the term “record” as contained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) § 2(13). In the terms of that act, a document is a record that is eligible to be recorded in the land records maintained by the recorder. In selecting the defined term “document” for use throughout this act, an explicit decision was made not to use “record” as a defined term. The term “record” has a different meaning in real estate recording law and practice than it has in UETA. If the term “record” were used generally in this act, it might lead to confusion and misinterpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In UETA, the term “record” refers to information on a tangible or electronic medium as does the term “document” in this act. In this act, however, depending on syntax, the term “record” and its variations can have several meanings, all of which deal with document storage and not the information itself. For example, this act deals with the
    recording
    process through which a person can
       <i>
        record
       </i>
       a document. The government officer who oversees the land
       <i>
        records
       </i>
       office is the
       <i>
        recorder
       </i>
       . These terms are so ingrained in the lexicon of real estate recording law and practice that it would not be productive to attempt to change them by this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of the term “electronic” in this act has the same meaning as it has in UETA § 2(5).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a document may have an existence in an “electronic” form prior or subsequent to being received by the recorder it might not be an “electronic document” under this act. For example, the document may have been created by an electronic process or have existed in an electronic form before being converted to, and received by the recorder in, a paper form. Thus, a document prepared on a computer by means of a word processing program may have been created electronically and may still exist electronically. If, however, the document is printed and submitted to the recorder on paper, the submitted document is not an electronic document. Similarly, after arriving in the recorder’s office in a paper form, the document may be converted to an electronic form prior to, or as part of, the recording process. The paper document does not become an electronic document because of the post-receipt conversion. (For a definition of the term “paper document,”
    see
    § 4(a).)
      </p>
      <p>
       By comparison, a document received by the recorder in an electronic form, but subsequently converted to a paper form, will be considered to be an electronic document. For example, if a document is received electronically and then printed in a paper form in the recorder’s office prior to storage, it is, nonetheless, an electronic document. Thus, a document received by the process commonly known as a facsimile or a FAX, is an electronic document. Issues common to electronic documents, such as security and integrity, also relate to a facsimile or FAX document.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases a document may have originally been executed in a paper form with “wet signatures” and subsequently imaged and converted into an electronic format. This act provides that, if such a converted document is received by the recorder in an electronic format, it will be considered to be an electronic document and may be recorded. (
    See
    § 3(a).)
      </p>
      <p>
       This act does not state or limit the type of electronic documents that may be accepted by the recorder. Nor does it state the type of electronic signatures that are permissible. Those matters are subject to the standards adopted by the state Electronic Recording Commission or state agency pursuant to § 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       This act applies only to documents that are received by the recorder in an electronic form and enables those documents to be recorded. The recordability of documents not received by the recorder in an electronic form continues to depend on other state law.

        Subsection (a) states the basic principle of this act — if a document would be recordable in a paper format, an electronic document with the same content and meeting the requirements of this act is also recordable. Any reference in a statute, regulation, or standard to a document as being on paper or a similar tangible medium in order to be recorded is superseded by this act. Similarly any statute, regulation, or standard that specifies that a document must be in writing in order to be recorded is also overruled by this act. Furthermore, since any paper-specific requirement such as the size of the paper or the color of the ink used for the document is inapplicable to an electronic document, those requirements do not prohibit or limit the recording of electronic documents.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.3-officialcommentol1b">
        Subsection (b) provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a document be signed in order to be recorded is satisfied by an electronic signature attached to an electronic document. The provisions of UETA and the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign) provide that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the enforceability of an electronic document between the parties to the transaction. Similarly, this section provides that an electronic signature is not an impediment to the recording of the document.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.3-officialcommentol1c">
        This section provides that any statute, regulation, or standard requiring that a notarization, acknowledgement, verification, witnessing, or taking of an oath be done on paper or similar tangible medium, that it be done in writing, or that it be signed, is satisfied by an electronic signature that is attached to, or logically associated with, the electronic document. It permits a notary public or other authorized person to act electronically without the need to do so on paper.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This subsection also provides that any stipulation of state law requiring that a document be an original document is satisfied by an electronic document meeting the requirements of this act. For example, this section acknowledges that one form of electronic document is created by making an electronic duplicate of an original paper document. The duplicate is an electronic “picture” of the original document with all of its signatures and verifications. Under some existing state laws, the electronic duplicate may be considered to be a copy of the original paper document and not the original itself. The laws of the state may also provide that a copy of a document may not be recorded. This act corrects that circumstance and allows the electronic document containing the “picture” of the original document to be recorded. Of course, in order to be valid, the original paper document must be executed in accordance with law, including a signature and verification.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also provides that any statute, regulation, or standard that requires a personal or corporate stamp, impression, or seal is satisfied by an electronic signature. These physical indicia are inapplicable to a fully electronic document. Thus, the notarial stamp or impression that is required under the laws of some states is not required for an electronic notarization under this act. Nor is there a need for a corporate stamp or impression as would otherwise be required under the laws of some states to verify the action of a corporate officer. Nevertheless, this act requires that the information that would otherwise be contained in the stamp, impression, or seal must be attached to, or logically associated with, the document or signature in an electronic fashion.

        A “paper document” is one that is received by the recorder in a form that is not “electronic.” Despite the use of the word “paper,” this document form is not limited to documents on a paper medium; the use of the word “paper” is merely a convenience. It applies to any non-electronic document that the recorder is authorized to accept.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b">
        Subsection (b) sets forth specific required or elective functions that apply to the recording of documents.
        <ol>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b1">
          With the exception of paragraphs (1) and (4), implementation of any functions described in subsection (b) is optional and a decision to implement one or more of them is to be made by the recorder. The act does not require that a recorder implement any or all of those functions. It merely allows each recorder to implement them when and if the recorder decides to proceed with electronic recording.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b12">
          Paragraph (2) provides that the recorder may choose to implement electronic recording functions. Recording functions are varied and deal with obtaining and storing of documents in a recording system. Under this paragraph, the recorder may elect to receive electronic documents. The recorder may store those electronic documents, or the information contained in them, and create an index of the documents or information. The recorder may also transmit electronic documents and communications to the recording party or to other parties. Finally, the recorder may archive the electronic documents or the information in them as well as the index in order to preserve and protect them. This is an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to provide electronic searching, as described in paragraph (3).
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b13">
          Paragraph (3) provides that the recorder may choose to implement electronic search and retrieval functions. Searching and retrieval functions include any process by which a title searcher obtains information from the land records system. The paragraph allows a recorder to authorize persons to access documents or their information, including index information, electronically. In so doing, the recorder may allow the accessing party to search the index and the stored documents or information electronically and to retrieve them in an electronic format. This is an election to be made by the recorder that is separate from the decision to record electronic documents, as described in paragraph (2). A recorder who operates a “Torrens” title registration system also may choose to implement the functions of accessing, searching, and retrieving documents or information in the title registration system.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b14">
          This act does not require that persons engaging in real estate transactions use electronic documents in order to have their documents recorded. It merely permits the recorder to accept electronic documents if they are presented electronically. Economics, availability of technology, and human nature suggest that not everyone will begin to use electronic real estate documents immediately. It will likely be some time before the use of electronic documents becomes dominant and perhaps well beyond that before paper documents disappear altogether from the conveyancing process. In recognition of that fact, paragraph (4) requires the recorder to continue to accept paper documents even after establishing an electronic recording system. This is a mandatory and not an elective provision.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b15">
          Paragraphs (5) and (6) relate to the conversion and storage of the text or information contained in paper documents in an electronic form. It does not concern the index information that is derived from those paper documents. The treatment of index information is described in the paragraph (4).
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b16">
          Paragraph (6) relates to the conversion of information from “old” paper documents recorded prior to the implementation of an electronic recording system. As with newly-received paper documents, the act does not require the recorder to convert previously-recorded information into an electronic form. Such a conversion is, however, permitted under the act.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b17">
          Paragraph (7) provides that any fee or tax that is collected by the recorder may be collected through an electronic payment system. Without a means of paying the applicable fees and taxes electronically, the achievement of a speedy and efficient electronic recording system would not be possible. Although the document could be submitted electronically, the fee would have to be paid by traditional means. The effective completion of the recording would be delayed until that payment is received by the recorder.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.4-officialcommentol2b18">
          Commonly, before a recorder may accept a document for recording it must be approved by one or more other offices in order to assure compliance with the other office’s requirements. The person submitting the document may also be required to pay fees or taxes to the other office or offices. If the prior approval and the fee or tax paying processes are not conjoined with the electronic recording process, it will not be possible to effectuate the speedy electronic recording envisioned by this act.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Just as with the definition of an “electronic document” in section 2 of this act, the moment at which the character of the document will be determined is the moment it is received by the recorder. If a document is received by the recorder in a non-electronic form, it is a “paper” document regardless of whether it has a prior or subsequent existence as an electronic document.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, under paragraph (1) if a recorder does elect to implement any of the functions described in this section, the recorder must do so in accordance with the standards established by the Electronic Recording Commission or the state agency. All aspects of the functions described in this subsection are subject to the standards of the Commission or agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this act also applies to “Torrens” title registration systems, a recorder who operates a title registration system may choose to implement the functions of receiving, indexing, storing, archiving, and transmitting electronic documents for the title registration system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This paragraph also provides that the recorder must index the paper documents together with electronic documents as part of a single indexing system. This will enable a title examiner to make a single search of one index for the purpose of ascertaining all relevant instruments that were recorded after the initiation of electronic recording. It avoids the inefficient and costly process of maintaining and searching two separate indexing systems - one for electronic documents and one for paper documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Efficiency also suggests that the unified index would be an electronic one. It would be more efficient to store the index information from paper documents in an electronic index than to convert and store the index information from electronic documents in a paper index system. Electronic index information can be sorted and managed more easily and efficiently than paper index information. In addition, an electronic index can be searched more quickly and without the searcher’s physical presence in the recorder’s office. However, the act does not require the index chosen by the recorder to be an electronic one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (5) relates to the conversion of “new” paper documents received by the recorder after the implementation of an electronic recording system. It does not require that such newly-received paper documents be converted and stored in an electronic form. It does, however, permit the recorder to make a conversion of those paper documents into an electronic form and store them with electronic documents received by the recorder. If the paper documents are not converted into an electronic form, the recorder must continue to store them and, as public documents, the recorder must continue to provide a process for accessing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the recorder does not convert “new” paper documents into an electronic form, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system may be limited. A title examiner will have to obtain physical access to the paper document information in traditional ways. Since electronic documents are stored electronically, the examiner will have to access two different storage systems - one for paper documents and one for electronic documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dealing with “old” document information is more challenging than dealing with “new” documents simply because of the potentially large expenditure of time and money needed to convert a significant volume of paper information extending over many past years into an electronic form. The time period over which a fully-effective conversion would extend probably spans a period of forty to sixty or more years, depending on the customary period of search in the jurisdiction. Without the conversion, the usefulness and efficiency of the electronic recording system is limited, at least until the passage of a period after the adoption of the act that is equal to the customary period of search.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nature and operation of the electronic payment system is not specified. The selection is subject to standards set by the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency and the choice of the recorder. Among others, the alternatives might include a subscription service with a regular billing system, a prepayment system with recording and access charges applied against a deposited amount, or a payment per individual service system.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a document may first need to be submitted to the county assessor or treasurer to determine whether prior real estate taxes have been paid or whether current ones are due. Under current practice that submission and approval might have to be accomplished in a physical process independent of the electronic recording process. If a tax or fee is due, that sum might also have to be paid by check or other non-electronic process to the treasurer. Procedures such as these will delay the electronic recording process and will limit the achievement of a speedy, efficient electronic recording system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (8) permits and encourages the recorder to enter into agreements with other county and state offices for the purpose of implementing processes that will allow the simultaneous satisfaction of all conditions precedent to recording and the payment of all fees and taxes in a single transaction. Any fees and taxes paid by the recording party will be allocated among the recorder and the other offices in accordance with their agreements.

        This section provides two alternatives for designating the entity that will adopt standards to implement this act.
       </li>
       <li id="t47a1As47-16.5-officialcommentol5b">
        The Electronic Recording Commission or state agency is directed to adopt standards to implement the provisions of this act. As provided in section 4, recorders implementing any of the functions of this act must comply with those standards.
        <ol>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.5-officialcommentol5b1">
          the standards and practices of other states adopting this uniform act or a substantially similar one. In many situations, Electronic Recording Commissions or state agencies of other states may have already considered the same issue. Their research and subsequent experiences may prove very helpful to the commission or state agency in making its decision.
         </li>
         <li id="t47a1As47-16.5-officialcommentol5b12">
          the most recent standards promulgated by national standard-setting bodies, such as the Property Records Industry Association (PRIA). National standard-setting organizations such as PRIA will likely have considered the issue that is now before the commission or agency and have developed a protocol or standard to deal with it. Furthermore, since these bodies are national in scope, they will likely already have considered the needs of recording districts of varying size, population and resources when promulgating their standards.

         <li id="t47a1As47-16.5-officialcommentol5b13">
          the views of interested parties. Among others, these persons should include county recorders and potential users of the electronic recording system such as real estate attorneys, mortgage lenders, representatives from the title and escrow industries, real estate brokers, and notaries public. It must also consider the views of governmental offices that may interact with the recording offices, such as clerks of court, taxing authorities, and the office of the Secretary of State.

          the needs of counties of varying size, population and resources. Because most states are quite diverse in the size, population and resources of their recording venues, it is important that the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency consider all of their needs. Standards that are designed only for large, populous and well-funded recording districts may not promote the development of electronic recording in smaller, less-populous and not-as-well funded recording districts. This subsection recognizes that the standards should promote the overall good of the entire state and not just the good of certain types of recording venues. Thus, the commission is advised to consider the needs of the entire spectrum of recording districts.

      </ol>
      <p>
       Alternative A creates a state Electronic Recording Commission and provides for its general composition. The exact size of the board is to be determined by the legislature. The appointment of the commissioners is to be made by the governor or another state official or governmental body determined by the legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Alternative A, the majority of the members of the commission must be recorders. Recorders, by the fact that the standards adopted by the Electronic Recording Commission will affect the operation of their offices, have a professional interest in generating efficient, functional standards. If the recorders are appointed from sufficiently diverse recording venues, they can also provide valuable input as to the needs of recording districts of varying size, population and resources, as described further in subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative B delegates the duty to adopt standards to implement this act to an existing state agency. In some states this oversight of the recording process, and in some cases the electronic recording process, has already been delegated to an existing state agency. In like fashion, some state legislatures may wish to delegate these duties to an existing state agency instead of creating a new commission as is directed in Alternative A.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the state agency has oversight of many diverse functions, it might prove useful for the agency to establish a subdivision to implement and adopt standards for this act. The agency or subdivision might also wish to establish a regular process to obtain advice from persons with expertise in the area of recordings, particularly in electronic recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the objectives of this act is to facilitate the efficient use of electronic recording within the state and among the various adopting states. This subsection directs the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency to seek to keep the standards and practices of the recording offices in states using electronic recording in harmony and uniformity with each other. Ease of user access and interoperability and the promotion of interstate commerce depend highly on a similarity of standards and operating processes among the various recording offices. However, differences in operating processes and their governing standards may be justified based on legitimate differences that exist from venue to venue. The commission is not required to adopt the same standards and practices that exist in other states, but must give them serious consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       When adopting, amending or repealing standards the commission or agency must consider the following factors:
      </p>
      <p>
       The authenticity of documents stored in any recording system is of utmost importance. If forged or invalid documents are accepted for recording, landowners and those depending on their titles can be seriously affected. Thus, the commission or state agency is directed to consider standards that would protect an electronic recording system from accepting and recording documents that are not authentic and genuine. Furthermore, even if an electronic document is authentic in its origin, it may be possible to intercept it in transmission and change its content. Such a change could cause problems equally problematic as those caused by an originally forged document. Thus, the commission or state agency is directed to consider standards that would protect documents from tampering and inaccuracies caused during transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subsection also directs the commission or state agency to consider standards for the proper preservation of electronic documents once they are in the electronic recording system. If an unauthorized person were to be able to “hack” or enter the electronic recording system, that person could cause considerable damage and injury to the records and persons having an interest in the affected land. Thus, the commission or state agency is directed to consider standards protecting the electronic land records system from unauthorized intrusion and tampering. Finally, the subsection directs the commission or state agency to consider adequate standards for the preservation of electronic documents. If there should only be one copy of the electronic land records and it is destroyed by an electronic or physical catastrophe, the security of the land records system would be seriously impaired. Thus, the commission or state agency should consider the means and methodology of preserving and replicating the electronic land records so that the recorder can recover from such a catastrophe with no loss of information.

       This section blends the Uniform Act’s alternatives for a standard-setting body and adds other provisions in order to produce a regulatory structure similar to the current regulatory structure in this State for setting standards for paper documents filed with a register of deeds. Subsections (a) through (f) replace subsection (a) of the Uniform Act. Subsection (g) is substantially the same as subsection (b) of the Uniform Act with conforming changes to reflect the different regulatory structure.

       This section recites the importance of uniformity among the adopting states when applying and construing the act. It is more general than the uniformity stated in section 5 for the Electronic Recording Commission or state agency when implementing or adopting standards. This section seeks uniformity in all situations when the application or interpretation of the act itself is considered or under review.

        Principles applicable to sufficiency of references necessary to impart vitality to a prior unregistered encumbrance
        
        may be stated as follows: (1) The creditor holding the prior unregistered encumbrance must be named and identified with certainty; (2) The property must be conveyed “subject to” or in subordination to such prior encumbrance; (3) The amount of such prior encumbrance must be definitely stated; and (4) The reference to the prior unregistered encumbrance must amount to a ratification and adoption thereof.

        North Carolina recognizes a difference between rents which have already accrued and rents which will be accruing in the future. Already accrued rents are personalty (choses in action) while rents accruing in the future are incorporeal hereditaments — interests in real property. Thus the recordation of the deed of trust was necessary to perfect the security interest in rents accruing in the future. Westchase I Assocs. v. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins.

        When a grantee accepts a conveyance subject to an outstanding claim or interest evidenced by an unrecorded instrument
        
        executed by his grantor, he takes the property burdened by that claim or interest; by accepting such a deed he ratifies the unrecorded instrument and agrees to take the property subject to it and is estopped to deny the unrecorded instrument’s validity. This principle derives from the theory that reference to the unrecorded encumbrance, if made with sufficient certainty, creates a trust or agreement that the property is held subject to the encumbrance.

        The recording act protects only creditors of the grantor, bargainor, or lessor and purchaser for value against an unregistered conveyance of land. The same reasoning which prevents a party from introducing into evidence against a lien creditor or purchaser for value a deed invalidly registered does not apply to exclude an invalidly registered deed introduced against a party claiming an interest in the land by descent. An heir is not a purchaser for value entitled to the protection of the recording act. Hi-Fort, Inc. v. Burnette, 42 N.C. App. 428, 257 S.E.2d 85,

        No distinction is made in the statute or in the opinions of the court construing and applying the statute between creditors and purchasers for value. No conveyance of land is valid to pass any property from the donor or grantor, against either creditors or purchasers for value, but from the registration thereof. As to a purchaser for value who has recorded his deed, it has been held that a prior deed from the same grantor, unregistered, does not exist, as a conveyance or as color of title. The same is true as against the creditors. Eaton v. Dorib,

        While the cancellation of a preexisting debt may be sufficient consideration to constitute the grantee in a registered deed from the debtor a purchaser for value within the protection of the Connor Act (this section), so as to take free from the claim of the grantee in a prior unregistered deed from the debtor, where the debtor transfers the property without consideration to a third person, who in turn transfers the property to the creditor without any consideration moving from the creditor to such third person, the creditor cannot maintain that the cancellation of the debt constitutes him a purchaser for value so as to be protected under the Connor Act, since his deed from the third person is not supported by any consideration, and it is required that the creditor be a “purchaser for value from the donor, bargainor, or lessor” in order to be protected.

        A 1997 deed, which was secured by the related deed of trust, was the only deed of record on the petition date. Therefore, it followed that while the unrecorded 2003 deed may have been valid as between the debtors and the creditor, it was ineffective against the rest of the world. In re Carpenter, 2010 Bankr.

        Lessee’s claims against a purchaser were properly dismissed under the Connor Act, G.S. 47-18(a), because: (1) the initial lease was for more than three years and was never recorded; (2) the purchaser recorded its option to purchase the property before the lease with its right of first refusal was recorded; (3) the allegedly fraudulent actions of false representations that the lease had expired, failure to comply with the registration requirement in the first amended lease, and shell transfers of the property, were done by the sellers, not the purchasers, and did not constitute fraud under the Connor Act.

        Trial court did not err in ruling that the right of first refusal (ROFR) agreement in a lessee’s benefit was enforceable and that purchasers were not entitled to specific performance of an option agreement to buy the property from the lessor because they were not innocent purchasers for value; the fact that the ROFR agreement was not recorded did not protect the subsequent option agreement because under the statute, a right of first refusal did not have to be recorded in order to be valid.

        It is well settled in the state that a restrictive covenant is not enforceable, either at law or in equity, against a subsequent purchaser of property burdened by the covenant unless notice of the covenant is contained in an instrument in his chain of title.

         Registration Is Not Notice as to After-Acquired Interest. —

       <p>
        A written contract executed by a tenant in common without the knowledge or authorization of his cotenants to sell the timber on the entire tract was recorded. The tenant in common later acquired an additional interest in the land. It was held that registration was constructive notice to all subsequent purchasers as to the tenant’s original interest, but the vendee’s right to demand conveyance of the timber as to the after-acquired interest rested upon the personal contract of the vendor, which was not required to be recorded by this section, and therefore registration was not notice to subsequent purchasers as to such after-acquired title.

        Deed Ineffective. —

       Grantor signatures on the deed were those of individuals, not that of a limited liability company; the fact that the parties entered a stipulation as to the validity of the deed did not change that the deed on the public record said what it said and was ineffective to convey title.

     <p>
      Any person holding any unregistered deed or claiming title thereunder, executed prior to the first day of January, 1920, may have the same registered without proof of the execution thereof by making an affidavit, before the officer having jurisdiction to take probate of such deed, that the grantor, bargainor or maker of such deed, and the witnesses thereto, are dead or cannot be found, that he cannot make proof of their handwriting, and that affiant believes such deed to be a bona fide deed and executed by the grantor therein named. Said affidavit shall be written upon or attached to such deed, and the same, together with such deed, shall be entitled to registration in the same manner and with the same effect as if proved in the manner prescribed by law for other deeds.

        The object of this section is to prevent fraud,
        
        and to that end it requires the registration of encumbrances so that purchasers and creditors may have notice of their existence and nature, and all persons may see for what the encumbrances were created. When the registration is made, creditors of the mortgagor are able to avail themselves of their legal remedy against the equity of redemption in the land. This publicity affords the creditors all the benefit they can reasonably ask or that the law intended. Starke v. Etheridge,

        The purpose of North Carolina’s recording statute is to enable intending purchasers and encumbrancers to rely with safety on the public record concerning the status of land titles. However, the recording statute only protects innocent purchasers for value. Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Burton, 599 F. Supp. 1313, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21191 (M.D.N.C. 1984).

It is designed to protect third parties. In re Westchase I Assocs., 119 B.R. 521, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 1694 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1990).

        Bank was not entitled to relief from a bankruptcy court order cancelling its deed of trust where, inter alia, its two year delay in seeking relief was not reasonable, and it would create significant unfair prejudice to an innocent bona fide purchaser who gave fair value for clear title. That order unambiguously cancelled the bank’s deed of trust, and a certified copy of the order was recorded in the register of deeds in compliance with North Carolina’s race recording statute, the purpose of which was to enable purchasers to rely with safety upon an examination of records.

        In a case in which a trial court granted summary judgment in favor of a bank, which declared that a deed of trust filed by the bank had priority over and was superior to any interest created by the deed of trust filed by a mortgage company, even though the mortgage company recorded its deed of trust before the bank filed its deed of trust, the mortgage company’s deed of trust failed to name a trustee and failed to contain a proper description of the real property to be conveyed to the trustee. The mortgage company could not reform the deed of trust because the general rule was that reformation would not be granted if the
        rights of an innocent bona fide purchaser would thereby be prejudiced. Fifth Third Mortg. Co. v. Miller, 202 N.C. App. 757, 690 S.E.2d 7,

        Because a bona fide purchaser of the parcel would not have been charged with notice of the bank’s lien based on an examination of the parcel identifier number index when the bankruptcy petition was filed (the deed of trust, while recorded as to a different contiguous parcel, was not so recorded as to the parcel at issue), even if the purchaser had knowledge of the lien, the trustee likewise was not imputed with such knowledge; therefore, the trustee was properly allowed to avoid the lien under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3).

        North Carolina recognizes a difference between rents which have already accrued and rents which will be accruing in the future. Already accrued rents are personalty (choses in action) while rents accruing in the future are incorporeal hereditaments — interests in real property. Thus the recordation of the deed of trust was necessary to perfect the security interest in rents accruing in the future. Westchase I Assocs. v. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All persons, firms, or corporations now owning or hereafter acquiring any deed or agreement for rights-of-way and easements of any character whatsoever shall record such deeds and agreements in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the land affected is situated. Where such deeds and agreements may have been acquired, but no use has been made thereof, the person, firm, or corporation holding such instrument, or any assignment thereof, shall not be required to record them until within 90 days after the beginning of the use of the easements granted thereby. If after 90 days from the beginning of the easement granted by such deeds and agreements the person, firm, or corporation holding such deeds or agreements has not recorded the same in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the land affected is situated, then the grantor in the said deed or agreement may, after 10 days’ notice in writing served and returned by the sheriff or other officer of the county upon the said person, firm, or corporation holding such lease or agreement, file a copy of the said lease or agreement for registration in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the original should have been recorded, but such copy of the lease or agreement shall have attached thereto the written notice above referred to, showing the service and return of the sheriff or other officer. The registration of such copy shall have the same force and effect as the original would have had if recorded: Provided, said copy shall be duly probated before being registered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall require the registration of the following classes of instruments or conveyances, to wit:

       It shall not apply to any deed or instrument so defectively executed or witnessed that it cannot by law be admitted to probate or registration, provided that such deed or instrument was executed prior to the ratification of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t47a02s47-27ol13">

       <p>
        No deed, agreement for right-of-way, or easement of any character shall be valid as against any creditor or purchaser for a valuable consideration but from the registration thereof within the county where the land affected thereby lies.

       <p>
        From and after July 1, 1959, the provisions of this section shall apply to require the Department of Transportation to record as herein provided any deeds of easement, or any other agreements granting or conveying an interest in land which are executed on or after July 1, 1959, in the same manner and to the same extent that individuals, firms or corporations are required to record such easements.

The plat should include, at a minimum, the referenced horizontal datum and realization (i.e., “NAD 83 (2011)”) as well as the data or method used to establish those coordinates, or both. If the bearings shown on the map are not referenced to the same datum as the grid coordinates shown, then either (i) the coordinates of a second point shall be labeled and the two labeled points tied together by a single azimuth or course and distance or (ii) the plat shall include, in written and graphical form, the conversion from plat bearings to reference bearings. Control monuments within a previously recorded subdivision may be used in lieu of grid control. In the interest of consistency with previously recorded plats, existing bearing control may be used where practical. Where no horizontal control monument of any United States or State agency survey system, such as the North Carolina Geodetic Survey, is located within 2,000 feet of the subject property, ties to other appropriate natural monuments or landmarks may be used in lieu of grid coordinates. In all cases, the tie lines shall be sufficient to reproduce the subject lands from the control or reference points used.

       , notice of a nonmaterial typographical or other minor error in a deed or other instrument recorded with the register of deeds may be given by recording a corrective notice affidavit. For purposes of this section, an error that would affect the respective rights of any party to the instrument is not a nonmaterial typographical or minor error. If a corrective notice affidavit is conspicuously identified as a corrective notice or scrivener’s affidavit in its title, the register of deeds shall index the name of the affiant, the names of the original parties in the instrument, the recording information of the instrument for which the corrective notice is being given, and the original parties as they are named in the affidavit. A copy of the previously recorded instrument to which the corrective notice affidavit applies may be attached to the corrective notice affidavit and need not be a certified copy. To the extent the correction is inconsistent with the originally recorded instrument, and only to that extent, notice of the corrective information as provided by the affiant in the corrective notice affidavit is deemed to have been given as of the time the corrective notice affidavit is registered. Nothing in this section invalidates or otherwise alters the legal effect of any instrument of correction authorized by statute in effect on the date the instrument was registered.

A copy of a proposed Curative Affidavit accompanies this notice. The proposed Curative Affidavit identifies the previously recorded instrument or instruments that contain the description errors that I plan to correct, the description error or errors that require correction, and the correct description of the real property. If I sign and record the proposed Curative Affidavit, it will have the legal effect of correcting the erroneous property description in the listed instrument or instruments that contain the description errors. Real property you own may be affected if I correct the erroneous description of the real property in the instrument or instruments identified in the proposed Curative Affidavit. You should consult with your attorney and your title insurance company, if known, promptly to determine whether and the extent to which my correction of the legal description in the instrument or instruments that need to be corrected will impact your property or property rights. IF YOU WISH TO OBJECT TO MY SIGNING AND RECORDING THE PROPOSED CURATIVE AFFIDAVIT OR DISPUTE THE FACTS RECITED IN THE PROPOSED CURATIVE AFFIDAVIT, YOU MUST DO SO IN A WRITING SENT OR DELIVERED TO ME WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU WERE SERVED WITH THIS NOTICE AND THE PROPOSED CURATIVE AFFIDAVIT.

While I encourage you to call me if you have questions, your telephone call will not be sufficient — you must write to me if you dispute the facts recited in the proposed Curative Affidavit or object to my signing and recording the Curative Affidavit.

       It is not necessary to the valid probate of a deed made by a corporation that it literally follow the statutory printed forms of this section, if it substantially complies with the law regulating the probate of a conveyance of land; and where the probate shows the acknowledgment of the president and secretary, each acting in his official capacity, or as representing the corporation, who is designated as “the grantor, for the purpose therein expressed,” it is sufficient; and the finding of the jury, upon evidence, that their officials were properly authorized to act for and in behalf of the corporation, and had so acted, and had used the word “seal,” enclosed in scroll, that had been lawfully adopted for the purpose, makes it a valid execution and probate of the deed as an act of the corporation itself; and were it otherwise, the defects as to the “seal” would seem to be cured under the provisions of

       When it does not appear from the probate of a corporation’s deed to lands that the seal affixed is the common seal of the corporation, or that it was affixed by the proper officers of the corporation, it is not a substantial compliance with this section, and the deed is ineffectual to pass title to the lands as against creditors and purchasers.

       This section originally rendered valid all probates of deeds, etc., made before the officers therein named, prior to February 12, 1872; and registrations made in pursuance of such probates were held embraced within the operation of the statutes, although made after that date, but before the enactment of the Code in 1883.

        Applicability to Defective Probates of County Courts. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was argued by counsel that this section did not refer to probates taken by the county courts, but to those of the clerks of said courts, it was held that the probates of the county courts were intended to be validated. The phraseology and punctuation, as well as the grammatical construction, of the statute, lead to that conclusion. If the other meaning had been intended, the preposition “of” would have been inserted before the words “courts of pleas and quarter sessions.” The section also validates registrations made upon such probates.

      </p>
      <p>
       At the time, and prior to the enactment of this section, deputy clerks could not take proof of deeds and other instruments requiring registration; but an erroneous impression prevailed then and before that time, that they and the judges of the courts had authority to do so, and in many instances they undertook to exercise such authority. To cure errors in this respect and render effectual many official acts done by honest misapprehension of the law, the legislature enacted this section. Tatom v. White,

       There was no intent to give efficacy and vitality to a certificate of probate or adjudication of its correctness, where the error consisted not in misconceiving the extent of the power affirmatively conferred by law, but in disregarding a plain prohibition of the statute, and committing a breach of propriety in breaking over the barriers constructed to limit their authority. It was never intended that an officer, who exercised authority in the face of a plain statutory prohibition, should under the curative provisions of this section derive benefit from thus disregarding such legal restrictions for his own advantage or convenience.
