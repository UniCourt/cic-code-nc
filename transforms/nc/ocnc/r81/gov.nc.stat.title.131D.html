       Session Laws 2009-232, s. 2, repealed Session Laws 2009-232, s. 1, contingent on House Bill 456, 2009 Regular Session, becoming law. House Bill 456 was enacted as Session Laws 2009-462. Therefore the amendment by Session Laws 2009-232, s. 1, which would have amended subdivision (b)(1a)b by deleting “and perform any required follow-up inspection” at the end of the first sentence, did not take effect.

       Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.76(a), effective August 14, 2009 until the repeal of this section, in subdivision (b)(1), in the introductory language, substituted “three hundred fifteen dollars ($315.00)” for “two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)” in the third sentence, and in the fourth sentence, substituted “three hundred sixty dollars ($360.00)” for “three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00)” near the middle, and “seventeen dollars and fifty cents ($17.50)” for “twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50)” at the end.

       It is the policy of this State to strengthen and preserve the family as a unit consistent with a high priority of protecting children’s welfare. When a child requires care outside the family unit, it is the duty of the State to assure that the quality of substitute care is as close as possible to the care and nurturing that society expects of a family. However, the State recognizes there are instances when protecting a child’s welfare outweighs reunifying the family unit, and as such, the care of residential care facilities providing high quality services that include meeting the children’s educational needs as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services can satisfy the standard of protecting a child’s welfare, regardless of the child’s age, particularly when the sibling groups can be kept intact. To that end, the General Assembly promotes the following in the provision of foster care:
       <ol>
        <li id="t131Da1As131D-10.1ol15a1">

        <li id="t131Da1As131D-10.1ol15a15">

      Session Laws
      2017-41, s. 6.1(a), (b), provides: “(a) The General Assembly recognizes that not having a drivers license is a barrier to education, employment, health care, and other community-based activities for older youth in foster care, as defined in
      G.S. 131D-10.2(9), working toward independence. One of the biggest barriers to accessing a drivers license for such youth is the ability to obtain insurance. Therefore, to assist in this effort, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, shall establish a two-year pilot program that shall reimburse, on a first-come, first-served basis, youth and caregivers’ costs associated with drivers license education, drivers license fees, insurance costs, and any other costs associated with obtaining a drivers license. The Division shall take appropriate steps to ensure proper advertising of the pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The Division of Social Services shall report on the pilot project to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services by March 1, 2018.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws
      2017-41, s. 7(a)-(c), provides: “(a) The General Assembly has determined that in an effort to maximize funding, local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) are utilizing Intensive Alternative Family Treatment (IAFT), which is a means of cost-effective, specialized foster care treatment service that is being used for many youth who would have previously been treated in Medicaid congregate care, such as psychiatric residential treatment facilities. The General Assembly finds that these higher-need youth are often (i) suspended or expelled from school or day programs and (ii) require multiple appointments on a weekly basis to address needs, such as therapy, medication management, and school individual education plans (IEPs). Further, in accordance with rules, foster parents are required to maintain outside employment while providing foster care, but the constant demands of meeting the needs of these foster youth often lead to disruption in placement as the foster parent is unable to meet those needs while maintaining the parent’s employment obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) To that end, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services (Division), shall establish a pilot program that will allow the Division to waive the employment requirement for foster parents with children utilizing the Intensive Alternative Family Treatment (IAFT). The Division shall solicit participation in the pilot program from interested local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs). The participating LME/MCOs shall conduct comparison measures between existing IAFT outcomes and those of pilots to determine any impact the waiver may have on outside employment. LME/MCOs shall measure progress of the pilot waivers based on the expectation of meeting the following outcomes:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(1) Improved placement stability with less than twenty percent (20%) of moves of youth occurring due to therapeutic foster parent request.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(2) Seventy-five percent (75%) of youth and families meeting their treatment goals within the projected time frame.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(3) No more than a ten percent (10%) increase in higher-level hospital bed days.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) LME/MCOs participating in the IAFT pilot waiver program shall provide a report on the outcomes of the pilots, along with any recommendations, to the Division. The Division shall then submit a report on the pilot waiver program to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services by December 1, 2018.”

Four counties shall participate in the pilot project, which shall include Davie, Forsyth, Rockingham, and Stokes.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The purpose of the pilot project is to establish a trauma-informed integrated health foster care model to facilitate partnerships between county departments of social services and local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) regarding children placed in foster care that will do each of the following:
     </p>

       Session Laws
       2014-100, s. 12C.1(a)-(g) provides: “(a) Findings and Intent. — The General Assembly makes the following findings:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Child Protective Services’ policy from the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, recommends that the average child protective services caseload be no greater than 10 families at any time for workers performing child protective services assessments and 10 families at any time for staff providing in-home services. However, data suggests that in 43 of the counties in this State, 21 have a caseload size of more than 15 cases per worker; and further, in nine of those 21 counties, there is an average caseload size of more than 20 cases per worker.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) During the 2013-2014 fiscal year, county departments of social services lost federal funding for child protective services under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant and Title IV-E funding. However, the number of Child Protective Services investigations has grown by twenty percent (20%) from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) There is no current, statewide data available on the performance of county departments of social services regarding child protective services.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) There exists the potential for a conflict of interest to arise when a county department of social services has been appointed as guardian for both (i) a child who is the subject of a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency that would be investigated by Child Protective Services and (ii) for the parent or legal guardian of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is the intent of the General Assembly to (i) reduce caseload size for Child Protective Services’ workers to the recommended standard, (ii) provide adequate resources for county departments of social services to provide child protective services for abused, neglected, and dependent children, (iii) provide for a comprehensive evaluation of various functions and funding regarding child protective services, and (iv) study ways to reduce conflicts of interest regarding guardianship and child protective services. To that end, the General Assembly supports the initiatives and the allocation of funds for child welfare services as described in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) Funds for Child Protective Services. — Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven million three hundred sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy dollars ($7,369,970) shall be allocated to county departments of social services. Four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) of those funds shall be used to replace federal funds counties lost during the 2013-2014 fiscal year previously used to pay for child protective services’ workers. Beginning October 1, 2014, the remaining two million eight hundred sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy dollars ($2,869,970) shall be used to provide additional funding for child protective services’ workers to reduce caseloads to an average of 10 families per worker.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) Funds for In-Home Services. — Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) shall be allocated for child welfare in-home services to provide and coordinate interventions and services that focus on child safety and protection, family preservation, and the prevention of further abuse or neglect.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) Funds for Oversight of Child Welfare Services. — Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) shall be allocated to fund nine positions to the Division to enhance oversight of child welfare services in county departments of social services. These positions shall be used to monitor, train, and provide technical assistance to the county departments of social services to ensure children and families are provided services that address the safety, permanency, and well-being of children served by child welfare services.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) Pilot Program. — Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) shall be used to establish and implement a child protective services pilot program. The funds shall be used to enhance coordination of services and information among county departments of social services, local law enforcement agencies, the court system, guardian ad litem programs, and other agencies as deemed appropriate by the Department. The Department shall determine the number of sites that may participate in the pilot program and include regions that are geographically diverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Division shall coordinate with the Government Data Analytics Center (GDAC) in developing the pilot program and commence the pilot program by December 1, 2014. The Division shall provide a progress report on the pilot program to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and the Fiscal Research Division no later than March 1, 2015. The Division shall make a final report of its findings and recommendations on the pilot program to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services no later than March 1, 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f) Statewide Evaluation. — Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000) shall be used to provide for a comprehensive, statewide evaluation of the State’s child protective services system. The Division of Social Services shall contract for an independent evaluation of the system, which evaluation shall include developing recommendations on the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) The performance of county departments of social services as related to child protective services.
      </p>
      <p>

     <p>
      “b. Services should be delivered as close as possible to the child’s home.

      “d. Services should not be provided solely for the convenience of the provider or the client.
     </p>

      “c. Clinically appropriate services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(c) The Department shall collaborate with other affected State agencies such as the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the Department of Public Instruction, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and with local departments of social services, area mental health programs, and local education agencies to eliminate cost shifting and facilitate cost-sharing among these governmental agencies with respect to the treatment and placement services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(d) The Department shall not allocate funds appropriated for Program services until a Memorandum of Agreement has been executed between the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Public Instruction, and other affected State agencies. The Memorandum of Agreement shall address specifically the roles and responsibilities of the various departmental divisions and affected State agencies involved in the administration, financing, care, and placement of children at risk of institutionalization or other out-of-home placement.

       OPINIONS OF ATTORNEY GENERAL
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section must be read in conjunction with Chapter 48 of the General Statutes which, among other things, prescribes procedures for adoptions; it is clear that placement for adoption has a much broader meaning than mere physical receipt or placement. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnston Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 27 (1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      The words “place” or “placement,” when used in the context of adoptions, refer to greater involvement in the adoption process than the physical delivery of a child to his adoptive parents. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnson Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 27 (1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      Reading this section in the context of the chapter on licensing and inspection of child placing agencies leads to the conclusion that this section was not intended to address the situation in which a hospital employee, with no involvement in the arrangement of adoption, simply delivers an infant to adoptive parents. In addition, the language “in . . . adoptive homes” goes beyond what a hospital employee does when he releases a new born child to an adoptive parent; consequently, a hospital’s discharge of an infant to adoptive parents does not constitute a violation of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnston Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 27 (1989).

        “Adult care home” is an assisted living residence in which the housing management provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled personal care services to two or more residents, either directly or, for scheduled needs, through formal written agreement with licensed home care or hospice agencies. Some licensed adult care homes provide supervision to persons with cognitive impairments whose decisions, if made independently, may jeopardize the safety or well-being of themselves or others and therefore require supervision. Medication in an adult care home may be administered by designated, trained staff. Adult care homes that provide care to two to six unrelated residents are commonly called family care homes. Adult care homes and family care homes are subject to licensure by the Division of Health Service Regulation.

       Statement of Purpose. —  It is the intention of the General Assembly that community advisory committee members function as representatives of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and through their designation work to maintain the intent of the Adult Care Home Residents’ Bill of Rights within the licensed adult care homes in this State. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the committees promote community involvement and cooperation with adult care homes to ensure quality care for the elderly and adults with disabilities.

       Establishment and Appointment of Committees. —
       <ol>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b1">
         A community advisory committee shall be established in each county that has at least one licensed adult care home, shall serve all the homes in the county, and shall work with each of these homes for the best interests of the residents. In a county that has one, two, or three adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have five members.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b12">
         In a county with four or more adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have one additional member for each adult care home with 10 or more beds in excess of three, and may have up to five additional members at the discretion of the county commissioners, not to exceed a maximum of 25 members. In each county with four or more adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall establish a subcommittee of no more than five members and no fewer than three members from the committee for each adult care home in the county. Each member must serve on at least one subcommittee.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b13">
         In counties with no adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have five members. Regardless of how many members a particular community advisory committee is required to have, at least one member of each committee shall be a person involved in the area of intellectual or other developmental disabilities.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b14">
         The boards of county commissioners are encouraged to appoint the adult care home community advisory committees. Of the members, a minority (not less than one-third, but as close to one-third as possible) shall be chosen from among persons nominated by a majority of the chief administrators of adult care homes in the county. If the adult care home administrators fail to make a nomination within 45 days after written notification has been sent to them requesting a nomination, these appointments may be made without nominations. If the county commissioners fail to appoint members to a committee, the appointments shall be made by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman no sooner than 45 days after nominations have been requested from the adult care home administrators. In making appointments, the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman shall follow the same appointment process as that specified for the county commissioners.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b15">
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, appointment to an adult care home community advisory committee is contingent upon designation of the appointee by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman in accordance with G.S. 143B-181.18. A designated appointee is directly accountable to the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program in order to perform the duties as a representative of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Removal of the appointee’s designation by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman automatically rescinds the appointment to the adult care home community advisory committee.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2b16">
         Any individual who serves as a community advisory committee member must go through the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s certification and designation process and meet the certification and designation requirements in accordance with the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Policies and Procedures.

       Joint Nursing and Adult Care Home Community Advisory Committees. —  Appointment to the nursing home community advisory committees shall preclude appointment to the adult care home community advisory committees except where written approval to combine these committees is obtained from the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Where this approval is obtained, the joint nursing and adult care home community advisory committee shall have the membership required of nursing home community advisory committees and one additional member for each adult care home with 10 or more beds licensed in the county. In counties with no adult care homes with 10 or more beds, there shall be one additional member for every four other types of adult care homes in the county. In no case shall the number of members on the joint nursing and adult care home community advisory committee exceed 25. Each member shall exercise the statutory rights and responsibilities of both nursing home community advisory committees and adult care home community advisory committees. In making appointments to this joint committee, the county commissioners shall solicit nominations from both nursing and adult care home administrators for the appointment of approximately (but no more than) one-third of the members.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2d">
       Terms of Office. —  Each committee member shall serve an initial term of one year. Any person reappointed to a second or subsequent term in the same county shall serve a two-or three-year term at the county commissioners’ discretion to ensure staggered terms of office.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2e">
       Vacancies. —  Any vacancy shall be filled by appointment of a person for a one-year term. If this vacancy is in a position filled by an appointee nominated by the chief administrators of adult care homes within the county, then the county commissioners shall fill the vacancy from persons nominated by a majority of the chief administrators. If the adult care home administrators fail to make a nomination by registered mail within 45 days after written notification has been sent to them requesting a nomination, this appointment may be made without nominations. If the county commissioners fail to fill a vacancy, the vacancy shall be filled by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman no sooner than 45 days after the commissioners have been notified of the appointment or vacancy.

      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2g">
       Minimum Qualifications for Appointment. —  Each member must be a resident of the county which the committee serves. No person or immediate family member of a person with a financial interest in a home served by the committee, or employee or governing board member of a home served by the committee, or immediate family member of a resident in a home served by the committee may be a member of that committee. Any county commissioner who is appointed to the committee serves on the committee in an ex officio capacity. Members of the committee shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. The names of the committee members and the date of expiration of their terms shall be filed with the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman.

      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol2h">
       Training, Certification, and Designation. —  The Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman shall develop training requirements for certification and designation in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 1324.13(c)(2).

       § 131D-45.
     Examination and screening for the presence of controlled substances required for applicants for employment in adult care homes.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9a">
       An offer of employment by an adult care home licensed under this Article to an applicant is conditioned on the applicant’s consent to an examination and screening for controlled substances. The examination and screening shall be conducted in accordance with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes. A screening procedure that utilizes a single-use test device may be used for the examination and screening of applicants and may be administered on-site. If the results of the applicant’s examination and screening indicate the presence of a controlled substance, the adult care home shall not employ the applicant unless the applicant first provides to the adult care home written verification from the applicant’s prescribing physician that every controlled substance identified by the examination and screening is prescribed by that physician to treat the applicant’s medical or psychological condition. The verification from the physician shall include the name of the controlled substance, the prescribed dosage and frequency, and the condition for which the substance is prescribed. If the result of an applicant’s or employee’s examination and screening indicates the presence of a controlled substance, the adult care home may require a second examination and screening to verify the results of the prior examination and screening.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9b">
       An adult care home may require random examination and screening for controlled substances as a condition of continued employment. If the adult care home has reasonable grounds to believe that an employee is an abuser of a controlled substance, the adult care home may require that employee to undergo examination and screening for controlled substances as a condition of continued employment.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9c">
       An adult care home and an officer or employee of an adult care home that, in good faith, complies with this section is not liable for the failure of the adult care home to employ or continue the employment of an individual on the basis of the results of an examination and screening of the applicant or employee for controlled substances.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9d">
       An entity and officers and employees of an entity that perform controlled substance examination and screening in accordance with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes shall be immune from civil liability for conducting or failing to conduct the examination and screening if the examination and screening are requested and received in compliance with this section and with Article 20 of Chapter 95 of the General Statutes.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9e">
       The results of an examination and screening conducted at the request of an adult care home in accordance with this section are confidential and not a public record under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes. The adult care home shall maintain the confidentiality of all information related to the examination and screening of an applicant for employment or an individual currently employed by the adult care home.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da05s131D-45ol9f">
       The adult care home shall pay expenses related to controlled substance examination and screening pursuant to this section, except examinee-requested retests. The examinee shall pay all reasonable expenses for retests of confirmed positive results.
