    At common law, marriage was an absolute gift to the husband of all the personal property of the wife in possession, and the same became his property instantly on the marriage; and it was a qualified gift of all the personal property adversely held, and all the choses in action of the wife, which became the husband’s absolutely upon his reduction of the same into possession, during coverture, with the right in case the wife died to administer on her estate, and in that character to collect, and after payment of her debts to hold the surplus to his own use, without obligation to distribute to anyone. O'Connor v. Harris,

    At common law it was competent to the husband having choses in action “jure mariti” to assign the same for value, or as a security to pay his debts, and the assignment availed to pass the right to the assignee to collect and have the proceeds as his absolute property, if collected during coverture, just as the husband might have done if he had kept and reduced it into possession himself.

     Wife May Hold Legal as Well as Equitable Estate. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, a married woman has or can have the legal as well as the equitable estate. Sanderlin v. Sanderlin,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     122 N.C. 1

     N.C. LEXIS 183
    </cite>
    (1898).
   </p>
   <p>
    Prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1868 it was held that deeds by which property was conveyed to a trustee for the sole and separate use of a married woman created an active trust in the trustee, and this was held because otherwise the statute would execute the use, and the husband would, as husband, become vested with rights in and control over his wife’s property. But by the Constitution of 1868, as declared in Walker v. Long,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     109 N.C. 510
    </cite>
    , 14 S.E. 299, 1891, the wife’s property was rendered secure to her, and not subject to the control of, or to the debts or obligations of, her husband. Thus, it was no longer necessary to invoke the fiction of the law in order to protect the wife’s property from the husband or his creditors in deeds made subsequent to the adoption of that Constitution.

   <p>
    Money received by the husband from a sale of the wife’s lands before the adoption of the Constitution in 1868 belonged to him absolutely, unless at the time he received it he agreed to invest it for her in some other way. But if the wife acquired the title and the marriage occurred prior to 1868, and the sale was made subsequent to that time, the proceeds would be her separate estate; and if the husband purchased other lands with such proceeds and took title in his own name, in the absence of any special agreement to the contrary, he would become a trustee for her.

    Under the change made in the law of married women’s property rights by this section and N.C. Const., Art. X, § 4, where a married woman receives checks from her parents as personal gifts to her, which she endorses and delivers to her husband, there is a presumption that he receives the money in trust for her, and in the absence of evidence that it was a gift, she may recover the same in her action against him, or, after his death, against his personal representative.

   <p>
    Laws 1871-1872, c. 193, s. 17, known as the Marriage Act, was the first legislation directly regulating the power of a married woman to make contracts. It seems that the only change made by this act was that the consent of the husband in writing was required in order to allow her to charge her separate estate. See
    Arrington v. Bell,
    <cite class="nc_code">
     94 N.C. 247
    </cite>
    (1886). However, a subsequent statute, known as the Martin Act, was passed March 6, 1911, and entirely changed the law. See
    13 N.C.L. Rev. 62. The present section, except insofar as it is not limited to married women, is similar to the Martin Act.

    <b>
     Common Law. —

   </p>
   <p>
    At common law, the contract of a married woman was void, but it was held in equity that she might have an estate settled to her separate use, and that although she had no power to bind herself personally, she might with the concurrence of the trustee specifically charge her separate estate, and the courts of equity would enforce the charge against the property. But her contracts, in order to create a charge, had to refer expressly, or by necessary implication, to the separate estate as a means of payment, this being in the nature of an appointment or appropriation.

    The restraints upon a married woman’s power to contract rest upon statute, not upon the Constitution, and of course can be removed by statute.

    This section is in accord with the realistic trend of the modern decisions, which recognize the fact that a wife, as an individual, has a personal right to work and earn money, whether she is gainfully employed at the time or engaged merely in the performance of household duties; and where her capacity to work and earn money is impaired by injury, she has suffered a definite, substantial loss.

    North Carolina law has long recognized that the husband’s (supporting spouse’s) duty of support may be discharged by a valid separation agreement between the spouses under which fixed benefits are provided the wife (dependent spouse) in consideration of the discharge.

    The language of a separation agreement that the husband released “all rights” that he might have “in any estate” of his wife at her death was sufficient to support the conclusion that a release of his former right of tenancy by the curtesy was intended. The word “estate” was comprehensive enough to include land. Blankenship v. Blankenship,

   <p>
    Assuming that a provision in a separation agreement was intended by the husband and the wife to address their right to exclusive sexual intercourse with the other, the provision related only to the spouses’ rights against each other, and, as a matter of law, the provision did not waive the parties’ rights, with respect to third parties, for purposes of a criminal conversation claim.

    To be valid, a separation agreement must be untainted by fraud,

    When a prior separation agreement fully disposes of the spouses’ property rights arising out of the marriage, it acts as a bar to equitable distribution. Blount v. Blount, 72 N.C. App. 193, 323 S.E.2d 738,

    Separation agreement entered into on August 2, 1982, which contained no reference to defendant-husband’s military pension, but specifically provided that each party was forever barred from any or all rights or claims not therein reserved which arose out of the marital relation and that each released and relinquished all claims or interest in and to all property of the other, whether then owned or subsequently acquired, barred an award to plaintiff-wife under the Equitable Distribution Act of a share in defendant-husband’s military pension; the subsequent amendment of the act effective August 1, 1983, to include military pensions as marital property did not permit plaintiff-wife to avoid the release provisions of the agreement.

    At common law, husband was liable for the tort of his wife, although committed without his knowledge or consent and in his absence, and although husband and wife were living separate at the time, on the ground that as her legal existence was incorporated in that of her husband, she could not be sued alone, and if the husband was protected from responsibility the injured party would be without redress.

     Alienation of Affection And Criminal Conversation Facially Valid. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Common law causes of action for alienation of affection and criminal conversation are facially valid because they further the State’s desire to protect a married couple’s vow of fidelity and to prevent the personal injury and societal harms that result when that vow is broke; when spouses agree to an “open” marriage that permits extra-marital intimacy or sex, that is a defense to the claims, as is physical separation of the spouses when either intends for the separation to remain permanent.

     Post-Separation Conduct. —

    Trial court properly awarded the plaintiff $65,000 for criminal conversation and alienation of affection because, while the defendant claimed not to know who the father of her child was, the trial court found otherwise based on evidence including the plaintiff’s testimony and inconsistencies in the defendant’s testimony, evidence of post-separation conduct between the defendant and the husband corroborated evidence of their pre-separation conduct, including allowing a reasonable inference that the defendant was the unidentified woman who accompanied the husband to a hotel on one occasion and that she engaged in sexual intercourse with him on that occasion, a few weeks before he and the plaintiff separated.

     Relief from Automatic Stay in Bankruptcy Cases. —

    Bankruptcy court granted a husband’s motion seeking relief under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(d)(1) so he could proceed with a lawsuit he filed in a North Carolina court which alleged that a Chapter 13 debtor committed alienation of affection and criminal conversation when he had an affair with the husband’s wife. Alienation of affection and criminal conversation were valid claims under

    , the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to hear the husband’s state-law claims absent consent by both parties and maybe not even then, the State court was a better forum than the bankruptcy court for resolving the debtor’s claim that claims alleging alienation of affection and criminal conversation under North Carolina law were unconstitutional, the parties had already filed their pleadings and conducted discovery in the husband’s case in State court, and the debtor’s bankruptcy estate could be protected by imposing a requirement that the husband seek enforcement of any judgment he obtained in State court through the bankruptcy court.
