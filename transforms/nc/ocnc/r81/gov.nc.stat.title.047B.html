     Declaration of policy and statement of purpose.

   <p>
    It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina that:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol11">
     Land is a basic resource of the people of the State of North Carolina and should be made freely alienable and marketable so far as is practicable.
    </li>
    <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol12">
     Nonpossessory interests in real property, obsolete restrictions and technical defects in titles which have been placed on the real property records at remote times in the past often constitute unreasonable restraints on the alienation and marketability of real property.
    </li>
    <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol13">
     Such interests and defects are prolific producers of litigation to clear and quiet titles which cause delays in real property transactions and fetter the marketability of real property.
    </li>
    <li id="t47Bs47B-1ol14">
     Real property transfers should be possible with economy and expediency. The status and security of recorded real property titles should be determinable from an examination of recent records only.
     <p>
      It is the purpose of the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina to provide that if a person claims title to real property under a chain of record title for 30 years, and no other person has filed a notice of any claim of interest in the real property during the 30-year period, then all conflicting claims based upon any title transaction prior to the 30-year period shall be extinguished.

   <p>
    Under this Chapter, if a person or those under whom he claims has a record title to real property of at least 30 years duration and there is nothing of record which by a title search of that chain would show a defect in the title, such a person has a marketable title in the property.

    In order to prove title to land under the Real Property Marketable Title Act,
    
    defendant had to establish: (1) that defendant, alone or together with his predecessors in title, was vested with an estate in real property which had been of record for at least thirty years; (2) the public record showed a title transaction at least thirty years old which purported to vest title in defendant or some other person from whom, by one or more title transactions, the property had passed to defendant; and (3) that nothing appeared of record to divest defendant of the estate.

    In order to establish title under the Real Property Marketable Title Act, a person must establish that (1) he alone or together with his predecessors in title, was vested with an estate in real property which had been of record for at least 30 years; (2) the public record showed a title transaction at least 30 years old which purported to vest title in him or some other person from whom, by one or more title transactions, the property had passed to him; and (3) that nothing appeared of record to divest him of that estate.

   <p>
    Trial court erred by applying G.S. 47B-3(3) in action to quiet title and by granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendant possessor where the claimants established prima facie ownership by presenting exhibits of plats showing their respective chains of title of more than 30 years from a grantor. The fact that the defendant was in fact in possession was not enough to resolve the factual dispute as the burden shifted to the defendant to defeat the plaintiffs’ claims. Hill v. Taylor, 174 N.C.

    In a case in which the State of North Carolina sought a declaratory judgment that it owned a 45-mile segment of the riverbed of the Yadkin River in North Carolina that, over the past 100 years, a power company purportedly acquired by deed and developed, the federal district court properly concluded the company proved its title to 99% of the relevant segment’s riverbed under the Marketable Title Act (MTA). The district court found and North Carolina conceded that the company demonstrated satisfaction of its burden of proof under the statutory requirements of the MTA. North Carolina v. Alcoa Power Generating, 853 F.3d 140, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 5691 (4th Cir. 2017), modified, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 8226 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 981, 200 L.

   </p>
   <p>
    District court properly found that the company had title to a 45-mile segment of the riverbed that it had purportedly acquired by deed and developed because the record supported the district court’s treatment of the relevant segment as a single segment, North Carolina did not obtain title to the riverbeds of the relevant segment by virtue of sovereignty because the relevant segment was not navigable at statehood, the company proved its title to 99% of the relevant segment’s riverbed under North Carolina’s Real Property Marketable Title Act and no exception applied, and the company proved title to the remaining one percent under adverse possession.

     Effect of Defendants’ Possession on Rights of Ownership. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Whatever rights the defendants have because they are in possession of property are not taken away by a competing marketable record title, but the mere fact of possession by the defendants does not alone establish their ownership of the land. Possession only protects whatever ownership the defendants already have on the date that marketability is to be determined. Heath v. Turner,

   </p>
   <p>
    Trial court erred by applying G.S. 47B-3(3) in action to quiet title and by granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendant possessor where the claimants established prima facie ownership by presenting exhibits of plats showing their respective chains of title of more than 30 years from a grantor. The fact that the defendant was in fact in possession was not enough to resolve the factual dispute as the burden shifted to the defendant to defeat the plaintiffs’ claims. Hill v. Taylor, 174 N.C. App. 415, 621 S.E.2d 284,

     Title Acquired by Adverse Possession Protected. —

   <p>
    Where the defendants had acquired title to an undivided interest by adverse possession when the action was filed, their possession of the property on the date that marketability was to be determined (the date the action was filed) protected their rights as owners of the undivided interest. Thus, even if the plaintiffs had a marketable record title on that date under this Chapter, it could not affect or extinguish the defendants’ title previously acquired by adverse possession because that title was an interest protected by subdivision (3) of this section.
