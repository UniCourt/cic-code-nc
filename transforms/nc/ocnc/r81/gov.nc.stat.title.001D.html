    Evidence supported an award of punitive damages in the amount of $50,000 because (1) a debtor’s conduct when it moved an auto dealership’s vehicles without authorization was willful and wanton; (2) an officer of the debtor participated in and condoned the conduct; (3) the debtor set out to deliberately damage the dealership’s property as the dealership’s operators were caring for their ailing and elderly father; (4) the testimony of the debtor’s employees clearly established that the debtor was aware that its conduct was inflicting serious harm as it was occurring; (5) the clear indifference of the debtor’s directors regarding the continuing damage to the dealership’s property resulting from the debtor’s willful and wanton conduct was exceptional; and (6) the dealership was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $372,489.

    Claim for punitive damages against a singer, arising from an alleged battery, survived the author’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under N.C. R. Civ.

    Contrary to the corporation’s argument, the patron was not required to prove that the willful and wanton conduct caused the patron’s injuries, but rather was required to prove a connection between that conduct and her injuries and the evidence was sufficient to show a connection between the failure to investigate what the patron drank and her injuries. A jury could also find a connection between the evidence of the patron’s emotional injuries and the assistant manager’s deliberate disregard of the need to obtain information regarding what the patron swallowed.

    Although the assistant manager knew the patron ingested some unknown substance that had made her sick, he refused to find out what she had actually been served or the first aid protocol for that substance before completing the corporation’s incident report form; moreover, that form was not designed to provide assistance to the customer, but was focused on anticipating litigation. A jury could reasonably find from the evidence that the assistant manager chose to give preference to protecting the corporation from possible litigation over providing assistance to the patron who had been served a possibly toxic substance; the jury could then further conclude that the assistant manager acted with conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the patron’s rights and safety, thus supporting a finding of willful or wanton conduct.

    Evidence supported an award of punitive damages in the amount of $50,000 because (1) a debtor’s conduct when it moved an auto dealership’s vehicles without authorization was willful and wanton; (2) an officer of the debtor participated in and condoned the conduct; (3) the debtor set out to deliberately damage the dealership’s property as the dealership’s operators were caring for their ailing and elderly father; (4) the testimony of the debtor’s employees clearly established that the debtor was aware that its conduct was inflicting serious harm as it was occurring; (5) the clear indifference of the debtor’s directors regarding the continuing damage to the dealership’s property resulting from the debtor’s willful and wanton conduct was exceptional; and (6) the dealership was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $372,489.

    As the jury awarded the patron $10,000 in compensatory damages, the trial court reduced the jury’s punitive damages award of $350,000 to $250,000 in accordance with G.S. 1D-25(b); in light of the reprehensibility of the corporation’s conduct, the relatively low ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, and the civil and criminal sanctions that might have been imposed for similar conduct, the trial court did not err in determining that the punitive damages award did not violate the corporation’s due process rights.

    An award of punitive damages of $500,000 to the former wife against the current wife for alienation of affections and criminal conversion was not excessive, considering that the jury awarded the same amount in compensatory damages, and thus, could have awarded $1,500,000 in punitive damages.

    When an employer sued a competitor for involvement in the employer’s former employees’ employment contract violations, a punitive damages award erred because, when a trial court concluded each defendant engaged in conduct warranting such damages, the court improperly considered relevant factors not as to each plaintiff’s cause of action, as required, but as to each defendant.

    Evidence supported an award of punitive damages in the amount of $50,000 because (1) a debtor’s conduct when it moved an auto dealership’s vehicles without authorization was willful and wanton; (2) an officer of the debtor participated in and condoned the conduct; (3) the debtor set out to deliberately damage the dealership’s property as the dealership’s operators were caring for their ailing and elderly father; (4) the testimony of the debtor’s employees clearly established that the debtor was aware that its conduct was inflicting serious harm as it was occurring; (5) the clear indifference of the debtor’s directors regarding the continuing damage to the dealership’s property resulting from the debtor’s willful and wanton conduct was exceptional; and (6) the dealership was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $372,489.

    to award punitive damages, the court considered the following factors: the debtor’s behavior and the motives that prompted it were reprehensible; the likelihood of causing serious harm to the creditor was high, a fact of which the debtor was not only aware, but which he in fact sought to accomplish; the debtor caused the creditor to incur at least a moderate drop in his income; the debtor stood to gain by persuading the public and other doctors to avoid the creditor as a physician; the debtor’s current earnings, as well as his earning potential, were such that he was able to pay punitive damages; and the debtor would, unless it was otherwise made abundantly clear, persist in his public campaign of disinformation with respect to the creditor.

    supported the award of attorneys’ fees to a homeowners association and board members attorneys’ fees because the trial court dismissed homeowners’ punitive damages claim under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12; in awarding attorneys’ fees, the record showed that the trial court was considering the award as it was ruling on the associations’ motion to dismiss the homeowners’ various counterclaims and defenses under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12 and 41, and that included a ruling as to punitive damages. Moss Creek Homeowners Ass'n v. Bissette, 202 N.C. App. 222, 689 S.E.2d 180,

     Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys’ Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys’ fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys’ fee calculation.

   <p>
    As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys’ fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys’ fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys’ fees.

    Although attorneys’ fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys’ fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise reasonable attorneys’ fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys’ fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.
