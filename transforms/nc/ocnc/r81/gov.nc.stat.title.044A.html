       For priority purposes, liens duly perfected under this Chapter relate back to the time of first furnishing labor or materials. As between a statutory lien and the lien created by a deed of trust, the general rule is that the lien which is first in time has priority. RDC, Inc. v. Brookleigh Bldrs., Inc., 60 N.C.

       Defendant properly met the requirements of this chapter, and judgment signed by trial judge properly referred to the site upon which defendant wanted a lien declared and related the lien back to the date when labor and materials were first furnished at the site; therefore, defendant’s lien had priority over the deed of trust held by plaintiff.

If the tenant has vacated the premises for 21 or more days after the expiration of the paid rental period, or if the lessor has received a judgment for possession of the premises which is executable and the tenant has vacated the premises, then all property remaining on the premises may be removed and placed in storage. If the total value of all property remaining on the premises is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), then it shall be deemed abandoned five days after the tenant has vacated the premises, and the lessor may remove it and may donate it to any charitable institution or organization.

This lien shall be for the amount of any rents which were due the lessor at the time the tenant vacated the premises and for the time, up to 60 days, from the vacating of the premises to the date of sale; and for any sums necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant, normal wear and tear excepted; and for reasonable costs and expenses of sale.

       While a mechanic who performed a diagnostic analysis of an automobile had a valid lien against the credit union that financed the purchase of the automobile and repossessed the automobile from the mechanic’s premises late at night without the mechanic’s knowledge or consent, the trial court erred in awarding the mechanic actual and treble damages, as the mechanic’s proper remedy was to be awarded possession of the automobile.

       When plaintiff filed motion to amend his complaint to add a cause of action to enforce a materialman’s or laborer’s lien on December 8, 1983, and the last day he had furnished material or labor to defendants’ property was June 15, 1983, his motion was filed within the 180-day period set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the date of the filing of the motion, rather than the date the court rules on it, being the crucial date in measuring the period of limitations.

       Enforcement by Sale. —  If the charges for which the lien is claimed under this Article remain unpaid or unsatisfied for 30 days or, in the case of towing and storage charges on a motor vehicle, 10 days following the maturity of the obligation to pay any such charges, the lienor may enforce the lien by public or private sale as provided in this section. The lienor may bring an action on the debt in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time following maturity of the obligation. Failure of the lienor to bring such action within a 180-day period following the commencement of storage shall constitute a waiver of any right to collect storage charges which accrue after such period. Provided that when property is placed in storage pursuant to an express contract of storage, the lien shall continue and the lienor may bring an action to collect storage charges and enforce his lien at any time within 120 days following default on the obligation to pay storage charges.The owner or person with whom the lienor dealt may at any time following the maturity of the obligation bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction as by law provided. If in any such action the owner or other party requests immediate possession of the property and pays the amount of the lien asserted into the clerk of the court in which such action is pending, the clerk shall issue an order to the lienor to relinquish possession of the property to the owner or other party. The request for immediate possession may be made in the complaint, which shall also set forth the amount of the asserted lien and the portion thereof which is not in dispute, if any.

The clerk may at any time disburse to the lienor that portion of the cash bond, which the plaintiff says in his complaint is not in dispute, upon application of the lienor. The magistrate or judge shall direct appropriate disbursement of the disputed or undisbursed portion of the bond in the judgment of the court. In the event an action by the owner pursuant to this section is heard in district or superior court, the substantially prevailing party in such court may be awarded a reasonable attorney’s fee in the discretion of the judge.

Gen. Stat. ch. 44A, Article 2, that is, the contract between the lienor and the owner of real property; if the judgment is awarding the lienor the principal amount due under his contract with the property owner, the interest included in that “principal amount” would be the interest due under the contract with the property owner, and clearly, then, the requirement of an agreement on interest between the parties refers to the agreement between the lienor and the owner of the property.

        Priority of Purchase Money Deed of Trust Under Doctrine of Instantaneous Seisin. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A materialman’s lien relates back and takes effect from the time of the first furnishing of materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the lien. While the statutory language does not indicate the precise moment of attachment, it does indicate an order of priority between competing lien claimants. That priority can be defeated by the application of the doctrine of instantaneous seisin. Such doctrine provides that when a deed and a purchase money deed of trust are executed, delivered, and recorded as part of the same transaction, the deed of trust attaches at the instant the vendee acquires title and constitutes a lien superior to all others. It would thus subordinate a previously existing materialman’s lien. Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., 72 N.C. App. 224, 324 S.E.2d 626,

       Policy supporting the doctrine of instantaneous seisin
       
       is that a vendor who parts with property and supplies the purchase price does so on the basis of having a first priority security interest in the property. The vendor who advances purchase money relies on the assurance that he or she will be able to foreclose on the land if the purchase price is not repaid. It is thus equitable and just that the vendor have a first priority security interest and be protected from the possibility of losing both the land and the money in the transaction. Carolina Bldrs.

        No Contractual Relationship Established. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because there was no contractual relationship between a contractor and a county, the contractor could not enforce a lien on real property conveyed to the county; the contractor executed a waiver of its materialmen’s lien rights within a development and sought to enforce a lien on the property for work performed after the lien waiver was signed and after the property was conveyed to the county, but the contractor did not allege a contractual relationship between it and the county, and absent such a relationship, it could not enforce a lien on county real property.

       Where and When Action Commenced. —  An action to enforce a claim of lien on real property may be commenced in any county where venue is otherwise proper. No such action may be commenced later than 180 days after the last furnishing of labor or materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the claim of lien on real property. If the title to the real property against which the claim of lien on real property is asserted is by law vested in a receiver or is subject to the control of the bankruptcy court, the claim of lien on real property shall be enforced in accordance with the orders of the court having jurisdiction over said real property. The filing of a proof of claim with a receiver or in bankruptcy and the filing of a notice of lis pendens in each county where the real property subject to the claim of lien on real property is located within the time required by this section satisfies the requirement for the commencement of a civil action.

       Notice of Action. —  In order for the sale under G.S. 44A-14(a) to pass all title and interest of the owner to the purchaser good against all claims or interests recorded, filed or arising after the first furnishing of labor or materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the claim of lien on real property, a notice of lis pendens shall be filed in each county in which the real property subject to the claim of lien on real property is located except the county in which the action is commenced. The notice of lis pendens shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section for the commencement of the action by the lien claimant. If neither an action nor a notice of lis pendens is filed in accordance with this section, the judgment entered in the action enforcing the claim of lien on real property shall not direct a sale of the real property subject to the claim of lien on real property enforced thereby nor be entitled to any priority under the provisions of G.S. 44A-14(a), but shall be entitled only to those priorities accorded by law to money judgments.

Stat. ch. 44A, Article 2, that is, the contract between the lienor and the owner of real property; if the judgment is awarding the lienor the principal amount due under his contract with the property owner, the interest included in that “principal amount” would be the interest due under the contract with the property owner, and clearly, then, the requirement of an agreement on interest between the parties refers to the agreement between the lienor and the owner of the property.

       Subcontractor who receives payments from a contractor within 90 days of the contractor’s filing for bankruptcy does not perfect his lien by the mere receipt and possession of the payments; he must still file the statutory notice in order to become a secured creditor and protect his receipt of payments from avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee.

       expressly preserves the rights of a first, second or third tier subcontractor to enforce the lien of the general contractor. This construction is supported by the inclusion of the language that upon filing of the notice and claim of lien “no action of the contractor shall be effective to prejudice the rights of the subcontractor without his written consent.” This language, not found in this section, indicates that the legislature intended for the subcontractor to be secured by a mechanic’s lien to the full extent of his claim.

       Trial court’s conclusion that a subcontractor’s notice of claim of lien was properly made to the record owner was not erroneous because the admissions in the pleadings of an owner and a general contractor showed that the notice and the claim of lien were properly served and filed; in the original answer and answer to the subcontractor’s amended complaint, it was admitted that the owner was served by certified mail to its registered agent a copy of the notice of claim of lien and claim of lien, and although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, the owner and contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose.

       Subcontractor’s claim of lien was properly filed because although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, an owner and general contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose; the subcontractor failed to state why it was entitled to a lien on real property pursuant to G.S. 44A-20(d), but in the answer of the owner and contractor, it was admitted that the subcontractor made repeated demands for payment on numerous occasions, which were denied based upon the subcontractor’s alleged failure to complete all of the work and to complete the work in a workmanlike manner.

     <p>
      If any contractor or other person receiving payment from an obligor for an improvement to real property or from a purchaser for a conveyance of real property with improvements subject to this Article or to Article 3 of this Chapter shall knowingly furnish to such obligor, purchaser, or to a lender who obtains a security interest in said real property, or to a title insurance company insuring title to such real property, a false written statement of the sums due or claimed to be due for labor or material furnished at the site of improvements to such real property, then such contractor, subcontractor or other person shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Upon conviction and in the event the court shall grant any defendant a suspended sentence, the court may in its discretion include as a condition of such suspension a provision that the defendant shall reimburse the party who suffered loss on such conditions as the court shall determine are proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The elements of the offense herein stated are the furnishing of the false written statement with knowledge that it is false and the subsequent or simultaneous receipt of payment from an obligor or purchaser by the person signing the document, a person directing another to sign the document, or any person or entity for whom the document was signed. In any criminal prosecution hereunder it shall not be necessary for the State to prove that the obligor, purchaser, lender or title insurance company relied upon the false statement or that any person was injured thereby.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the criminal sanctions created by this section, conduct constituting the offense herein stated and causing actual harm to any person by any licensed contractor or qualifying party, as that term is used in Chapter 87 of the General Statutes, shall constitute deceit and misconduct subject to disciplinary action under Chapter 87 of the General Statutes, including revocation, suspension, or restriction of a license or the ability to act as a qualifying party for a license.

        Right of Materialman Who Furnishes Material to Subcontractor to Recover. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Neither actual delivery of material to a prime contract job site nor incorporation of the material into the work affects a materialman’s right to recover under the contractor’s payment bond; in order for a materialman who furnishes a subcontractor with materials for use on a public project to recover against a prime contractor’s payment bond pursuant to this Article, it is only necessary that the materialman has sold and delivered the materials to the subcontractor in good faith and under the reasonable belief that these materials were for ultimate use under the prime contract.

       Appellate court does not find that a final completion requirement needs to be implied into G.S. 44A-28(b) since the doctrine of substantial completion adequately addresses concerns that there could be a final ascertainment of the amount due immediately on the execution of a contract; certainly a project must be substantially complete before a governmental agency is capable of administratively fixing the amount it is bound to pay, however, the North Carolina legislature does not expressly require the contract to be 100-percent completed before the government may determine the final settlement, and the appellate court does not import this language into North Carolina law.

       It is true that the government’s retainage of funds casts doubt on whether its payment was intended to be a genuinely “final payment” for purposes of determining a final settlement under G.S. 44A-28(b); however, final payment and final settlement are not synonymous, and while retainage directly affects final payment, it does not have a similar impact on final settlement. A governmental entity may administratively fix the amount it is bound to pay, and then retain a portion of that payment to ensure not only that the contractor completes the entire project, including the punch-list, but also that no liens are outstanding.
