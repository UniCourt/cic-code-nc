       The Workers’ Compensation Act is a compromise
       
       arrived at through the concessions of employees and employers alike. Nothing in it supports the notion that it was enacted just for the protection of careful, prudent employees, or that employees that do not stick strictly to their business are beyond its protection. By its terms, with certain exceptions the act applies to all employees who work for employers with the requisite number of employees and are injured by accident during the course of and arising from their employment; and it is not required that the employment be the sole proximate cause of the injury, it being enough that any reasonable relationship to the employment exists, or employment is a contributory cause. Bare v. Wayne Poultry Co., 70 N.C. App. 88, 318 S.E.2d 534,

       The philosophy which supports the Workers’ Compensation Act
       
       is that the wear and tear of human beings in modern industry should be charged to the industry, just as the wear and tear of machinery has always been charged. Vause v. Vause Farm Equip. Co.,

       While compensation is presumably charged to the industry, and consequently to the employer or owner of the industry, eventually it becomes a part of the fair money cost of the industrial product, to be paid for by the general public patronizing such products. Vause v. Vause Farm Equip. Co.,

       The Workers’ Compensation Act deals with the incidents and risks of the contract of employment, in which is included the negligence of the employer in that relation. It has no application outside the field of industrial accident, and does not intend, by its general terms, to take away common-law or other rights which pertain to the parties as members of the general public, disconnected from the employment.

       The Workers’ Compensation Act takes into consideration certain elements of a mutual concession between the employer and employee by which the question of negligence is eliminated, and liability under the act rests upon the employer upon the condition precedent of an injury by accident occurring in the course of employment and arising out of it.

       Workers’ compensation laws are a statutory compromise which assure workers’ compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment without their having to prove negligence on the part of the employer. In exchange for the employer’s loss of common law defenses, however, the employee gives up his right to common-law verdicts. In effect, tort liability was replaced with no-fault liability. Andrews v. Peters, 55 N.C. App. 124, 284 S.E.2d 748,

       It is generally conceded by all courts that the various compensation acts were intended to eliminate the fault of the workman as a basis for denying recovery. In other words, a workman is entitled to recover irrespective of fault if the injury arises out of and in the course of the employment. The doctrine of horseplay, which excludes a workman from compensation, although he is not at fault, and does not engage therein, is inconsistent with the underlying philosophy of compensation acts, which are designed for the very purpose of eliminating fault as a basis for determining liability.

       Trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of municipal defendants in an action alleging gross negligence and wanton misconduct in the death of decedent while employed by defendants caused when a dumpster on a garbage truck partially detached and pinned decedent against the side of the truck. Although the North Carolina Workers Compensation Act is the sole remedy in most cases for employees who suffer employment-related injuries, decedent’s estate presented evidence that defendants acted with substantial certainty of causing decedent serious bodily harm in the form of testimony concerning an earlier incident of dumpster failure that had been reported to defendants; the failure of defendants to take action to repair the garbage truck following the previous accident presented a genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment.

Where the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of fewer than 52 weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed; provided, results fair and just to both parties will be thereby obtained. Where, by reason of a shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the casual nature or terms of his employment, it is impractical to compute the average weekly wages as above defined, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks previous to the injury was being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community.But where for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.Wherever allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu of wages are specified part of the wage contract, they shall be deemed a part of his earnings.Where a minor employee, under the age of 18 years, sustains a permanent disability or dies leaving dependents surviving, the compensation payable for permanent disability or death shall be calculated, first, upon the average weekly wage paid to adult employees employed by the same employer at the time of the accident in a similar or like class of work which the injured minor employee would probably have been promoted to if not injured, or, second, upon a wage sufficient to yield the maximum weekly compensation benefit. Compensation for temporary total disability or for the death of a minor without dependents shall be computed upon the average weekly wage at the time of the accident, unless the total disability extends more than 52 weeks, and then the compensation may be increased in proportion to the employee’s expected earnings.In case of disabling injury or death to a volunteer firefighter; volunteer member of an organized rescue squad; an authorized pickup firefighter, as defined in subdivision (2) of this section, when that individual is engaged in emergency fire suppression activities for the North Carolina Forest Service; a duly appointed and sworn member of an auxiliary police department organized pursuant to

        The Workers’ Compensation Act is a compromise
        
        arrived at through the concessions of employees and employers alike. Nothing in it supports the notion that it was enacted just for the protection of careful, prudent employees, or that employees that do not stick strictly to their business are beyond its protection. By its terms, with certain exceptions the act applies to all employees who work for employers with the requisite number of employees and are injured by accident during the course of and arising from their employment; and it is not required that the employment be the sole proximate cause of the injury, it being enough that any reasonable relationship to the employment exists, or employment is a contributory cause.

       <p>
        The social policy behind the Workers’ Compensation Act is twofold.
        
        First, the Act provides employees swift and certain compensation for the loss of earning capacity from accident or occupational disease arising in the course of employment. Second, the Act insures limited liability for employers. Although the Act should be liberally construed to effectuate its intent, the courts cannot judicially expand the employer’s liability beyond the statutory parameters. Hendrix v. Linn-Corriher Corp.,

        Employee timely filed her claim for additional benefits because the employer last provided medical compensation for the employee’s injury when it tendered payment to a medical company; the services the medical company provided constitute “rehabilitative services” because its role as an administrative intermediary was necessary to ensure the employee received the appropriate treatment in order to effect a cure or give relief for her compensable back injury.

        Joint employment
        
        occurs when a single employee under contract with two employers, and under the simultaneous control of both, simultaneously performs services for both employers, and when the service for each employer is the same as, or is closely related to, that for the other. In such a case, both employers are liable for workers’ compensation. Henderson v. Manpower of Guilford County, Inc., 70 N.C. App. 408, 319 S.E.2d 690 (1984). In accord with first paragraph in the main volume. See Anderson v. Texas Gulf, Inc., 83 N.C. App. 634, 351 S.E.2d 109,

        An independent contractor has been defined as one who exercises an independent employment, contracts to do a piece of work according to his own judgment and methods, and without being subject to his employer, except as to the result of the work, and who has the right to employ and direct the action of other workers in the prosecution of the work without interference or right of control on the part of his employer.

        Generally speaking, an independent contractor is one who undertakes to produce a given result, where in the actual execution of the work he is not under the orders or control of the person for whom he does it, and where he may use his own discretion in matters and things not specified. One who represents another only as to the results of a piece of work, and not as to the means of accomplishing it, is an independent contractor and not a servant or employee. Bryson v.

         Elements of Relationship of Employer and Independent Contractor. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The elements which earmark the relationship of employer and independent contractor, are generally as follows: The person employed (a) is engaged in an independent business, calling, or occupation; (b) is to have the independent use of his skill, knowledge, or training in the execution of the work; (c) is doing a specific piece of work at a fixed price, or for a lump sum or upon a quantitative basis; (d) is not subject to discharge because he adopts one method of doing the work rather than another; (e) is not in the regular employ of the other contracting party; (f) is free to use such assistants as he thinks proper; (g) has full control over such assistants; and (h) selects his own time. The presence of no one of these indicia is controlling, nor is the presence of all required. Hayes v. Board of Trustees,

Deceased was paid a stipulated sum per load and was also paid the hourly wage of truck driver employed by defendant for time lost waiting in line when the concrete mixer broke down.

        Where men working on lumbering jobs were injured it was contended that they were not in the employ of defendant but of independent subcontractors with whom the defendant had written agreements. The Commission found that the purported subcontractors were on the defendant’s payroll (one as a superintendent) and that the injured men ate at a camp bearing defendant’s name and received their pay by check direct from defendant; accordingly that the men were employees of, and entitled to compensation from, defendants. The Supreme Court remanded the cause for more specific findings of fact as to the making and performance of the alleged contract with “subcontractors” and as to the relationship of the parties, and for a separate finding of law as to who was the employer of claimants.

        Because of the statutory requirement that the employment be under an “appointment or contract of hire,” the first question which must be answered in determining whether a lent employee has entered into an employment relationship with a special employer for purposes of this Act is: Did he make a contract of hire with the special employer? If this question cannot be answered “yes,” the investigation is closed, and this must necessarily be so, since the employee loses certain rights along with those he gains when he strikes up a new employment relation.

        The test for determining the liability of special employers in loaned employee cases is stated as follows: When a general employer lends an employee to a special employer, the special employer becomes liable for workers’ compensation only if (a) the employee has made a contract of hire, express or implied, with the special employer; (b) the work being done is essentially that of the special employer; and (c) the special employer has a right to control the details of the work. When all three of the above conditions are satisfied in relation to both employers, both employers are liable for workers’ compensation. Henderson v. Manpower of Guilford County, Inc., 70 N.C.

        The Industrial Commission found upon supporting evidence that the deceased employee had been employed by defendant employer for a number of years, that he had been promoted successively from truck driver to stock clerk to salesman with increased wages from time to time, and that he had been given a raise in the last position less than three months prior to the time of injury resulting in death, part of the supporting evidence being testimony by the employee’s superior that “with the business he was getting” he would have had further increases. It was held that the findings were sufficient in law to constitute “exceptional reasons” within the meaning of subdivision (5) of this section, and the employee’s “average weekly wage” was properly fixed at the amount he was earning weekly at the time of the injury, it being patent that the wages he was then receiving were not temporary and uncertain, but constituted a fair basis upon which to compute the award to his dependents.

        In a proceeding for compensation for the death of a college student employed part-time during vacation and after school for a period of 11 weeks in which he worked from 17 1/2 to 51 hours a week, there was no factual basis for application of the method of determining average weekly wages provided in the third sentence of subdivision (5), where there was no evidence as to the average weekly amount being earned during the 52 weeks previous to decedent’s injury by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment, and no evidence as to the average weekly amount a part-time worker in the same employment had earned during the 52 weeks previous to decedent’s injury, while working for the particular employer or any other employer in the same locality or community.

        When an employee suffered a minor physical injury at work, and later suffered a disabling psychological injury in the course of the employer’s investigation of the physical injury because she thought she was being accused of suing her employer, the evidence established that her disability was caused by the mental injury, rather than the physical injury, and she was not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits because the mental injury did not qualify as an accident, for workers’ compensation purposes, because it was not an unlooked for and untoward event involving the interruption of the routine of work and the introduction thereby of unusual conditions likely to result in unexpected consequences.

        Though an injury sustained while playing football may not be an unusual occurrence, such injury is not a probable, intended consequence of the employment and constitutes an unlooked for and untoward event that was not expected or designed; as such, sufficient evidence supported the findings of fact that a plaintiff, a professional football player, sustained a compensable injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment when his testimony explained that there was a technique he used to initiate a block by having his wrist in an upward position but, instead, his hand was forced into an awkward position wherein his wrist went downward and such testimony indicated that although he was engaging in his normal work duty of blocking an offensive lineman, he was injured because he was forced by another player into utilizing an unusual and awkward blocking or work technique that was not normally used in his normal work routine.

        Football player’s leg injury was a compensable injury by accident where the player sustained an injury while playing in the fifteenth game of the season, the injury was unusual in that the player had attempted to block numerous extra point attempts without sustaining a broken leg and torn tendons in his ankle, it was unexpected that one or more players would fall on the back of the injured player’s leg causing a career-ending injury, and for such an injury to occur required a force of 3000 pounds per square inch.

The effect of the amendment was to eliminate the need to show an external cause or unusual conditions in order for a worker to receive compensation for a back injury.

        Where plaintiff injured her back during her previous employment, was treated for back pain over a period of time, and the pain which plaintiff experienced during her employment with defendant was in the same area of her back that had been injured during plaintiff’s prior employment, there was competent evidence to support the Commission’s findings and conclusion that plaintiff’s back condition was neither caused by nor aggravated by an injury, by accident or by specific traumatic incident at her new employment.

        Denial of workers’ compensation benefits was upheld because the employee failed to prove any of the employee’s alleged occupational diseases or injuries resulted from the employee’s employment; among other things, an expert acknowledged that the employee did not have any documented cause for employee’s cervical condition and that the expert’s opinion of causation was mere speculation.

        Finding of the Commission that plaintiff ’s back injury was not accidental, in that the evidence failed to disclose an interruption of plaintiff ’s normal work routine, which involved the regular and repetitive lifting, albeit without usage of his left hand, was supported by the evidence, despite plaintiff ’s argument that because his employer knew of disability certificate given him by his physician following an earlier hand injury but nonetheless assigned him duties which involved lifting heavy objects, the injury occurred as a matter of law outside his normal work routine.

        Deceased was required to report to work before daylight. On the particular morning in question, he was told to return later in the day.

        because the evidence supported the Commission’s finding that there was no unusual or unforeseen circumstance interrupting the employee’s normal work routine when he sustained the injury to his Achilles tendon; the employee’s testimony indicated that he routinely would have to step backward off the flat portion of a crosswalk, that in doing so, he would often step onto the inclined section. that during the incident nothing hit him or tripped him, and that there was nothing wrong with the crosswalk.

        To be compensable under the act an injury must arise out of and be received in the course of employment. Two ideas are involved here.

        In practice, the “course of employment” and “arising out of employment” tests are not, and should not be, applied entirely independently; they are both parts of a single test of work-connection, and therefore deficiencies in the strength of one factor are sometimes allowed to be made up by strengths in the other.

       <p>
        When the primary injury is shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the employment, unless it is the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to claimant’s own intentional conduct. Thus, a subsequent injury, whether an aggravation of the original injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury. Starr v.

         Rule of Causal Relation Enunciated. —

       <p>
        An injury to be compensable must be shown to have resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. This principle has come to be known and referred to as the rule of causal relation, i.e., that injury to be compensable must spring from the employment. This rule of causal relation is the very sheet anchor of the Workers’ Compensation Act. It has kept the act within the limits of its intended scope — that of providing compensation benefits for industrial injuries, rather than branching out into the field of general health insurance benefits.

        For an accident to arise out of the employment there must be some causal connection between the injury and the employment. When an injury cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause, or if it comes from a hazard to which the employee would have been equally exposed apart from the employment, or from the hazard common to others, it does not arise out of the employment. In such a situation the fact that the injury occurred on the employer’s premises is immaterial. Cole v. Guilford County,

        ; where the exact nature and probable genesis of a particular type of injury involves complicated medical questions far removed from the ordinary experience and knowledge of laymen, only an expert can give competent opinion evidence as to the cause of the injury. Sufficient medical evidence supported a determination by the North Carolina Industrial Commission that an employee suffered a work related injury entitling her to temporary total disability compensation where her doctor testified that her third neck injury, one that occurred in the course of her employment, was the injury that caused a ruptured disc, and where medical records and the employee’s testimony supported the medical findings.

        While there must be some causal connection between the employment and the injury, nevertheless it is sufficient if the injury is one which, after the event, may be seen to have had its origin in the employment, and it need not be shown that it is one which should have been foreseen or expected.

        In making the determination whether an injury that occurred off the employer’s premises during a scheduled break is within the scope of employment, there are several factors to consider: (1) the duration of the break period; (2) whether the employee is paid during the break period; (3) whether the employer provides a place for employees to take breaks, including vending facilities; (4) whether the employer permits off-premises breaks, or has acquiesced in such despite policies against such breaks; and (5) the proximity of the off-premises location where the employee was injured to the employment site.

Facts were consistent with an interpretation of Allred that no showing was needed that plaintiff’s injury was made more severe or caused solely by driving a truck, and since the employee was returning to work after making a delivery for his employer when the accident occurred, an increased risk analysis was not relevant.

        Where an injury cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause, or comes from a hazard to which the worker would have been equally exposed apart from the employment or from a hazard common to others, it does not arise out of the employment.

        Whether an accident grew out of the employment is a mixed question of law and fact which the court has the right to review on appeal. If the detailed findings of fact force a conclusion opposite that reached by the Commission, it is the duty of the court to reverse the Commission. Warren v. City of Wilmington, 43 N.C.

        There was sufficient evidence to support the Industrial Commission’s findings of fact and conclusions of law that the medical treatment of an employee’s right shoulder was causally related to her compensable right shoulder injury because doctors’ testimony supported the presumption that additional medical treatment was directly related to the compensable right shoulder injury; the employer failed to present evidence to disprove the causal connection.

        Where, as a matter of goodwill, an employer at his own expense provides an occasion for recreation or an outing for his employees and invites them to participate, but does not require them to do so, and an employee is injured while engaged in the activities incident thereto, such injury does not arise out of the employment.

        In determining whether employee injuries incurred at employer-sponsored recreational and social activities arise out of and in the course of the employment, several questions should be considered: (1) Did the employer in fact sponsor the event? (2) To what extent was attendance really voluntary? (3) Was there some degree of encouragement to attend evidenced by such factors as: (a) taking a record of attendance; (b) paying for the time spent; (c) requiring the employee to work if he did not attend; or (d) maintaining a known custom of attending? (4) Did the employer finance the occasion to a substantial extent? (5) Did the employees regard the activity as an employment benefit to which they were entitled as of right? (6) Did the employer benefit from the event, not merely in a vague way through better morale and good will, but through such tangible advantages as having an opportunity to make speeches and awards?

        Plaintiff was not entitled to compensation for a broken ankle suffered while playing volleyball at an annual picnic for faculty members in the radiology department in defendant school, where it was not clear that the radiology department in fact sponsored the picnic; attendance at the picnic was voluntary; no record of attendance was taken; participants were not paid for the time spent at the picnic, nor was any employee required to work at the medical school if he did not attend; the picnic, while certainly an annual custom, was not an event that employee regarded as being a benefit to which he was entitled as a matter of right, and the radiology department did not utilize the picnic as an opportunity to give a “pep” talk or grant awards.

        When a person owns an airplane which he maintains and keeps for his personal use as well as for use when traveling for his employer, he is not protected by workers’ compensation while he is doing something to maintain the airplane and not doing anything else to promote the employer’s business. The Workers’ Compensation Act was not intended to cover accidents which occur while an employee is repairing his own property which he uses for himself and for his employer. Pollock v.

It was held that the courtesies and assistance extended by the employee were in reciprocity for the courtesy of free air requested by the employee for the employer’s benefit, so that the employee had reasonable ground to apprehend that refusal to render the assistance requested of him might well have resulted in like refusal of the courtesy requested by him, and therefore the findings supported the conclusion that the accident arose out of and in the course of employment.

The evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the Industrial Commission that death resulted from an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment, the general rule of nonliability for an accident occurring while an employee is being transported to or from work in a conveyance of a third person over which the employer has no control not being applicable upon the evidence.

        Where men are working together at the same work, disagreements may be expected to arise about the work, the manner of doing it, the use of tools, interference with one another, and many other details which may be trifling or important. Infirmity of temper, or worse, may be expected, and occasionally blows and fighting.

        Disobedience of a direct and specific order by a then present superior breaks the causal relation between the employment and the resulting injury. Conversely, when there is a rule or a prior order and the employee is faced with the choice of remaining idle in compliance with the rule or order or continuing to further his employer’s business in contravention of it, no superior being present, the employer who would reap the benefits of the employee’s acts if successfully completed should bear the burden of injury resulting from such acts. Under such circumstances, engaging in an activity which is outside the narrow confines of the employee’s job description, but which is reasonably related to the accomplishment of the task for which the employee was hired, does not ordinarily constitute a departure from the scope of employment.

The facts did not compel the conclusion, as a matter of law, that at the time of injury the employee had not deviated from or abandoned his employment, and therefore the award of the Industrial Commission denying compensation was upheld.

        The evidence tended to show that claimant, in the performance of his duty to go to a guard tower outside of a high wire fence, elected to climb over the fence rather than go around by the gate, which would require approximately 200 yards of travel, and was injured when he jumped from the top of the fence to avoid falling therefrom. It was held that the evidence sustained the award of compensation, and the contention that claimant climbed the fence for his own convenience rather than as a part of his duties was untenable, since the mere fact that an employee selected the more hazardous route in the performance of his duties does not defeat recovery.

        When an employee afflicted with a preexisting disease or infirmity suffers a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and such injury materially accelerates or aggravates the preexisting disease or infirmity and thus proximately contributes to the death or disability of the employee, the injury is compensable even if it would not have caused death or disability to a normal person.

       <p>
        Plaintiff ’s compensable spinal injury which caused permanent paralysis of his legs was a proximate cause of burns received by plaintiff on the lower portions of his body when a cigarette he had been smoking set the clothing on his bed on fire. Plaintiff suffered the burns because of a loss of feeling and sensitivity in the lower portions of his body as a result of the original compensable accident, and the act of leaving the cigarette where it could set fire to the bedclothing was insufficient to break the chain of causation between the original injury and the burns sustained.

        When a preexisting, nondisabling, non-job-related condition is aggravated or accelerated by an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment or by an occupational disease so that disability results, then the employer must compensate the employee for the entire resulting disability, even though it would not have disabled a normal person to that extent.

        A policeman 56 years of age, who was in good health and without any physical defect or disease, arrested a young man, who, because of intoxication, violently and viciously resisted, and after the officer subdued him and transported him to the jail, the officer and another had to carry the prisoner up three flights of stairs because the elevator was out of order. The officer collapsed with acute dilatation of the heart due to the unusual exertion. This injury to the heart muscle was chronic and progressive and the policeman suffered a fatal heart attack some 10 months thereafter. It was held that the evidence warranted the conclusion that the injury to the heart resulted not from inherent weakness or disease but from an unusual and unexpected happening, and that therefore death resulted from an accident within the meaning of this section.

There was expert testimony to the effect that the exposure was a contributing factor causing acute nephritis resulting in death, and that the accident and exposure accelerated the employee’s death.

        The medical condition known as “hernia” is not specifically defined in either the Worker’s Compensation Act or in the case law. Although the Court of Appeals has declined to define the term hernia, it has noted that the legislature’s use of the term hernia in conjunction with the word rupture in the statute, “hernia or rupture,” seems to indicate that something less than full extension through the organ wall is contemplated.

        Plaintiff was a plumbing foreman. He had been instructed to lay off his workmen and to finish a job with one other employee. In helping the other employee lift a heavy pipe, he felt a pain in his abdomen. He consulted a physician who found an enlargement of the left inguinal ring and a bulge but no protrusion. The doctor strapped plaintiff and gave him a truss. Eighteen days later an actual hernia was found. An award granting compensation for hernia was affirmed, the court saying that the accident consisted of the plaintiff ’s having to do unusual work and that the lesion and enlargement of the inguinal ring, from which the fully developed hernia naturally comes, did result immediately.

On this occasion he felt a sharp abdominal pain as he lifted and “he got sick,” but after a short rest, he worked till noon, when he reported that he had strained his side and went home. Hernia appeared a few days later. The employer contended that the injury was not caused by accident but only by the doing of regular work in the regular way.

        (1) where the injury is clearly attributable to an idiopathic condition of the employee, with no other factors intervening or operating to cause or contribute to the injury, no award should be made; (2) where the injury is associated with any risk attributable to the employment, compensation should be allowed, even though the employee may have suffered from an idiopathic condition which precipitated or contributed to the injury.

        It has been held that a fall is an accident, and where it is not shown to have resulted from the employee’s physical infirmity or from external force unconnected with the employment, it may be found by the Commission to arise out of the employment. No affirmative evidence as to what caused the fall is necessary to support the finding. Here the employee, reaching up to a rack in the course of her work, lost her balance and fell. Robbins v.

       <p>
        The evidence tended to show that plaintiff employee was subject to epileptic fits, that while driving the employer’s truck in the course of his employment he felt a seizure approaching, stopped the truck on the side of the road, opened the door and lay down on the seat of the truck with his head on the seat opposite the steering wheel and his feet hanging out of the truck, that he immediately suffered an epileptic seizure causing him to lose consciousness, and that when he “came to” his body was on the outside of the truck and his hands on the steering wheel. The expert medical testimony was to the effect that the employee had suffered broken bones caused by the fall from the seat of the truck and that the fall resulted from the epileptic seizure. It was held that the evidence disclosed that the sole cause of the employee’s moving from a position of safety to his injury was the epileptic seizure, and therefore the fall was independent of, unrelated to, and apart from the employment, and the evidence could not support a finding of the Industrial Commission that the injury resulted from an accident arising out of the employment.

        Where a cemetery caretaker employed by the city, who had no telephone, regularly and daily made rounds of the funeral homes at night to determine what graves needed to be dug the next day, injury sustained by him when he was hit by an automobile while engaged in making these rounds was compensable. The employer was said to have consented to the making of the trip because of the established custom of the caretaker. Williams v. Brunswick County Bd. of Educ., 1 N.C. App. 89, 160 S.E.2d 102,

        In an action to recover death benefits for the death of a school teacher which occurred when she backed her car, at the end of the school day, into the path of a truck, evidence and findings that the deceased was required as part of her duties to visit students in their homes after school hours, and that she was also required from time to time to purchase incidental supplies at retail stores for use in her class, along with related evidence and findings, presented nothing more than a scenario of what the deceased might do on a given day, and was not sufficient to support a finding that the deceased was performing one of the duties of her employment at the time of the accident.

The Commission was of the opinion that death resulted from accident arising out of and in the course of employment either as deputy sheriff or as jailer or as “deputy-sheriff jailer.” The statute did not then treat deputies as employees of the county and the Supreme Court remanded the case for a finding specifically on whether the accident was in the course of deceased’s employment as jailer.

        In order to prove disability
        
        the burden is on the employee to show that he is unable to earn the same wages he had earned before the injury, either in the same employment or in other employment. The employee may meet this burden in one of four ways: (1) the production of medical evidence that he is physically or mentally, as a consequence of the work related injury, incapable of work in any employment; (2) the production of evidence that he is capable of some work, but that he has, after a reasonable effort on his part, been unsuccessful in his effort to obtain employment; (3) the production of evidence that he is capable of some work but that it would be futile because of preexisting conditions. i.e. age, inexperience, lack of education, to seek other employment; or (4) the production of evidence that he has obtained other employment at a wage less than that earned prior to the injury.

        But there is no “disability” if the employee is receiving the same wages in the same or any other employment.
        
        The fact that “in the same” employment he is not required to perform all the physical work theretofore required of him can make no difference. Even so, if this is not “the same employment,” then it clearly comes within the term “other employment.” To remove the employment from one classification necessarily shifts it to the other. Furthermore, there is no language used in this section or in any other part of the statute which even suggests that “other employment” must be with a different employer. Branham v.

        While it was correct that plaintiff ’s inability to earn the same wages as in her former employment was not due to a physical incapacity per se, the transfer of positions which resulted in a diminished earning capacity was necessitated by a compensable injury; therefore, plaintiff ’s inability to earn the same wages in other jobs was due to her occupational disease and not merely to her lack of skill in the job as the Industrial Commission found, and the commission’s conclusion of law that plaintiff was not entitled to benefits for partial disability because she was capable of earning the same wages she earned before contracting the occupational disease, was not supported by the findings of fact.

Before defendants could be required to prove the availability of suitable employment, plaintiff had to first come forward with evidence to show that his earning capacity was diminished as a result of his on-the-job injury.

        Where the evidence tended to show that plaintiff was permanently partially disabled by reason of occupational disease and that after failing to obtain employment in the cotton textile industry in which he had been employed for 29 years, the plaintiff made an earnest and highly commendable search for other employment, and was able to obtain a permanent job with a restaurant at the minimum wage but was released from that employment only because business conditions resulted in the restaurant going out of business, the Commission was required to enter an award setting the plaintiff ’s compensation at two-thirds of the difference between his average wage of $196.91 a week while working for the defendant and the minimum wage of $134.00 a week which he received thereafter, an award of $41.94 per week, not to exceed 300 weeks.

But though the wage payments were hers, offsetting them against compensation awarded her for the same weeks is authorized for two reasons: First, no compensation is due claimant for the weeks that her wages were paid because disability under the Workers’ Compensation Act is based upon decreased earnings, and she had sustained no wage loss; and second, the claimant cannot collect workers’ compensation for the weeks that her wages were paid because of the policy against employees receiving duplicating payments at the employers’ expense.

        The word “acknowledged,” referring to illegitimate children under this section, is not a term of art requiring a formal declaration before an authorized official; in regard to paternity actions, the term “acknowledgment” generally has been held to mean the recognition of a parental relation, either by written agreement, verbal declarations or statements, by the life, acts, and conduct of the parties, or any other satisfactory evidence that the relation was recognized and admitted.

         “Justifiable Cause” for Living Separate and Apart. —

       <p>
        A husband and wife are not living separate and apart for “justifiable cause” if they are living separate and apart as a result of a mutual agreement evidenced by a legally executed separation agreement. Bass v. Mooresville Mills, 11 N.C. App. 631, 182 S.E.2d 246,
        <cite class="nc_code">

        (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a separation agreement is in full force and effect at the time of the employee’s death, the employee and his wife are, as a matter of law, living separate and apart by mutual consent, which is not “justifiable cause” within the meaning of this section. Bass v. Mooresville Mills, 11 N.C. App. 631, 182 S.E.2d 246,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         1971 N.C. App. LEXIS 1601
        </cite>
        (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        While “justifiable cause” is usually equated to some form of marital misconduct, it would also seem to be applicable where the separation is not intended by the parties to be permanent, the temporary living apart being merely for reasons of convenience. Bass v. Mooresville Mills, 11 N.C. App. 631, 182 S.E.2d 246,
        <cite class="nc_code">
         1971 N.C. App. LEXIS 1601
        </cite>
        (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is authority in other jurisdictions to the effect that “justifiable cause,” as that term is employed in statutory provisions similar to subdivision (14) of this section, may not be interpreted as applicable to separations by mutual consent. Bass v. Mooresville Mills, 11 N.C. App. 631, 182 S.E.2d 246,
        <cite class="nc_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        There is no specific formula for the definition of “justifiable cause” under the statute. A court must consider the complexity and history of the particular relationship in order to determine whether the marital partners were separated for justifiable cause in the months before the death of a recipient of benefits.

       In the absence of evidence that the employee or the employer had given notice of nonacceptance of the act, it must be presumed that both employee and employer are bound by the provisions of the act. However, where an employee was injured by the negligence of a third-party tort-feasor and filed no claim for compensation against the employer but instead instituted a common-law action against the third party, it was held that since the employee filed no claim against his employer under the act, he waived his rights thereunder and could proceed directly against the third party, and the provisions of the act provided no defense against such suit to the third party.

Further, dollar-for-dollar credits were precluded by North Carolina law as a payment that the player received for the last game of the season that he missed was made by the player’s union under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement could not relieve the employer, in whole or in part, from its obligation to pay the player workers’ compensation.

       The phrase, “those conducting his business,” which appears in this section, should be given a liberal construction. One must be deemed to be conducting his employer’s business, within the meaning of this section, whenever he, himself, is acting within the course of his employment, as that term is used in the act. It is not necessary, in order to bring an employee within the protection of this statute, to show that his act was such as would have been imputed to the employer at common law. Altman v. Sanders,

       A rationale supporting coemployee immunity
       
       is that immunity from common-law suit for ordinary negligence is part of that which an employee receives for forfeiting his own right to bring a negligence action. Furthermore, since negligence connotes unconscious inadvertence, allowing injured workers to sue coemployees would not reduce injuries caused by ordinary negligence. The same cannot be said in cases involving intentional torts. Pleasant v. Johnson,

       Where the employer furnished a parking lot for his employees and plaintiff employee, after parking her car and while walking to the plant to report for work, was struck by a vehicle operated by another employee who was then backing into a parking space preparatory to reporting for work, the accident arose in the course of the employment, precluding an action at common law by either employee against the other.

        Wife’s Immunity Not Extended to Husband. —

       By reason of the fact that an employee was within the course of her employment at the time of the alleged injury to the plaintiff, this section threw about her a cloak of immunity from suit on account of such injury even if it was caused by her negligence in the operation of automobile. This section did not, however, extend this immunity to her husband, if it was established that she was driving the automobile as his agent and within the course of such employment. Altman v. Sanders,

       Where a judgment in favor of a defendant, the employee or agent of her husband, did not rest upon the ground that she was not negligent, but rested upon the ground that this section made her personally immune from suit on account of her negligence because, at the time of her negligent act or omission, she was in the course of her employment by a company, it was error to dismiss the action as against her husband since this statutory immunity had no connection with her employment by her husband to drive his automobile. He was acting, through her, in the driving of the automobile, if she was operating it with his consent and pursuant to the family purpose for which he maintained the automobile. It was as if he were personally present driving the vehicle in the same manner. Obviously, if he had brought his wife to her work, and had driven as she was alleged to have done, the act would not have made him immune to suit by the plaintiff, for he was not conducting the company’s business. He was equally subject to suit when, by the fiction of the law, he so drove by and through his wife as his agent. Though she, his agent or employee, was immune to suit by the plaintiff, he was not.

       When deciding whether an employer acted with “substantial certainty” of the consequences of its conduct, factors to consider may include: whether the risk existed in the workplace for a long time without causing substantial injury; whether the risk was created by a defective instrumentality with a high probability of causing the harm; whether there was evidence the employer, prior to the accident, attempted to remedy the risk that caused the harm; whether the employer’s conduct that created the risk violated state or federal work safety regulations; whether the employer created a risk by failing to adhere to an industry practice, even though there was no violation of a state or federal safety regulation; and whether the employer offered safety training in the context of the risk causing the harm.

       A rationale supporting coemployee immunity
       
       is that immunity from common-law suit for ordinary negligence is part of that which an employee receives for forfeiting his own right to bring a negligence action. Furthermore, since negligence connotes unconscious inadvertence, allowing injured workers to sue coemployees would not reduce injuries caused by ordinary negligence. The same cannot be said in cases involving intentional torts. Pleasant v. Johnson,
       <cite class="nc_code">
        312 N.C. 710

       But the Workers’ Compensation Act does not insulate a coemployee from his willful, wanton and reckless negligence.

       When an employee’s injury is covered by the Workers’ Compensation Act, the right to bring an independent negligence action against the employer is barred by the existence of the workers’ compensation remedy. Since the Act’s coverage extends to injuries resulting from an employer’s willful, wanton and reckless negligence, there was no issue regarding an election of remedies in this action. Stack v.

       As an employer’s willful and wanton negligence in handling a former employee’s harassment complaint was an “accident” (an unlooked for and untoward event), and as her injury arose out of and was sustained in the course of her employment, her negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against the employer was barred by workers’ compensation exclusivity.

       Since the Workers’ Compensation Act by its terms repeals all inconsistent legislation, the rights and remedies thereby given are substituted for those theretofore provided by the Death Act.

       When, in a wrongful death case, a court dismissed a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction brought months after entry of a default judgment against an employer, dismissing the challenge asserting workers’ compensation exclusivity deprived the court of jurisdiction, on equitable estoppel and laches grounds, the court erred because: (1) the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction could be contested at any time; (2) subject-matter jurisdiction was independent of the parties’ conduct, making equitable estoppel and laches inapplicable; (3) the court made no required findings and conclusions regarding jurisdiction after the employer legitimately challenged the court’s jurisdiction; and (4) the two-year workers’ compensation claim filing requirement did not necessarily bar any untimely claim as the employer’s fault caused the delay.

       Employer’s appeal of a denial of its motion for summary judgment in a wrongful death suit was properly before the appellate court;
       
       the summary judgment motion argued that the employer was immune from the suit, and, although the appeal was interlocutory, appellate review was necessary on the grounds that the North Carolina’s Workers’ Compensation Act granted employers who complied with the Act immunity from suit, which would have been lost if the case was permitted to go to trial.

Such issue shall be the last of the issues submitted to the jury. If the verdict shall be that actionable negligence of the employer did join and concur with that of the third party in producing the injury or death, then the court shall reduce the damages awarded by the jury against the third party by the amount which the employer would otherwise be entitled to receive therefrom by way of subrogation hereunder and the entire amount recovered, after such reduction, shall belong to the employee or his personal representative free of any claim by the employer and the third party shall have no further right by way of contribution or otherwise against the employer, except any right which may exist by reason of an express contract of indemnity between the employer and the third party, which was entered into prior to the injury to the employee.

        Trial court did not err by concluding that pursuant to G.S. 97-10.2(e) a steamroller driver’s employer was not entitled to recover on its workers’ compensation lien from a judgment awarded to the driver following a collision. G.S. 97-10.2(e) evidenced a strong public policy of prohibiting a negligent employer from recouping any workers’ compensation benefits paid to an injured employee, and the General Assembly intended for G.S. 97-10.2(e) to apply even in cases where the issue of last clear chance had been submitted to the jury and the jury had answered this question in the affirmative.

Virginia law which violated this policy was not applied even though injury occurred in Virginia. Braxton v. Anco Elec., Inc., 100 N.C. App. 635, 397 S.E.2d 640,

        Where plaintiff sought and received workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act for an injury received in Virginia and caused by a third-party subcontractor, and, inter alia, North Carolina was the place of plaintiff ’s residence, the location of defendant’s business, and the place of the initial hiring, North Carolina had significant interests in applying its own law based on the employment relationship and its connection with North Carolina.

        Where all the parties were North Carolina citizens; the plaintiff’s contract of employment and the contracts giving rise to the workers’ compensation coverage were signed in North Carolina; and the plaintiff was receiving benefits under our workers’ compensation statute, North Carolina’s interests in implementing the protections afforded by its statute were paramount. An employee’s temporary presence in Virginia so as to carry out his employment contract did not strip him of the rights he otherwise enjoyed under the North Carolina workers’ compensation statute with regard to the breadth of North Carolina’s exclusive remedy bar on common law actions in tort.

        Plaintiff’s request to reduce or eliminate defendants’ workers’ compensation lien on funds plaintiff received from South Carolina underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage was properly denied because plaintiff sought reduction or elimination of the subrogation lien pursuant to G.S. 97-10.2(j), which was remedial in nature and remedial rights were determined by the law of the forum; although South Carolina law, S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-160, would not have allowed a lien on such funds, North Carolina law applied, and North Carolina did not have a statute which prevented subrogation of UIM funds. Anglin v.

        It was not an abuse of discretion for a trial court to reduce an employer’s lien against an employee’s settlement with a third-party tortfeasor to zero because (1) the court did not have to first determine that the settlement was insufficient to compensate the employer for workers’ compensation benefits the employer paid before the court could exercise the court’s discretion to determine the amount of the employer’s lien, and (2) the evidence allowed the court to find that the settlement and the workers’ compensation benefits did not fully compensate the employee for the employee’s pain, suffering, and other losses.

        Since it relieves the employer of liability to his injured employee as a tortfeasor, the Workers’ Compensation Act abrogates both the statutory right of a negligent third party to claim contribution from a negligent employer in equal fault, and the common-law right of a passively negligent third party to demand indemnity from an actively negligent employer. And this construction of the act is not invalidated by the mere circumstance that such construction may occasion hardship or injustice to a passively negligent third party. Hunsucker v.

        Town and a state agency had standing to bring a subrogation complaint against a Chapter 13 debtor to recover workers’ compensation benefits paid to an individual injured in a pre-petition automobile accident with the debtor under G.S. 97-10.2(c) because the individual did not bring a timely claim against the debtor after the accident.

        Trial court did not err in concluding that an insurance carrier did not have standing to bring an action to recover workers’ compensation benefits paid to an employee and dismissing the action; based upon the plain language of the statute and the legislative history, nothing shows the General Assembly intended to provide the insurance carrier with the right to bring a direct action against a third party.

        Based upon the plain language of the statute, an insurance carrier does not have the right to bring an action against a third party in its own name, if the employee refuses to cooperate; the language of the statute explicitly states “the employer shall have the right to proceed to enforce the liability of the third party,” and the insurance carrier is only mentioned once in the sections outlining the procedure for bringing an action against a third party.

        In the event of a verdict for the plaintiff in the action against third party, the trial court, sitting without a jury, is to determine the amount of compensation paid or payable to the injured employee under the act on the basis either of a stipulation of the interested persons or of evidence submitted to it, and after so doing is to enter a judgment safeguarding the rights of any person entitled to share in the recovery, regardless of whether or not such person is a party to the action.

        This section is an integral part of the Workers’ Compensation Act and evidences the legislature’s intention to relieve an employer of the obligation to pay compensation to an employee when the accident giving rise to the employee’s injuries is proximately caused by his intoxication. The oft-quoted rule that the act should be liberally construed does not license either commission or the courts to disregard the manifest intention of the legislature in enacting this section.

        Once an employer proves employee’s use of a non-prescribed controlled substance, it is presumed that the employee was impaired; once the employer presents competent evidence that the impairment was a proximate cause of the accident, the burden shifts to the employee to rebut the presumption of impairment or to show that the impairment was not a contributing proximate cause of the accident.

        This section was designed to be an exception to the general rule that the employee would receive compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. To utilize a “sole” proximate cause standard would virtually vitiate the statute and defeat the express will of the General Assembly. Whenever an employee intends to injure another, that employee will usually not be injured unless the intended victim retaliates. The actions of the intended victim could always be considered a cause of the claimant’s injuries, and therefore the willful intention of the claimant would rarely if ever be the sole cause. Rorie v.

        Ordinarily, an employer with less than five employees is exempt from the act. However, when such employer at his election voluntarily purchases workers’ compensation insurance, he accepts all provisions of the act. In such case, the policy he purchases both creates and protects his compensation liability; and thereafter such employer and his employees are bound by the provisions of the act unless, prior to any accident resulting in injury or death, notice to the contrary is given.

       Mutual mistake justifies voiding a settlement since such settlements are guided by contract principles, but the mistake must be material; the Industrial Commission properly set aside a settlement agreement where it found, by competent evidence, that: (1) the parties entered into the agreement on the mutual mistake of a doctor’s faulty diagnosis that the employee had reached his maximum medical improvement, and (2) the parties materially relied on that faulty diagnosis when they entered the contract; the Commission could enter a new award after vacating the settlement.

       When the employer or insurer admits the employee’s right to compensation, the first installment of compensation payable by the employer shall become due on the fourteenth day after the employer has written or actual notice of the injury or death, on which date all compensation then due shall be paid. Compensation thereafter shall be paid in installments weekly except where the Commission determines that payment in installments should be made monthly or at some other period. Upon paying the first installment of compensation and upon suspending, reinstating, changing, or modifying such compensation for any cause, the insurer shall immediately notify the Commission, on a form prescribed by the Commission, that compensation has begun, or has been suspended, reinstated, changed, or modified.

       In any claim for compensation in which the employer or insurer is uncertain on reasonable grounds whether the claim is compensable or whether it has liability for the claim under this Article, the employer or insurer may initiate compensation payments without prejudice and without admitting liability. The initial payment shall be accompanied by a form prescribed by and filed with the Commission, stating that the payments are being made without prejudice. Payments made pursuant to this subsection may continue until the employer or insurer contests or accepts liability for the claim or 90 days from the date the employer has written or actual notice of the injury or death, whichever occurs first, unless an extension is granted pursuant to this section. Prior to the expiration of the 90-day period, the employer or insurer may upon reasonable grounds apply to the Commission for an extension of not more than 30 days. The initiation of payment does not affect the right of the employer or insurer to continue to investigate or deny the compensability of the claim or its liability therefor during this period. If at any time during the 90-day period or extension thereof, the employer or insurer contests the compensability of the claim or its liability therefor, it may suspend payment of compensation and shall promptly notify the Commission and the employee on a form prescribed by the Commission. The employer or insurer must provide on the prescribed form a detailed statement of its grounds for denying compensability of the claim or its liability therefor. If the employer or insurer does not contest the compensability of the claim or its liability therefor within 90 days from the date it first has written or actual notice of the injury or death, or within such additional period as may be granted by the Commission, it waives the right to contest the compensability of and its liability for the claim under this Article. However, the employer or insurer may contest the compensability of or its liability for the claim after the 90-day period or extension thereof when it can show that material evidence was discovered after that period that could not have been reasonably discovered earlier, in which event the employer or insurer may terminate or suspend compensation subject to the provisions of

       In a workers’ compensation case, an employer’s discovery violation provided a legal basis for attorneys’ fees; however, a remand was necessary because the North Carolina Industrial Commission improperly relied upon two grounds in imposing the award. A payment without prejudice provision and its corresponding 90-day response requirement did not apply to a medical benefits-only claim, pursuant to the instructions in a government-issued form, and the claimant did not assert a notice defense.

       Medical issues can be complex and the extent of an employee’s injuries may be difficult to determine at the time of the accident; however, the legislature has wisely given employers who are uncertain about the compensability of an employee’s injuries the methods to investigate such injuries without admitting any liability under the Workers’ Compensation Act while still providing prompt payments to injured employees.

       The manifest purpose of this section, enacted as an amendment to the original act, is to protect employees of irresponsible and uninsured subcontractors by imposing ultimate liability on principal contractors, intermediate contractors, or subcontractors, who, presumably being financially responsible, have it within their power, in choosing subcontractors, to pass upon their financial responsibility and insist upon appropriate compensation protection for their workers. It is also the obvious aim of the statute to forestall evasion of the act by those who might be tempted to subdivide their regular operations with the workers, thus relegating them for compensation protection to small subcontractors, who fail to carry, or if small enough may not even be required to carry, compensation insurance.

       Whether a plaintiff was injured by accident and had a reasonable excuse for not giving the employer timely notice were factual issues that depended entirely upon her credibility. Since the Commission found, as its prerogative as fact finder permitted, that plaintiff’s testimony was not credible, that determination was binding upon the Court of Appeals. Elliot v. A.O.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Industrial Commission has a special or limited jurisdiction created by statute, and is confined to its terms. Viewed as a court, it is one of limited jurisdiction, and it is a universal rule of law that parties cannot, by consent, give a court, as such, jurisdiction over subject matter of which it would otherwise not have jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in this sense cannot be obtained by consent of the parties, waiver, or estoppel. Barham v. Kayser-Roth Hosiery Co., 15 N.C. App. 519, 190 S.E.2d 306 (1972).

       The plaintiff ’s inchoate right to compensation arose by operation of law on the date of the accident. But his substantive right to compensation was not fixed by the simple fact of injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. The requirement of filing a claim within the time limited by this section was a condition precedent to his right to compensation. Necessarily, then, the element of filing a claim within the time limited was of the very essence of the plaintiff ’s right to recover compensation. McCrater v. Stone &amp; Webster Eng'g Corp.,

       Where there was no evidence that the Industrial Commission acquired jurisdiction either by the timely filing of a claim or by the submission of a voluntary settlement agreement to the Commission for approval, the Industrial Commission properly dismissed plaintiff ’s claim for lack of jurisdiction. Barham v. Kayser-Roth Hosiery Co., 15 N.C. App. 519, 190 S.E.2d 306,

       Timely filing of a claim for compensation is a condition precedent to the right to compensation. Under this construction, failure to file a claim in a timely fashion works a jurisdictional bar to the right to receive compensation.

       Where claimant suffered a general partial disability, but continued to receive the same wages, which amounted to more than the assessable amount of compensation for his injury, he could not receive additional compensation. To protect the employee against the possibility that the employer might, after the expiration of the period of limitation, discontinue the employment and thus defeat the rights of the employee, the Commission, after finding the existence of the disability, directed that an award issue subject to specified limitations. It directed compensation at the statutory rate “at any time it is shown that the claimant is earning less,” etc., during the statutory period of 300 weeks. By this order the Commission, in effect, retained jurisdiction for future adjustments. In so doing it did not exceed its authority. Branham v. Denny Roll &amp; Panel Co.,

       Upon the written request of the employee to the employer, the employer may agree to authorize and pay for a second opinion examination with a duly qualified physician licensed to practice in North Carolina, or licensed in another state if agreed to by the parties or ordered by the Commission. If, within 14 calendar days of the receipt of the written request, the request is denied or the parties, in good faith, are unable to agree upon a health care provider to perform a second opinion examination, the employee may request that the Industrial Commission order a second opinion examination. The expense thereof shall be borne by the employer upon the same terms and conditions as provided in this section for medical compensation.

       Provided, however, if the employee so desires, an injured employee may select a health care provider of the employee’s own choosing to attend, prescribe, and assume the care and charge of the employee’s case subject to the approval of the Industrial Commission. In addition, in case of a controversy arising between the employer and the employee, the Industrial Commission may order necessary treatment. In order for the Commission to grant an employee’s request to change treatment or health care provider, the employee must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the change is reasonably necessary to effect a cure, provide relief, or lessen the period of disability. When deciding whether to grant an employee’s request to change treatment or health care provider, the Commission may disregard or give less weight to the opinion of a health care provider from whom the employee sought evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment before the employee first requested authorization in writing from the employer, insurer, or Commission.

        North Carolina Industrial Commission erred by failing to apply to plaintiff’s request for additional medical treatment and compensation for his complaints of anxiety and depression the presumption that additional medical treatment was directly related to the compensable injury once plaintiff met the initial burden of demonstrating that the injury suffered was causally related to the work-related accident; the Commission instead kept the burden on plaintiff to demonstrate causation despite defendant’s prior admission of compensability, and doing so was a misapplication of the law.

       North Carolina Industrial Commission (Commission) found that no medical evidence existed that showed that the employee either required any additional medical treatment after the date of maximum medical improvement (MMI) or that the employee suffered any permanent injury; since the evidence indicated that the employee had reached MMI, there could be no medical treatment that would lessen the period of the employee’s disability, effect a cure or otherwise give the employee relief. Therefore, the Commission correctly concluded that the employee did not need and was not entitled to any additional medical treatment under

Moreover, defendants could not have imposed a preauthorization requirement as they denied liability for the claimant’s treatment on the grounds that there was no causal connection between that compensable injury and the medical treatment at issue.

        Refusal to Cooperate With Vocational Rehabilitation Not Justified. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission erred in concluding that an employee’s failure to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation services was justified because an employer’s vocational rehabilitation efforts to allow the employee to return to the work force had to be made under the supervision of the employee’s authorized treating physician, but the employee refused to seek treatment from the physician who had been authorized by the Commission to provide treatment to the employee; there was no evidence that the employer’s counsel made any admissions before the Commission with regard to vocational rehabilitation services that could or could not have been offered to the employee, and because the employee was not under the care of an authorized physician, and there was no authorized treating physician to oversee his vocational rehabilitation, the employer could not have offered vocational rehabilitation services to the employee.

The Commission may also consider any and all reimbursement methodologies, including, but not limited to, the use of current procedural terminology (“CPT”) codes, diagnostic-related groupings (“DRGs”), per diem rates, capitated payments, and resource-based relative-value system (“RBRVS”) payments. The Commission may consider statewide fee averages, geographical and community variations in provider costs, and any other factors affecting provider costs.

In any instance in which neither the fee schedule nor a contractual fee applies, the maximum reimbursement to which a provider under subsection (a) is entitled under this Article is the usual, customary, and reasonable charge for the service or treatment rendered.

If an insurer or managed care organization disputes a portion of a health care provider’s bill, it shall pay the uncontested portion of the bill and shall resolve disputes regarding the balance of the charges in accordance with this Article or its contractual arrangement.

       When liability for the medical care of an employee who has suffered an accident is voluntarily incurred by the employer, the bills therefor must be approved by the Commission before the employer can demand reimbursement from its insurance carrier. In this manner, such expenditures are kept within the schedule of fees and charges adopted by the Commission. Biddix v. Rex Mills, Inc.,

        Ambulatory Surgical Centers Included In Definition of Hospital. —

       Superior court improperly concluded that hospitals were separate and legally distinct entities from ambulatory surgical centers because it erred in referring to the statute to define “hospital” as it was used in 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 410, § 33.(a), which regarded a fee schedule adopted by the Industrial Commission; the inclusion of ambulatory surgical centers in the definition of hospital, subjecting them to the Medicare methodology for hospital fee schedules, did not frustrate § 33.(a).

       Medical issues can be complex and the extent of an employee’s injuries may be difficult to determine at the time of the accident; however, the legislature has wisely given employers who are uncertain about the compensability of an employee’s injuries the methods to investigate such injuries without admitting any liability under the Workers’ Compensation Act while still providing prompt payments to injured employees.

        , an employee may receive compensation once the employee has established a total or partial loss of wage-earning capacity, and the employee may receive such compensation for as long as the loss of wage-earning capacity continues, for a maximum of 300 weeks in cases of partial loss of wage-earning capacity. Hence, the primary significance of the concept of Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) is to delineate a crucial point in time only within the context of a claim for scheduled benefits under G.S. 97-31; the concept of MMI does not have any direct bearing upon an employee’s right to continue to receive temporary disability benefits once the employee has established a loss of wage-earning capacity pursuant to G.S. 97-29 or G.S. 97-30.

The employee may meet this burden in one of four ways: (1) the production of medical evidence that he is physically or mentally, as a consequence of the work related injury, incapable of work in any employment; (2) the production of evidence that he is capable of some work, but that he has, after a reasonable effort on his part, been unsuccessful in his effort to obtain employment; (3) the production of evidence that he is capable of some work but that it would be futile because of preexisting conditions, i.e., age, inexperience, lack of education, to seek other employment; or (4) the production of evidence that he has obtained other employment at a wage less than that earned prior to the injury.

        It was not until 1975, when the General Assembly enacted the amendments to this section, that employees suffering from byssinosis were able to receive unlimited weekly benefits for their total and permanent disability. Prior to that time, this section only provided lifetime weekly benefits for persons disabled due to paralysis resulting from injury to the brain or spinal cord or from loss of mental capacity due to injury to the brain. In all other cases of total disability, compensation was restricted in the amount of money paid per week, in the amount of weeks paid and in the maximum amount which the claimant could receive.

        Although evidence in the record supported the North Carolina Industrial Commission’s judgment that an employee’s cancer was accelerated by injuries the employee sustained in a work-related accident, and the appellate court affirmed the Commission’s decision to award temporary total disability benefits to the employee, the court remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings because the record did not explain how the Commission had determined the employee’s average weekly wage, a determination that was central to its award of benefits, and because there was conflicting evidence in the record which raised questions about the Commission’s findings that a city which employed the employee was entitled to a credit for long-term disability benefits it paid the employee, and that the employee was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.

       This section increases only the weekly compensation benefits in all cases of total and permanent disability occurring prior to July 1, 1973; no provision has been made for an increase in total benefits. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that where a statute is intelligible without any additional words, no additional words may be supplied. Taylor v. J.P. Stevens Co.,

      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission properly held that a workers’ compensation claimant’s arthritic condition in her knees was not compensable as, although a prior award included “problems caused by falls” as compensable conditions, the degenerative arthritis was not the very injury that the Commission had previously determined to be the result of a compensable accident. Clark v. Sanger Clinic, P.A., 175 N.C. App. 76, 623 S.E.2d 293,

      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission properly found that a workers’ compensation claimant’s arthritic condition in her knees was not compensable where, although tears in the claimant’s knees were related to falls, and therefore were compensable, the claimant failed to establish that she had a pre-existing arthritic condition in her knees and an expert testified that a long-standing tear could not cause arthritis of the knee; while there was evidence that the claimant’s falls could have aggravated her degenerative knee condition, there was also testimony that the claimant’s pre-existing obesity could have aggravated the degenerative changes in her knees. Clark v. Sanger Clinic, P.A., 175 N.C. App. 76, 623 S.E.2d 293,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission did not err in holding that the causal relationship between a workers’ compensation claimant’s compensable injuries and the need for restorative dental treatment was tenuous as an expert testified that the claimant’s dental condition could have been caused by poor hygiene, xerostomia (“dry mouth” syndrome), possibly brought on by plaintiff’s medications, stones in her salivary glands, or the six weeks that the claimant was in a coma following her unrelated gastric bypass procedure; while another expert testified that “dry mouth” syndrome was a potential side effect of several of the claimant’s medications, there was no testimony as to what actually caused the claimant’s dental condition. Clark v. Sanger Clinic, P.A., 175 N.C. App. 76, 623 S.E.2d 293,

      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission properly failed to specify treatment for a workers’ compensation claimant’s esophageal reflux, constipation, and nausea as compensable as there was no testimony as to what actually caused the conditions; while a treating physician testified that many of the claimant’s medications had esophageal reflux, constipation, and nausea as side effects, there was no testimony that these conditions were causally related to the claimant’s compensable injuries. Further, the physician testified that the claimant had ample reason to have nausea due to her gastric surgery, the complications from that, and her pain medication; further, if the claimant could establish that the conditions were related to her compensable injuries, her employer was obligated to provide the treatment for the ailments.

Hence, the primary significance of the concept of Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) is to delineate a crucial point in time only within the context of a claim for scheduled benefits under G.S. 97-31; the concept of MMI does not have any direct bearing upon an employee’s right to continue to receive temporary disability benefits once the employee has established a loss of wage-earning capacity pursuant to G.S. 97-29 or G.S. 97-30.

       An award also containing a provision by which the Commission sought to retain jurisdiction during 300 weeks so that claimant might be paid more compensation if he had a wage loss as a result of his injury within that time was held to be error by the Supreme Court, which said, “There is nothing in the statute . . . that contemplates or authorizes an anticipatory finding by the Commission that a physical impairment may develop into a compensable disability. Neither does the statute vest in the Commission the power to retain jurisdiction of a claim, after compensation has been awarded, merely because some physical impairment suffered by the claimant may, at some time in the future, cause a loss of wages. The Commission is concerned with conditions existing prior to and at the time of the hearing. If such conditions change in the future, to the detriment of the claimant, the statute affords the claimant a remedy and fixes the time within which he must seek it.

Hence, the primary significance of the concept of Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) is to delineate a crucial point in time only within the context of a claim for scheduled benefits under G.S. 97-31; the concept of MMI does not have any direct bearing upon an employee’s right to continue to receive temporary disability benefits once the employee has established a loss of wage-earning capacity pursuant to G.S. 97-29 or G.S. 97-30.

        The “healing period” of the injury is the time when the claimant is unable to work because of his injury, is submitting to treatment, which may include an operation or operations, or is convalescing.

        The point at which the injury has stabilized is often called “maximum medical improvement,” although that term is not found in the statute itself. This term creates confusion. It connotes that a claimant is only temporarily totally disabled and his body healing when his condition is steadily improving, and/or he is receiving medical treatment. Carpenter v. Industrial Piping Co., 73 N.C. App. 309, 326 S.E.2d 328,

        Recovery from injuries often entails a healing period of alternating improvement and deterioration. In these cases, the healing period is over when the impaired bodily condition is stabilized, or determined to be permanent, and not at one of the temporary high points. In many cases the body is able to heal itself, and during convalescence doctors refrain from active treatment with surgery or drugs. Thus, the absence of such medical treatment does not mean that the injury has completely improved or that the impaired bodily condition has stabilized. Carpenter v. Industrial Piping Co., 73 N.C. App. 309, 326 S.E.2d 328,

        Where plaintiff ’s “healing period” had stabilized and he had reached his maximum recovery by December 1977, it was this date that marked the termination of his compensation for temporary total disability and the initiation of compensation for permanent disability. And where according to the payment schedule of this section and in accord with the findings of the Commission, plaintiff was entitled to 180 weeks of permanent disability payments, and plaintiff had received nearly 255 weeks of disability payments since that date, plaintiff had already received more than he was entitled by statute to receive, and defendants owed plaintiff no additional compensation.

        While an employee who suffered a laceration of his cornea when a piece of metal hit his eye, presenting a clear danger of retinal detachment in the future, unquestionably sustained a permanent injury to his eye, he did not lose the injured eye or suffer any loss of vision. Since his injury was not specifically encompassed by subdivisions (16) or (19) of this section, or any other subdivision, subdivision (24) was the appropriate basis for the Commission’s award.

        While the evidence tended to support the claim of an employee suffering an eye injury that his risk of some form of future vision impairment was significantly increased, the statutory scheme allowed him to be compensated for “permanent injury,” but made no provision for an additional recovery because the claimant could be subject to a greater risk of permanent disability as a result of his accident. Consequently, the amount awarded — $2,500 — was supported by the evidence. Little v. Penn Ventilator Co., 75 N.C. App. 92, 330 S.E.2d 276,

        A serious disfigurement in fact is a disfigurement that mars and hence adversely affects the appearance of the injured employee to such extent that it may be reasonably presumed to lessen his opportunities for remunerative employment and so reduces his future earning power.

        The Workers’ Compensation Act deals with compensation for reduced capacity for work. A bodily disfigurement, other than facial or head disfigurements which are governed by subdivision (21) of this section, is serious and compensable under subdivision (22) of this section only when it is of such a nature that it may be fairly presumed that it causes to the injured employee a diminution of his future earning capacity.

        Natural physical handicap resulting from the disfigurement, and the age, training, experience, education, occupation and adaptability of the employee to obtain and retain employment are factors to be used in arriving at the diminution of earning power — the amount of an award. It follows, however, that these same factors are to be used as well to determine if any award is to be made, that is, whether the disfigurement is in fact serious and thus compensable under subdivision (22) of this section because it is such as to give rise to the presumption that the worker has suffered a diminution of his future earning power.

        Generally speaking, a lump sum award made prior to decedent’s death is deemed to be an accrued benefit, but logic compels the conclusion that if, pursuant to subdivision (22) of this section, no determination of the lump sum award for disfigurement had been made prior to death, then such entitlements are unaccrued until such time as they are determined, and, for that reason, the payment of the lump sum award for disfigurement would pass to the worker’s dependents pursuant to this section rather than to the deceased worker’s estate.

However, benefits are awarded under subdivision (24) for loss of a permanent injury to important external or internal organs or parts of the body, and the Commission properly used subdivision (24) in awarding benefits. Proof of diminished wage-earning capacity is not required under subdivision (24). Stanley v. Gore Bros., 82 N.C. App. 511, 347 S.E.2d 49,

        Claim for compensation due to an alleged loss of the sense of smell and damage to the nerves and muscles in the right side of face was not barred by the passage of time and the doctrine of res judicata, where these symptoms did not manifest themselves immediately after the accident, and the first opinion and award filed in the matter covered only claimant’s loss of vision and the disfigurement of his face.

        Findings Held Inadequate to Establish Disability. —

      <p>
       Employer need not show that the employee was specifically offered a job by some other employer in order to prove that the employee was capable of obtaining suitable employment, but instead, the crucial question is whether the employee can obtain a job; the testimony of a vocational counselor that identified approximately 12 jobs that were suitable for the employee and which detailed the employee’s failure to keep appointments and his balky behavior at the job interviews raised an issue of fact with respect to the compensability of the employee’s injury, and, thus, the industrial commission’s findings were inadequate to establish that the employee was disabled.

        Industrial Commission Failed to Make Adequate Findings of Fact. —

      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina Industrial Commission’s conclusion that an employee refused suitable employment was not supported by adequate findings of fact because in its findings of fact, the Commission merely recited the evidence the employer submitted in its application to suspend the employee’s temporary total disability compensation and did not make a finding of the wages the employee would have earned as a service writer/advisor when that job was offered to him; the Commission did not compare the wages the employee would have earned in the new position with those he was earning at the time of injury, and without such comparison, the Commission could not determine the suitability of the offered employment.

       Whether an employee was justified in refusing a position his employer offered him on the ground that the employer failed to show that it was physically suitable was remanded to the North Carolina Industrial Commission for further findings of fact because the Commission’s opinion and award contained no findings addressing the employee’s ability to perform the position offered to him considering his age, education, physical limitations, vocational skills, and experience; the Commission’s findings of fact constituted recitations of the evidence and not findings of fact that supported the Commission’s conclusions as to suitability.

       North Carolina Industrial Commission properly considered the issue of an employee’s refusal of employment and made relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law because the issue was before both the special deputy commissioner and the deputy commissioner; in denying the employer’s application to terminate the employee’s disability benefits, the special deputy commissioner considered both the suitability of the employee’s prior employment and her failure to return to that employment, and in her review of the special deputy commissioner’s order, the deputy commissioner found that the position the employer offered the employee was suitable employment for the employee and that her refusal of the position was not justified.

       Where defendants did not assert any other reason for termination of plaintiff’s benefits besides “return to work” on the Form 28T, the record revealed that the plaintiff denied that she ever attempted a “trial return to work” and that she, therefore, was not required to file a Form 28U, and it was undisputed that defendants did not file a Form 24 seeking to terminate plaintiff’s compensation on grounds other than plaintiff’s “return to work”, the only issue before the Full Commission was whether or not plaintiff had returned to work, warranting termination of benefits pursuant to G.S. 97-18.1(b); thus, it did not consider the issue of whether or not plaintiff had wage earning capacity and neither would the Court of Appeals.

       conferred jurisdiction on the North Carolina Industrial Commission, even though a workers’ compensation claimant was injured in South Carolina, as the claimant’s contract for employment was created in North Carolina since: (1) the employer’s operations head made the final decision to hire the claimant in Massachusetts; (2) the operations head telephoned an employer’s representative in North Carolina, and informed the representative that the operations head had the claimant set up to work; (3) the employer offered the claimant a job when the representative in Raleigh, North Carolina telephoned the claimant at the claimant’s home in Durham, North Carolina; (4) the claimant reported to work in Raleigh, North Carolina and was dispatched to Roanoke, Virginia by the representative; and (5) the claimant’s acceptance of employment in North Carolina was the “last act” that created the contract for employment with the employer.

       North Carolina Industrial Commission erred in holding that modification of an existing contract did not fall within the scope of a contract “made” in the statute because a modification of an employment contract could be a proper basis to find a contract was “made” within North Carolina; the General Assembly crafted the statute with a full view that the phrase employment contract contemplated both contracts of hire as well as modifications of existing contracts, which are new agreements.

       For the North Carolina Industrial Commission to have jurisdiction in this case, the worker’s contract had to have been made in North Carolina; the worker was required to complete a three-day orientation, a road test, a drug test, and a physical exam in Mississippi, a procedure extending beyond mostly paperwork, and the fact that the worker was paid for this period did not vitiate the fact that his employment was contingent on successful completion of the orientation and tests, and thus his last act of the employment contract took place in Mississippi and the Commission lacked jurisdiction.

        The substantial dependency standard is a question of fact to be determined under the facts of each case, the burden of proof being on the stepchild under the evidentiary standards normally employed in workers’ compensation cases. The factors to be considered are the actual amount and consistency of the support derived by the stepchild from (1) the deceased stepparent, (2) the natural parent married to the stepparent, (3) the estranged natural parent, whether such support is voluntary or required by law, (4) the income of the stepchild, and (5) any other funds regularly received for the support of the stepchild.

     <p>
      A widow, a widower and/or a child shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee. In all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part shall be determined in accordance with the facts as the facts may be at the time of the accident, but no allowance shall be made for any payment made in lieu of board and lodging or services, and no compensation shall be allowed unless the dependency existed for a period of three months or more prior to the accident. If there is more than one person wholly dependent, the death benefit shall be divided among them, the persons partly dependent, if any, shall receive no part thereof. If there is no one wholly dependent, and more than one person partially dependent, the death benefit shall be divided among them according to the relative extent of their dependency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The widow, or widower and all children of deceased employees shall be conclusively presumed to be dependents of deceased and shall be entitled to receive the benefits of this Article for the full periods specified herein.

       The substantial dependency standard is a question of fact to be determined under the facts of each case, the burden of proof being on the stepchild under the evidentiary standards normally employed in workers’ compensation cases. The factors to be considered are the actual amount and consistency of the support derived by the stepchild from (1) the deceased stepparent, (2) the natural parent married to the stepparent, (3) the estranged natural parent, whether such support is voluntary or required by law, (4) the income of the stepchild, and (5) any other funds regularly received for the support of the stepchild.

For all such next of kin who are neither wholly nor partially dependent upon the deceased employee and who take under this section, the order of priority among them shall be governed by the general law applicable to the distribution of the personal estate of persons dying intestate. In the event of exclusion of a parent based on abandonment, the claim for compensation benefits shall be treated as though the abandoning parent had predeceased the employee. For all such next of kin who were also partially dependent on the deceased employee but who exercise the election provided for partial dependents by G.S. 97-38, the general law applicable to the distribution of the personal estate of persons dying intestate shall not apply and such person or persons upon the exercise of such election, shall be entitled, share and share alike, to the compensation provided in G.S. 97-38 for whole dependents commuted to its present value and paid in a lump sum.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the deceased employee leaves neither whole dependents, partial dependents, nor next of kin as hereinabove defined, then no compensation shall be due or payable on account of the death of the deceased employee, except that the employer shall pay or cause to be paid the burial expenses of the deceased employee not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to the person or persons entitled thereto.

     <p>
      Payments made by the employer to the injured employee during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, which by the terms of this Article were not due and payable when made, may, subject to the approval of the Commission be deducted from the amount to be paid as compensation. Provided, that in the case of disability such deductions shall be made by shortening the period during which compensation must be paid, and not by reducing the amount of the weekly payment. Unless otherwise provided by the plan, when payments are made to an injured employee pursuant to an employer-funded salary continuation, disability or other income replacement plan, the deduction shall be calculated from payments made by the employer in each week during which compensation was due and payable, without any carry-forward or carry-back of credit for amounts paid in excess of the compensation rate in any given week.

However, remand was necessary as to other payments made by the employer to determine whether the employer was entitled to credit regarding injury protection payments that were paid out of an employee-funded plan and injured reserve pay paid to the employee one year.

       An employer who has paid an employee wage-replacement benefits under a private benefit plan at the time of that employee’s greatest need should not be penalized by being denied full credit for the amount paid as against the amount which was subsequently determined to be due the employee under the Workers’ Compensation Act; to do so would inevitably cause employers to be less generous, and the result would be that the employee would lose his or her full salary at the very moment he or she needs it most.

Further, dollar-for-dollar credits were precluded by North Carolina law as a payment that the player received for the last game of the season that he missed was made by the player’s union under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement could not relieve the employer, in whole or in part, from its obligation to pay the player workers’ compensation.

       <p>
        Claimant, following a back injury, returned to the same employer and was paid the same wages as before his injury although he was doing lighter work. The award of the Commission found as a fact that claimant was being paid wages “in lieu of compensation” and retained jurisdiction for 300 weeks from the date of injury so that future adjustments might be made in compensation payable should employee suffer any wage loss due to his injury within that period. The Supreme Court affirmed this action, saying that the Commission did not exceed its authority in thus retaining jurisdiction to protect the employee against imposition by the employer. Branham v.

        There is nothing in the act that contemplates or authorizes an anticipatory finding by the Commission that a physical impairment may develop into a compensable disability. Neither does the act vest in the Commission the power to retain jurisdiction of a claim, after compensation has been awarded, merely because some physical impairment suffered by the claimant may, at some time in the future, cause a loss of wages. The Commission is concerned with conditions existing prior to and at the time of the hearing. If such conditions change in the future, to the detriment of the claimant, this section affords the claimant a remedy and fixes the time within which he must seek it. Dail v. Kellex Corp.,

        Claimant suffered multiple injuries in a wreck. After hearing, the Commission found as a fact that he had suffered 20 percent permanent partial disability. However, it also found that he was suffering no wage loss as a result of injury at the time of hearing. It did not appear that he was being paid wages in lieu of compensation. On the further finding that the physical impairment might cause loss of wages in the future, the Commission attempted to retain jurisdiction during 300 weeks from the date of injury.

        Where plaintiff was unable to find another job, due to his severe physical restrictions, coupled with his vocational and educational limits, because the record was rife with testimony that plaintiff suffered a compensable work-related injury which caused damage to the lumbar region of plaintiff’s back, and Industrial Commission was able to determine that subsequent accident caused a “temporary flare-up” of plaintiff’s pre-existing injury, it followed that plaintiff’s change in wage earning capacity must have been a result of that same pre-existing injury; the Commission’s findings and conclusions to the contrary were unsupported by the evidence and were therefore reversed.

        Change of condition refers to conditions different from those existent when the award was made, and a continued incapacity of the same kind and character and for the same injury is not a change of condition; the change must be actual, and not a mere change of opinion with respect to the pre-existing condition.

        Test for Determining if Lent Employee Entered Employment Relationship with Special Employer. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the statutory requirement that the employment be under an “appointment or contract of hire,” the first question which must be answered in determining whether a lent employee has entered into an employment relationship with a special employer for Workers’ Compensation Act purposes is: Did he make a contract of hire with the special employer? If this question cannot be answered “yes,” the investigation is closed, and this must necessarily be so, since the employee loses certain rights along with those he gains when he strikes up a new employment relation.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The necessity for the lent employee’s consent to a new employment relation stems from the statutory requirement of “contract of hire.” Collins v. James Paul Edwards, Inc., 21 N.C. App. 455, 204 S.E.2d 873,

      </p>
      <p>
       The only presumption in lent employee cases
       
       is the continuance of the general employment, which is taken for granted as the beginning point of any lent employee problem. Collins v. James Paul Edwards, Inc., 21 N.C. App. 455, 204 S.E.2d 873,
       <cite class="nc_code">

      </p>
      <p>
       To overcome this presumption,
       
       it is not unreasonable to insist upon a clear demonstration that a new temporary employer has been substituted for the old, which demonstration should include a showing that a contract was made between the special employer and the employee, proof that the work being done was essentially that of the special employer, and proof that the special employer assumed the right to control the details of the work; failing this, the general employer should remain liable.

       What gives the lent employee cases their special character is the fact that they begin, not with an unknown relation, but with an existing employment relation. The conflict of interest becomes one not between employer and employee (who is assured of recovering from someone) but between two employers and their insurance carriers. Collins v.

       In two workers’ compensation cases relating to exposure to asbestos, employees did not have “covered claims” because their last injurious exposure to asbestos occurred before an insolvent employer was a member of the North Carolina Self-Insurance Security Association. The appellate court could not interpret a workers’ compensation statute in a manner contrary to its plain and unambiguous language, even if this interpretation barred recovery by the employees, who had no other recourse due to the employer’s bankruptcy.

       Because disability measures an employee’s present ability to earn wages, and is unrelated to a decision to withdraw from the labor force by retirement, the Commission may not deny disability benefits because the claimant retired, where there is evidence of diminished earning capacity caused by an occupational disease.

       G.S. 97-92(a) requires an employer to report any injury by accident if it keeps the employee from work for more than one day. Presumably this would include notice of an occupational disease which is considered an injury by accident. Knight v. Cannon Mills Co., 82 N.C. App. 453, 347 S.E.2d 832,

         The term “harmful noise” means sound in employment capable of producing occupational loss of hearing as hereinafter defined. Sound of an intensity of less than 90 decibels, A scale, shall be deemed incapable of producing occupational loss of hearing as defined in this section.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328b">
         “Occupational loss of hearing” shall mean a permanent sensorineural loss of hearing in both ears caused by prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment. Except in instances of preexisting loss of hearing due to disease, trauma, or congenital deafness in one ear, no compensation shall be payable under this subdivision unless prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment has caused loss of hearing in both ears as hereinafter provided.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328c">
         No compensation benefits shall be payable for temporary total or temporary partial disability under this subdivision and there shall be no award for tinnitus or a psychogenic hearing loss.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328d">
         An employer shall become liable for the entire occupational hearing loss to which his employment has contributed, but if previous deafness is established by a hearing test or other competent evidence, whether or not the employee was exposed to harmful noise within six months preceding such test, the employer shall not be liable for previous loss so established, nor shall he be liable for any loss for which compensation has previously been paid or awarded and the employer shall be liable only for the difference between the percent of occupational hearing loss determined as of the date of disability as herein defined and the percentage of loss established by the preemployment and audiometric examination excluding, in any event, hearing losses arising from nonoccupational causes.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328e">
         In the evaluation of occupational hearing loss, only the hearing levels at the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second shall be considered. Hearing losses for frequencies below 500 and above 3,000 cycles per second are not to be considered as constituting compensable hearing disability.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328f">
         The employer liable for the compensation in this section shall be the employer in whose employment the employee was last exposed to harmful noise in North Carolina during a period of 90 working days or parts thereof, and an exposure during a period of less than 90 working days or parts thereof shall be held not to be an injurious exposure; provided, however, that in the event an insurance carrier has been on the risk for a period of time during which an employee has been injuriously exposed to harmful noise, and if after insurance carrier goes off the risk said employee has been further exposed to harmful noise, although not exposed for 90 working days or parts thereof so as to constitute an injurious exposure, such carrier shall, nevertheless, be liable.

         The percentage of hearing loss shall be calculated as the average, in decibels, of the thresholds of hearing for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric instruments, properly calibrated according to accepted national standards such as American Standards Association, Inc., (ASA), International Standards Organization (ISO), or American National Standards Institute, Inc., (ANSI), shall be used for measuring hearing loss. If more than one audiogram is taken, the audiogram having the lowest threshold will be used to calculate occupational hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 15 decibels (26 db if ANSI or ISO) or less in the four frequencies, such losses of hearing shall not constitute any compensable hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 82 decibels (93 db if ANSI or ISO) or more in the four frequencies, then the same shall constitute and be total or one hundred percent (100%) compensable hearing loss. In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest measured losses in each of the four frequencies shall be added together and divided by four to determine the average decibel loss. For each decibel of loss exceeding 15 decibels (26 db if ANSI or ISO) an allowance of one and one-half percent (11/2%) shall be made up to the maximum of one hundred percent (100%) which is reached at 82 decibels (93 db if ANSI or ISO). In determining the binaural percentage of loss, the percentage of impairment in the better ear shall be multiplied by five. The resulting figure shall be added to the percentage of impairment in the poorer ear, and the sum of the two divided by six. The final percentage shall represent the binaural hearing impairment.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328h">
         There shall be payable for total occupational loss of hearing in both ears 150 weeks of compensation, and for partial occupational loss of hearing in both ears such proportion of these periods of payment as such partial loss bears to total loss.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328i">
         No claim for compensation for occupational hearing loss shall be filed until after six months have elapsed since exposure to harmful noise with the last employer. The last day of such exposure shall be the date of disability. The regular use of employer-provided protective devices capable of preventing loss of hearing from the particular harmful noise where the employee works shall constitute removal from exposure to such particular harmful noise.
        </li>
        <li id="t97a01s97-53ol328j">
         No consideration shall be given to the question of whether or not the ability of an employee to understand speech is improved by the use of a hearing aid. The North Carolina Industrial Commission may order the employer to provide the employee with an original hearing aid if it will materially improve the employee’s ability to hear.
        </li>

         No compensation benefits shall be payable for the loss of hearing caused by harmful noise after October 1, 1971, if employee fails to regularly utilize employer-provided protection device or devices, capable of preventing loss of hearing from the particular harmful noise where the employee works.

        Former subdivision (26), which was added to this section by Session Laws 1949, c. 1078, and which purported to make certain forms of heart disease compensable occupational diseases when suffered by firemen, was unconstitutional, since it sought to confer upon firemen a special privilege not accorded to other municipal employees, nor to employees in private industry, and created for firemen substantial financial benefits, to be paid from the public treasury under the guise of workers’ compensation benefits, without establishing an occupational disease as the usual incident or result of the particular employment.

         What Constitutes Occupational Disease. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subdivision (13) of this section, any disease is an occupational disease if it is due to causes and conditions peculiarly characteristic of the worker’s particular trade, occupation or employment, and if the disease is not one that the general public, outside of the particular employment, stands an equal risk of contracting. The statute contains no other conditions and excludes no particular diseases, including the ordinary diseases of life. Thomason v. Fiber Indus., 78 N.C. App. 159, 336 S.E.2d 632,

       </p>
       <p>
        A disease is an occupational disease compensable under this section if claimant’s employment exposed him to a greater risk of contracting this disease than members of the public generally and such exposure significantly contributed to, or was a significant causal factor in, the disease’s development.

       <p>
        Competent evidence supported the Industrial Commission’s conclusion that a workers’ compensation claimant did not prove he developed an occupational disease due to conditions characteristic of his employment because his hyperactive airways disease was caused by his personal, unusual sensitivity to small amounts of certain chemicals.

        Employee who was exposed to toxic chemicals in the course of his employment spray-painting automobiles showed his exposure to workplace chemicals caused or significantly contributed to his lung disease, as he showed: (1) the disease was characteristic of persons engaged in his occupation; (2) the disease was not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public was equally exposed with those engaged in his occupation, as his employment exposed him to the chemicals to a greater extent than the exposure experienced by the general public and the agent to which he had a greater exposure was the cause of his disease; and (3) there was a causal connection between the disease and his employment.

Any evaluation of the workplace for the agent in question after claimant’s departure would not quantify claimant’s exposure, but would merely “guessimate” it.

        Whether a given illness falls within the general definition set out in subdivision (13) presents a mixed question of fact and law. The Commission must determine first the nature of the disease from which the plaintiff is suffering, that is, its characteristics, symptoms and manifestations. Ordinarily, such findings will be based on expert medical testimony. Having made appropriate findings of fact, the next question the Commission must answer is whether or not the illness which plaintiff has contracted falls within the definition set out in the statute.

App. 187, 552 S.E.2d 202 (2001), that the evidence and the Industrial Commission’s findings did not support the Commission’s conclusions that plaintiff’s employment exposed her to a greater risk of contracting depression and fibromyalgia than the public generally and that her depression and fibromyalgia were therefore compensable occupational diseases. Although plaintiff suffered from depression and fibromyalgia after being placed in the unfortunate position of working for an abusive supervisor, such conditions can occur with any employee in any industry or profession, or in similar abusive relationships outside the workplace, and cannot be construed as ‘characteristic of and peculiar to‘ her particular employment, and were therefore non-compensable.

Temporary total disability award had to be reversed and remanded for consideration of whether the employee (1) was incapable after her injury of earning the same wages she had earned before her injury in the same employment, (2) was incapable after her injury of earning the same wages she had earned before her injury in any other employment, and (3) whether her incapacity was caused by her injury.

        Synovitis is the inflammation of a synovial membrane and tenosynovitis or tendosynovitis is the inflammation of a synovial membrane which forms the protective sheath that encloses the tendon. It is sometimes used to denote the inflammation of both the sheath and the tendon. Henry v. A.C. Lawrence Leather Co.,

       <p>
        The causative origin of tenosynovitis is either infection or trauma. The clause “caused by trauma in employment” was used by the legislature to modify the word “tenosynovitis” so as to include the occupational and exclude the infectious type, i.e., to include the traumatic and exclude the idiopathic. Henry v. A.C. Lawrence Leather Co.,

       </p>
       <p>
        In using the modifying phrase, “caused by trauma in employment,” the legislature necessarily meant a series of events in employment occurring regularly, or at frequent intervals, over an extended period of time, and culminating in the condition technically known as tenosynovitis. Henry v. A.C. Lawrence Leather Co.,

        A single blow on the arm might bruise the extensor tendons to such an extent as to cause temporary tenosynovitis. The resulting condition would be properly termed an injury by accident caused by trauma. But it would not constitute an occupational disease, for an occupational disease is a diseased or morbid condition which develops gradually, and is produced by a series of events in employment occurring over a period of time.

        North Carolina Industrial Commission did not err in denying benefits for asbestosis and lung cancer where there was competent evidence in the record to support the Commission’s findings regarding the employee’s last injurious exposure to asbestos, and where the Commission applied the correct legal standard in evaluating both claims; the evidence supported a reasonable inference that the employee was exposed to asbestos for at least 30 days or parts thereof within seven consecutive months while working for a different employer, and the employee’s last injurious exposure to the hazards of asbestosis occurred with the different employer.

        Industrial Commission did not place an impermissible burden of establishing the amount of exposure to asbestos on the claimants because consideration of the form of asbestos, the quantity of asbestos exposure, and the frequency of exposure was appropriate in determining whether asbestos exposure at the factory was a significant causal factor in the development of the claimants’ alleged asbestos. Therefore, the Commission’s ultimate finding that the greater weight of the evidence showed that the claimants were not exposed to airborne asbestos in such form and quantity and with such frequency as to cause asbestosis did not show that the Commission placed an impermissible burden on claimants.

        Industrial Commission did not err by relying on air sampling or non-medical evidence that there was not sufficient exposure to asbestos at the factory to contribute to or cause an asbestos-related disease, and the results of the lung tissue analyses of the deceased claimants were direct evidence that none had asbestosis and was circumstantial evidence supporting the Commission’s determination that the claimants had failed to prove a causal connection between asbestosis and employment at the factory.

        The following legal standard determines whether a claimant suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease has a compensable occupational disease under subdivision (13): The occupation in question must have exposed the worker to a greater risk of contracting this disease than members of the public generally, and provided the worker’s exposure to cotton dust significantly contributed to, or was a significant causal factor in, the disease’s development. This is so even if other non-work related factors also make significant contributions, or were significant causal factors. Gibson v. Little Cotton Mfg. Co., 73 N.C. App. 143, 325 S.E.2d 698,

        Byssinosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are not among the prima facie occupational diseases listed in this section. Therefore, to be “occupational” under the catch-all provision of subdivision (13), the plaintiff’s disease must be characteristic of persons engaged in the particular trade or occupation in which the claimant is engaged, and not an ordinary disease of life to which the public generally is equally exposed with those engaged in that particular trade or occupation, and there must be a causal connection between the disease and the claimant’s employment.

       This section clearly states that disablement begins when a claimant is incapacitated because of asbestosis or silicosis from earning in the same or any other employment the wages he earned at the time of his last injurious exposure to silicosis or asbestosis. It simply does not require that “any other employment” be a “dusty” trade. Martin v. Petroleum Tank Serv., 65 N.C. App. 565, 309 S.E.2d 536,

       In ascertaining the right to compensation in cases involving occupational diseases
       
       such as silicosis, the Industrial Commission must ordinarily determine (1) whether the plaintiff in fact has an occupational disease, (2) whether, and to what extent, the plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of this section, and (3) to what degree any such disability is caused by the occupational disease.

       Unlike disablement from other occupational diseases, disablement from silicosis and asbestosis is measured from the time a claimant can no longer work at dusty trades, not from the time he can no longer work at any job. Taylor v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co.,

       An employee does not contract or develop asbestosis or silicosis in a few weeks or months. These diseases develop as the result of exposure for many years to asbestos dust or dust of silica. Both diseases, according to the textbook writers, are incurable and usually result in total permanent disability. Therefore, it would seem that the victims of these incurable occupational diseases constitute a legitimate burden on the industries in which they were exposed to the hazards that produced their disablement. Such was the intent of the legislature. Honeycutt v. Carolina Asbestos Co.,

       Plaintiff did not become disabled within the meaning of the Workers’ Compensation Act until June 3, 1982, when he was forced to stop work of any kind because of his occupational disease. Because plaintiff was able to earn the wages he had always received until that date, the arguments as to when plaintiff was first informed of the nature and work-related cause of his disease were irrelevant. Thus his claim, filed on February 2, 1983, was timely. Underwood v. Cone Mills Corp., 78 N.C. App. 155, 336 S.E.2d 634,

       Industrial Commission did not err by relying on air sampling or non-medical evidence that there was not sufficient exposure to asbestos at the factory to contribute to or cause an asbestos-related disease, and the results of the lung tissue analyses of the deceased claimants were direct evidence that none had asbestosis and was circumstantial evidence supporting the Commission’s determination that the claimants had failed to prove a causal connection between asbestosis and employment at the factory.

       Industrial Commission did not place an impermissible burden of establishing the amount of exposure to asbestos on the claimants because consideration of the form of asbestos, the quantity of asbestos exposure, and the frequency of exposure was appropriate in determining whether asbestos exposure at the factory was a significant causal factor in the development of the claimants’ alleged asbestos. Therefore, the Commission’s ultimate finding that the greater weight of the evidence showed that the claimants were not exposed to airborne asbestos in such form and quantity and with such frequency as to cause asbestosis did not show that the Commission placed an impermissible burden on claimants.

       Due to the nature of silicosis, it is essential to establish the presence of the disease by competent medical authority. But where it has been established that a person who has been exposed to free silica dust has developed silicosis to the extent that it may be disabling, testimony other than that of a medical expert may be admitted and considered in determining when such person actually became disabled or disabled to work. Certainly, a victim of silicosis is competent to testify to his lessened capacity to work, his shortness of breath, and the effect that physical exertion has upon him, all of which are normal symptoms of silicosis.

       The rule under this section, assigning liability to the employer where the employee was last injuriously exposed, serves to eliminate the need for complex and expensive litigation of the issue of relative contribution by each of several employments to a plaintiff ’s occupational disease. The possibility that some employers may bear a disproportionate share of the total liability for occupational disease is a problem for the legislature, not the courts, to consider. Frady v.

       Any suggestion of comparative responsibility as between successive employers and their respective carriers, or as between successive carriers for the same employer, is dispelled by the plain language of this section.

       In order for a substance to be a “hazard” of an occupational disease within the meaning of this section, it must be a substance peculiar to the workplace. By this it is meant that the substance is one to which the worker has a greater exposure on the job than does the public generally, either because of the nature of the substance itself or because the concentrations of the substance in the workplace are greater than concentrations to which the public generally is exposed.

The Commission could not arbitrarily select any 30 days of employment, other than the last 30 days, within the seven months’ period for convenience or protection of any of the parties, even if there was some evidence which may be construed to support such selection.

       Where the evidence supported findings of the Industrial Commission that an employee suffering disability from silicosis was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease for 30 working days within seven consecutive calendar months while in the employment of defendant, this section placed liability therefor upon such employer and his insurance carrier during that period, and the mere fact that the employee was advised that he had silicosis prior to the expiration of this 30-day period but continued for a short time to perform his same work was insufficient, standing alone, to sustain the insurance carrier’s contention that his employment after the discovery of the disease was in bad faith so as to make the loss fall upon it.

The employer became self-insured on June 2, 2006, and the Commission’s finding that the worker’s last injurious exposure occurred on August 9, 2006 was supported by competent evidence in the record and was therefore binding on appeal.

       Decedent’s death was compensable because the testimony of a co-worker, coupled with other competent testimony, showed that the decedent was exposed to asbestos, while working for the decedent’s employer as a service technician in the repair, installation, and maintenance of home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, for at least thirty days within six consecutive months.

       Industrial Commission did not err in finding that an employee’s last injurious exposure to asbestos, which contributed to his development of an occupational disease, occurred during the thirty years he worked for his primary lifetime employer, based on the testimony of his former coworkers and medical experts, and in the absence of any evidence that he was exposed to asbestos at any subsequent job.

       Competent evidence supported the Industrial Commission’s determination that the claimant failed to prove a causal connection between his employment at the factory and his alleged asbestosis because the claimant did not challenge the finding that the post-mortem pathological study of the claimant’s lung tissue revealed no pathological evidence of asbestosis, multiple doctors stated that the claimant’s x-rays did not show evidence of pleural abnormalities or asbestosis, the claimant’s treating physician told him to inform his attorney that the abnormal x-ray was due to pneumonia, and even though the claimant testified that he never smoked medical records and his pathology results indicated he had a remote smoking history.

       Industrial Commission did not err by relying on air sampling or non-medical evidence that there was not sufficient exposure to asbestos at the factory to contribute to or cause an asbestos-related disease, and the results of the lung tissue analyses of the deceased claimants were direct evidence that none had asbestosis and was circumstantial evidence supporting the Commission’s determination that the claimants had failed to prove a causal connection between asbestosis and employment at the factory.

       Industrial Commission did not place an impermissible burden of establishing the amount of exposure to asbestos on the claimants because consideration of the form of asbestos, the quantity of asbestos exposure, and the frequency of exposure was appropriate in determining whether asbestos exposure at the factory was a significant causal factor in the development of the claimants’ alleged asbestos. Therefore, the Commission’s ultimate finding that the greater weight of the evidence showed that the claimants were not exposed to airborne asbestos in such form and quantity and with such frequency as to cause asbestosis did not show that the Commission placed an impermissible burden on claimants.

        Though the two-year time limit for timely filing is a jurisdictional requisite, without which the Commission may not consider a workers’ compensation claim, the time does not begin to run against occupational disease claims until the employee is informed by competent medical authority of the nature and work-related cause of the disease.

        Two conditions must be met in order to start the two-year statute of limitations running against a claimant: (1) The employee must have suffered an occupational disease which renders the employee incapable of earning, at any job, the wages the employee was receiving at the time of the incapacity, and (2) the employee has been informed by competent medical authority of the nature and work-related cause of the disease.

       In a workers’ compensation case wherein the employee was awarded compensation after being found permanently and totally disabled, the North Carolina Industrial Commission erred by failing to expressly rule on whether the employer was required to reimburse the employee for past out-of-pocket medical expenses; while it appeared from the emphasis in the Commission’s opinion and award, which ordered the employer to pay medical expenses as well as from its decision not to hold the employer in civil contempt, that the Commission implicitly ruled that the employee did not timely submit his request for reimbursement of $1,965.13 in past out-of-pocket medical expenses, the better approach for the Commission was to expressly respond to the issues raised by the employee’s appeal.

       Plaintiff failed to properly preserve his right to appeal
       
       the failure of the Deputy Commissioner to order payment of medical expenses under this section, where there was no evidence in the record that the matter was ever addressed by the full commission, the plaintiff did not appeal from the Deputy Commissioner’s opinion and award, and the sole issue on appeal before the full commission was the propriety of the amounts awarded for loss of lung function and attorneys’ fees.

        Constitutionality. —

      <p>
       Assuming arguendo that defendant employer did have standing to assert a constitutional challenge to this section on the basis that it treats employees with asbestosis or silicosis differently than employees who contract occupational diseases other than asbestosis or silicosis, the court agreed with the Commission that the statute was not unconstitutional; enacted as an added benefit to employees suffering from asbestosis or silicosis, its purpose to account for the incurable, latent, and unique nature of asbestosis and silicosis, factors not apparent in other occupational diseases, the statute survives minimum scrutiny.

      <p>
       There is no indication that the legislature intended to prohibit any recovery whatsoever to those employees who refused to remove themselves from contact with asbestos after being diagnosed as having asbestosis. The statutory language merely prohibits recovery for actual partial incapacity if the employee, after receiving initial compensation in the form of 104 weeks of
       installment payments, is shown to have remained in a job where he or she is exposed to asbestos. Roberts v. Southeastern Magnesia &amp; Asbestos Co., 61 N.C. App. 706, 301 S.E.2d 742,

       The intent of the legislature in providing for an automatic 104 installment payments was to encourage employees to remove themselves from hazardous exposure to asbestos and to provide for employee rehabilitation.

       The fourth paragraph of this section provides two conditions
       
       under which dependents of a deceased employee, who had silicosis, are entitled to compensation on account of his death: (1) If death results from silicosis within two years from the date of last exposure, or (2) if death results within 350 weeks from the date of last exposure and while the employee is entitled to compensation for disablement due to silicosis, either partial or total. These conditions are stated in independent clauses of a compound sentence, and neither clause is dependent upon the other. Davis v. North Carolina Granite Corp.,

       Under this section the dependents of a deceased employee are entitled to compensation if the employee dies within 350 weeks from the date of last exposure to silicosis and while he is receiving or is entitled to receive compensation for disability due to silicosis, either partial or total, notwithstanding that the death does not result from silicosis.

        Appeal Under Expedited Medical Motions Procedure Is Interlocutory. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal of an employer and its carrier of a North Carolina Industrial Commission order directing them to authorize radiofrequency ablation treatments for an employee was dismissed because the order was interlocutory since the ruling was under the medical motions procedure, G.S. 97-78(f) and (g), and was not a final ruling that determined all issues, and the appeal did not affect a substantial rights; the employer and carrier sought a determination that the medical conditions of which the employee complained were not caused by a compensable injury and that the radiofrequency ablation treatment should not have been authorized, but that issue had yet to be ruled upon by the Industrial Commission, and the court of appeals had already affirmed the ruling of the Industrial Commission that denied the employer’s motion to terminate the employee’s temporary total disability benefits.

      <p>
       Where defendants appeal from an order of the North Carolina Industrial Commission issued under the Expedited Medical Motions Procedure, such appeal is interlocutory and not properly before the appellate court because the enactment of G.S. 97-78(f) and (g) by the General Assembly mandates that medical treatment issues be handled expeditiously. In order to comply with these statutory amendments, rulings must necessarily be expedited, are interlocutory, and entered without prejudice to the subsequent resolution of the contested issues in the case.

       When a deputy commissioner ordered the deposition of an unrepresented claimant’s physician, she did not indicate a disqualifying personal bias or deprive the employer of an impartial decision maker in violation of the employer’s due process rights because, under G.S. 97-80(d), the Industrial Commission could order the deposition of a witness, under G.S. 97-79(b), the deputy commissioner had the same powers as members of the Industrial Commission, and, under

       “(d) If the employer, carrier, or administrator timely objects to the Form 23 Application to Reinstate Payment of Disability Compensation, the Commission shall conduct an informal hearing within 25 days of the receipt by the Commission of the Form 23 Application to Reinstate Payment of Disability Compensation unless the time is extended for good cause shown. The informal hearing may be conducted with the parties or their attorneys of record personally present with the Commission. The Commission shall make arrangements for the informal hearing with a view toward conducting the hearing in the most expeditious manner. The informal hearing shall be no more than 30 minutes, with each side being given 10 minutes to present its case and five minutes for rebuttal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employee may waive the right to an informal hearing and proceed to a formal hearing by filing a request for hearing on a Form 33 Request that Claim be Assigned for Hearing. Either party may appeal the Administrative Decision and Order of the Commission as provided by Rule .0703 of this subchapter. A Deputy Commissioner shall conduct a hearing which shall be a hearing de novo. The hearing shall be peremptorily set and shall not require a Form 33 Request that Claim be Assigned for Hearing. The employee has the burden of producing evidence on the issue of the employee’s application to reinstate compensation. If the Deputy Commissioner reverses an order previously granting a Form 23 Application to Reinstate Payment of Disability Compensation motion, the employer shall promptly terminate compensation or otherwise comply with the Deputy Commissioner’s decision, notwithstanding any appeal or application for review to the Full Commission under

If additional issues are to be addressed, the employee, employer, carrier, or administrator shall file a Form 33 Request that Claim be Assigned for Hearing or notify the Commission that a formal hearing is not currently necessary, within 30 days of the date of the Administrative Decision or Order. The effect of placing the case on the docket shall be the same as if the Form 23 Application to Reinstate Payment of Disability Compensation was denied, and compensation shall not be reinstated until such time as the case is decided by a Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner following a formal hearing.’

       Session Laws 2017-124, s. 1(b), provides: “In enacting subsection (a) of this section, it is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify, in response to

    that an injury not identified in an award arising out of G.S. 97-18(b) or G.S. 97-18(d) is not presumed to be causally related to the compensable injury to reflect the intent of the General Assembly when it enacted S.L. 2011-287.”

        Presumption Additional Medical Treatment Related to Compensable Condition. —

      <p>
       Court of appeals properly vacated the North Carolina Industrial Commission’s finding that an employee failed to establish that his anxiety and depression were a result of his work-related accident because the employee was entitled to a presumption that additional medical treatment was related to his compensable conditions; the Commission did not apply any presumption, and instead placed the initial burden on the employee to prove causation for any medical compensation he sought.

       Continually placing the burden on an employee to prove that his or her symptoms are causally related to his or her admittedly compensable injury before he or she can receive further medical treatment ignores the prior award; accordingly, an admission of compensability approved under the Workers’ Compensation Act entitles an employee to a presumption that additional medical treatment is causally related to his or her compensable injury.

       After plaintiff had been awarded compensation for partial disability, a hearing was had to determine whether there had been a change of condition. Plaintiff alleged partial deafness.

       Appellate courts must follow the “any competent evidence” standard in deciding whether the evidence permits a determination by the Commission, which is the fact-finder. The fact-finder, however, is not required so to view the evidence. Rather, its duty is to weigh the evidence, resolve conflicts therein, and make its own determination as to weight and credibility.

       It is impossible to exaggerate how essential the proper exercise of the fact-finding authority of the Industrial Commission is to the due administration of the act. The findings of fact of the Industrial Commission should tell the full story of the event giving rise to the claim for compensation. They must be sufficiently positive and specific to enable the court on appeal to determine whether they are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been properly applied to them. It is obvious that the court cannot ascertain whether the findings of fact are supported by the evidence unless the Industrial Commission reveals with at least a fair degree of positiveness what facts it finds. It is likewise plain that the court cannot decide whether the conclusions of laws and the decision of the Industrial Commission rightly recognize and effectively enforce the rights of the parties upon the matters in controversy if the Industrial Commission fails to make specific findings as to each material fact upon which those rights depend.

       The North Carolina Industrial Commission erred in finding that an employee was entitled to a presumption of disability due to the employer and its carrier failing to accept or deny the claim within the time period after filing a Form 63, because the commission improperly shifted to the employer the burden of proving that suitable jobs were available to the employee; since the burden remained on the employee to prove his disability, the commission was obligated to make specific findings as to the existence and extent of any disability, and since evidence was presented that the employee was still able to perform some jobs, the commission’s findings were inadequate to establish that the employee was disabled because of pain.

       North Carolina Industrial Commission had to modify a finding of fact and conclusion of law because the finding was simply a recitation of the evidence and did not constitute a finding of fact sufficient to comply with the Workers’ Compensation Act; the Commission had to explain its finding of no permanent impairment, given the nearly eight years of treatment between a doctor’s medical opinion and the date when the condition was found compensable.

       Where an employee worked as a teacher and sought workers’ compensation benefits, arguing that the employee’s generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was an occupational disease caused by a hostile and abusive classroom environment, the North Carolina Industrial Commission properly concluded that the employee’s GAD was not an occupational disease because, although it was inappropriate to imply that the employee’s fault played a role in determining compensability, the employee failed to prove either that the employee’s work increased the risk of GAD or significantly contributed to it, and the Commission did not ignore the testimony of the employee’s expert.

The request shall be passed upon and granted or denied by a member of the Commission or deputy commissioner within 20 days from receipt of the affidavit.

        An appeal of an award of the Industrial Commission does not suspend that agency’s authority to accept notification of an employee’s decision to select his own doctor; neither does an appeal deprive the Commission of its jurisdiction to accept the submission of a claim. It may well be that the determination of the particular claim will be delayed until the outcome of the appeal. Nevertheless, the Commission has jurisdiction to receive the claim and is, in fact, the only agency vested with that jurisdiction. Schofield v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,

        Where appellant on appeal to the superior court (now the Court of Appeals) does not except to any finding of the Industrial Commission or to the award, but merely gives notice of appeal for review as to errors of law, the single question presented to the court is whether the facts found were sufficient to support the award.

        The Industrial Commission’s credibility determinations made in response to Sanders v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., 124 N.C. App. 637, 478 S.E.2d 223 cannot be the Court of Appeals’ basis for reversing the commission’s order absent other error; in other words, if the commission’s conclusions are otherwise supported by competent evidence, the court may not scrutinize the commission’s reasons for believing a witness while engaged in its fact-finding role and overturn its decision on the basis of those reasons.

        Where, upon an appeal from the Industrial Commission, the exceptions point out specific assignments of error, the judgment in the superior court (now the Court of Appeals) thereon properly should overrule or sustain respectively each of the exceptions on matters of law thus designated.

        The Commission’s jurisdiction may be questioned at any stage and even where an appeal, by stipulation, raises only the question of who was claimant’s employer. If the record fails to show by testimony or admission that appellant had the requisite number of employees, the Commission is not shown to have acquired jurisdiction. The making of a stipulation that there was only one question at issue would not serve as an admission of the jurisdictional fact. Chadwick v. North Carolina Dep't of Conservation &amp; Dev.,

        Where the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission to hear and consider a claim for compensation is challenged by an employer on the ground that he is not subject to the provisions of the act, the findings of fact made by the Commission, on which its jurisdiction is dependent, are not conclusive on the superior court (now the Court of Appeals). The court has both the power and the duty, on the appeal of either party to the proceeding, to consider all the evidence in the record, and to find therefrom the jurisdictional facts, without regard to the finding of such facts by the Commission.

        When the assignments of error bring up for review the findings of fact of the Commission, the court will review the evidence to determine as a matter of law whether there is any competent evidence tending to support the findings; if so, the findings of fact are conclusive on the court.

        When the party aggrieved appeals to court from a decision of the full Commission on the theory that the underlying findings of fact of the full Commission are not supported by competent evidence, the court does not retry the facts. The court merely determines from the proceedings had before the Commission whether there was sufficient competent evidence before the Commission to support the findings of fact of the full Commission.

        By authority of this section the Commission is the sole judge of the credibility and weight to be accorded to the evidence and testimony before it. Its findings of fact may be set aside on appeal only when there is a complete lack of competent evidence to support them. Mayo v. City of Washington, 51 N.C. App. 402, 276 S.E.2d 747,
        <cite class="nc_code">

        The Commission is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. Thus, the Commission may assign more weight and credibility to certain testimony than to other testimony. Moreover, if the evidence before the Commission is capable of supporting two contrary findings, the determination of the Commission is conclusive on appeal. Dolbow v. Holland Indus., Inc., 64 N.C. App. 695, 308 S.E.2d 335,

       <p>
        Argument that finding was contrary to the greater weight of the evidence was irrelevant; determining the weight and credibility of evidence was the province of the commission, the fact finder, which could accept or reject different parts of a witness’ testimony as it saw fit.

       In a third-party administrator’s appeal of an opinion and award of the North Carolina Industrial Commission, an order requiring the third-party administrator to reimburse the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier for underpayments and compensation paid to a claimant was upheld as G.S. 97-86.1(d) provided the Commission with the authority to order the payment. The payment of compensation to the claimant, pursuant to Form 60, was not a final award of the Commission and was subject to amendment, including the ordered reimbursement that was made. Starr v.

       An order directing defendants to forthwith comply with the opinion and award has the import of an affirmance under this section. A contrary holding would permit circumvention of the compensation statutes by appeals taken but subsequently abandoned upon calendaring for review; carriers, through frivolous appeals, could temporarily deprive injured employees of awards while retaining the earnings thereon. The General Assembly, in the enactment of this section, did not intend to permit such a result. Suggs v. Kelly Springfield Tire Co., 71 N.C. App. 428, 322 S.E.2d 441,

       Because the only argument made before the North Carolina Industrial Commission was that an employee’s claim should be denied because the employee did not know the cause of the employee’s fall, an argument that had been rejected in controlling precedent, the denial of the employee’s claim and the decision to pursue the action was unreasonable; thus, the Commission did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the employee.

       North Carolina Industrial Commission erred in finding that the employer’s defense of a claim for ongoing temporary disability compensation was reasonable and in declining to award attorney’s fees as the evidence introduced at the hearing confirmed that the employer intentionally disregarded information identifying four clearly compensable work-related injuries sustained by the claimant and that the denial of compensation was not based on any mistaken opinion held by the adjuster, who made no effort to confirm the claimant’s report of an injury. While it was reasonable for an employer with a legitimate doubt regarding the employee’s credibility to defend a hearing based on substantial evidence of conduct by the employee inconsistent with his alleged claim, the overwhelming evidence in the case left no room for any legitimate doubt; rather, the employer’s intentional disregard of information indisputably known to it in the matter and its affirmative failure to investigate obvious avenues that would have clarified the events of the injuries were not reasonable.

       There is no indication that the Industrial Commission intended to modify the deputy commissioner’s approval of attorney’s fees to the employee’s counsel where the lack of findings in the opinion and award to justify a denial of attorneys fees was contrary to the contention of the employer and its insurer and the Commission’s assumption that the Commission in 2008 intended to deny the fee request.

        Employee Paid in Part by State. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant was paid for janitorial work partly by the local board of education and partly by the State School Commission. He was injured while doing extra, after-hours work solely for and at the expense of the board. A stipulation in the insurance contract with the board reduced the carrier’s liability where part of the employee’s wage was paid by the State. This clause was held inapplicable to the instant case, since pay for the job in which he was injured was not shared by the State, even though the award was figured on the basis of his regular weekly wage which the State did share.

       Where a policy covered a Charlotte employer, inter alia, on “operations . . . conducted . . . from” its main place of business, it was proper for the Commission to find that an employee going daily to lay tile nearby in South Carolina, who was expected to report back at headquarters each evening and was killed in North Carolina on such return journey, was within the policy, even though the tile company had a policy in another company covering its operations in South Carolina and the North Carolina carrier did not receive any premium for the South Carolina job.

       A policy designated the operations of the insured as “concrete products mfg. — shop or yard work only,” and gave as the location the address of the main plant of the insured. The policy covered injuries sustained by reason of the business operations, which were stated to include “all operations necessary, incident or appurtenant thereto . . . whether such operations are conducted at the work places defined . . . or elsewhere.” The policy further provided that no other business operations were covered. An injury received at defendant’s quarry, 40 miles from the main plant, was held to be covered by this policy; it was “one of the work places of the company.” Williams v. Ornamental Stone Co.,

       Defendant carrier’s policy covered defendant trucker’s employees, including specifically blacksmiths, and service away from the business headquarters. The employer not only hauled stone for others but, without disclosure to the carrier, operated a quarry from which he sold and delivered stone. Deceased employee, a blacksmith, worked at the quarry only, but repaired some shovels and other tools used in connection with the trucking as well as the quarry machinery. He was on the general payroll. The policy provided for adjustment of the premiums on a payroll check-over made at the end of the policy period. It was held that the Commission’s findings that the quarrying operations were carried on in connection with the trucking business and that the employee was covered by the policy were supported by competent evidence and were binding on the court. An award against the carrier was upheld. Miller v. Caudle,

The appellate court could not interpret a workers’ compensation statute in a manner contrary to its plain and unambiguous language, even if this interpretation barred recovery by the employees, who had no other recourse due to the employer’s bankruptcy.

       In two workers’ compensation cases relating to exposure to asbestos, employees did not have “covered claims” because their last injurious exposure to asbestos occurred before an insolvent employer was a member of the North Carolina Self-Insurance Security Association. The appellate court could not interpret a workers’ compensation statute in a manner contrary to its plain and unambiguous language, even if this interpretation barred recovery by the employees, who had no other recourse due to the employer’s bankruptcy.
