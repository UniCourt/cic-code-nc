       Although this Chapter does not expressly exempt from its provisions one who purchases or leases land for his own account, it defines “real estate broker” as a person who does these specified acts “for others.” McArver v.

The Commission may investigate the moral character and fitness, including the mental and emotional fitness, of each applicant for licensure as the applicant’s character and fitness may generally relate to the real estate brokerage business, the public interest, and the public’s confidence in the real estate brokerage business. The Commission may also require an applicant to provide the Commission with a criminal record report. All applicants shall obtain criminal record reports from one or more reporting services designated by the Commission to provide criminal record reports.

       All licenses issued by the Commission under the provisions of this Chapter shall expire on the 30th day of June following issuance or on any other date that the Commission may determine and shall become invalid after that date unless reinstated. A license may be renewed 45 days prior to the expiration date by filing an application with and paying to the Executive Director of the Commission the license renewal fee. The license renewal fee shall be forty-five dollars ($45.00) unless the Commission sets the fee at a higher amount by rule; however, the Commission shall not set the license renewal fee at an amount that exceeds sixty dollars ($60.00). The license renewal fee may not increase by more than five dollars ($5.00) during a 12-month period. The Commission may adopt rules establishing a system of license renewal in which the licenses expire annually with varying expiration dates. These rules shall provide for prorating the annual fee to cover the initial renewal period so that no licensee shall be charged an amount greater than the annual fee for any 12-month period. The fee for reinstatement of an expired, revoked, or suspended license shall be an amount equal to two times the license renewal fee at the time the application for reinstatement is submitted. In the event a licensee fails to obtain a reinstatement of such license within six months after the expiration date thereof, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider such person as not having been previously licensed, and thereby subject to the provisions of this Chapter relating to the issuance of an original license, including the examination requirements set forth herein. Duplicate licenses may be issued by the Commission upon payment of a fee of five dollars ($5.00) by the licensee. Commission certification of a licensee’s license history shall be made only after the payment of a fee of ten dollars ($10.00).

       Finding by the Real Estate Licensing Board that “there is substantial evidence” that a real estate agent acted in violation of subdivision (a)(8) of this section in certain respects is insufficient to support a suspension of the agent’s license since it is necessary for the Board to find that the agent “is deemed guilty of ” a violation of the statute before his license can be suspended.

       Evidence offered by the Board to the effect that a real estate broker had pleaded guilty to a charge of operating a disorderly house shows acts of a vile and decadent character committed by him, but such acts are not connected in any way with the pursuit of his licensed privilege as a real estate broker, and are not a ground for revocation of his license, and such evidence was correctly excluded as irrelevant and immaterial under former version of this section.

The fund shall be used in the manner provided under this Article for the payment of unsatisfied judgments where the aggrieved person has suffered a direct monetary loss by reason of certain acts committed by any real estate broker. The Commission may also expend money from the fund to create books and other publications, courses, forms, seminars, and other programs and materials to educate licensees and the public in real estate subjects. However, the Commission shall make no expenditures from the fund for educational purposes if the expenditure will reduce the balance of the fund to an amount less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000).

Thereafter, the Commission may transfer to the Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund additional sums of money from whatever funds the Commission may have, provided that, if on December 31 of any year the amount remaining in the fund is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the Commission may determine that each person or entity licensed under this Chapter, when renewing a license, shall pay in addition to the license renewal fee, a fee not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per broker  as shall be determined by the Commission for the purpose of replenishing the fund.

The Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an incomplete application, notify the developer by mail that the Commission has found specified deficiencies, and shall, within 60 days after the receipt of a properly completed application, either issue the certificate of registration or notify the developer by mail or by electronic means of any specific objections to the registration of the program. Once issued, the certificate shall be available for inspection upon request of the Commission, and a copy of the certificate shall be available for inspection by written request from any purchaser or owner.

If a developer disposes of, or otherwise terminates its interest in a timeshare program, the developer shall cease all marketing and sales of timeshares, certify to the Commission in writing that its interest in the timeshare program is terminated, and shall return to the Commission for cancellation the certificate of registration.

In all proceedings to deny a certificate of registration, the provisions of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes shall be applicable.

       All certificates of registration granted and issued by the Commission under the provisions of this Article shall expire on the 30th day of June following issuance thereof, and shall become invalid after that date unless reinstated. A certificate may be renewed 45 days prior to the expiration date by filing an application with and paying to the Commission the timeshare registration renewal fee fixed by the Commission but not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for each timeshare program. Each certificate reinstated after the expiration date thereof shall be subject to a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to the required renewal fee. If a developer fails to reinstate the registration within 12 months after the expiration date thereof, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider the timeshare program as not having been previously registered, and thereby subject to the provisions of this Article relating to the issuance of an original certificate. Duplicate certificates may be issued by the Commission upon payment of a fee of one dollar ($1.00) by the registrant developer. Except as prescribed by Commission rules, all fees paid pursuant to this Article shall be nonrefundable.

       The managing entity may not furnish the name, address, electronic mail address, or contact information of any owner to any person, including any other owner or authorized agent of an owner, unless the owner whose name, address, electronic mail address, or contact information is requested first approves the disclosure in writing. The managing entity shall maintain among its records and provide to the Commission upon request a complete list of the names and addresses of all owners in the timeshare program. The managing entity shall update this list at least quarterly. The managing entity may not publish this owners’ list or provide a copy of it to any owner or to any third party other than the Commission. However, the managing entity shall mail to those owners listed on the owners’ list materials provided by any owner, upon the written request of that owner, if the purpose of the mailing is to advance legitimate business of the timeshare program, including, but not limited to, a proxy solicitation for any purpose, including the recall of one or more directors elected by the owners or the discharge of the management firm. The managing entity shall be responsible for determining the appropriateness of any requested mailing. The owner who requests the mailing must reimburse the managing entity in advance for the actual, reasonable costs in performing the mailing. A mailing requested for the purpose of advancing legitimate business of the timeshare program shall occur within 30 days after receipt of a request from an owner.

The managing entity shall not be liable to any person for any inaccuracy in the books and records arising from the failure of the predecessor in interest to timely and correctly notify the managing entity of the name and mailing address of the successor in interest.

       The managing entity shall make the books and records reasonably available for inspection by any owner or the authorized agent of an owner. The managing entity may charge the owner a reasonable fee for copying or providing the requested information; however, any owner or agent of an owner shall be permitted to personally inspect and examine the books and records wherever located at any reasonable time, under reasonable conditions, and under the supervision of the custodian of those records. All books and financial records of the timeshare program must be maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices. The managing entity may require any owner or authorized agent of an owner to execute and provide a reasonable confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement prohibiting the disclosure of books and records to nonowners.

An officer, director, or agent of a timeshare owners’ association shall be exempt from liability for monetary damages unless the officer, director, or agent breached or failed to perform their duties and the breach of, or failure to perform, those duties constitutes a violation of criminal law, constitutes a transaction from which the officer, director, or agent derived an improper personal benefit, either directly or indirectly, or constitutes recklessness or an act or omission that was in bad faith, with malicious purpose, or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.

       Delinquent assessments may bear interest at the highest rate permitted by law or at some lesser rate established by the managing entity. In addition to interest, the managing entity may charge a reasonable administrative late fee for each delinquent assessment. Any costs of collection, including reasonable collection agency fees and reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in the collection of a delinquent assessment shall be paid by the owner and shall be secured by a lien in favor of the managing entity upon the timeshare with respect to which the delinquent assessment has been incurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1b">
       The managing entity may deny the use of the timeshare units or facilities, including the denial of the right to make a reservation or the cancellation of a confirmed reservation for timeshare periods, to any owner who is delinquent in the payment of any assessments made by the managing entity against the owner for common expenses, in accordance with the following:

        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1b1">
         The managing entity must, no less than 30 days after the date the assessment is due, notify the owner in writing of the total amount of any delinquency which then exists, including any accrued interest and late charges permitted to be imposed under the terms of the timeshare program or by law and including a per diem amount. The notice shall be sent to the owner at the owner’s known address as recorded in the books and records of the timeshare program.
        </li>
        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1b2">
         The notice shall clearly state that the owner will not be permitted to use the owner’s timeshare, that the owner will not be permitted to make a reservation in the timeshare program’s reservation system, or that any confirmed reservation may be canceled until the total amount of such delinquency is satisfied in full or until the owner produces satisfactory evidence that the delinquency does not exist.

         Any costs reasonably incurred by the managing entity in connection with its compliance with the requirements of this section may be assessed by the managing entity against the delinquent owner and collected in the same manner as if those costs were common expenses of the timeshare program allocable solely to the delinquent purchaser.

        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1c1">

        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1c2">
         The notice shall state that unless the owner satisfies the delinquency in full, or unless the owner produces satisfactory evidence that the delinquency does not exist, the purchaser will be bound by the terms of any rental contract entered into by the managing entity with respect to the owner’s timeshare or appurtenant use rights.
        </li>
        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1c3">

        </li>
        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1c7">
         In securing a rental, the managing entity shall not be required to obtain the highest nightly rental rate available, nor any particular rental rate, and the managing entity shall not be required to rent the entire timeshare or appurtenant rights; however, the managing entity must use reasonable efforts to secure a rental that is commensurate with other rentals of similar timeshares or use rights generally secured at that time.

         The managing entity, or the holder of the lien, may bring a judicial action in its name to foreclose the lien in the nature of an action to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust and may also bring an action to recover a money judgment for the unpaid assessments without waiving any claim of lien. As an alternative to initiating a judicial action, the managing entity may initiate a nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding to foreclose the assessment lien.
        </li>
        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1d2">
         The lien is effective from the date of and shall relate back to the recording of the original timeshare declaration, or, in the case of lien on a timeshare located in a phase timeshare program, the last to occur of the recording of the original timeshare declaration or amendment creating the timeshare. However, as to first mortgages of record, the lien is effective from and after filing of the claim of lien in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the timeshare estate is located.
        </li>
        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1d3">
         The claim of lien shall state the name of the timeshare program and identify the timeshare for which the lien is effective, state the name of the owner, state the assessment amount due, and state the due dates. The claim of lien shall be signed and acknowledged by an officer or agent of the managing entity or the holder.

        <li id="t93Aa04s93A-62ol1d5">
         A claim of lien for assessments may include assessments which are due when the claim is recorded and all assessments that subsequently become due and are delinquent. Upon full payment, the person making the payment is entitled to receive a satisfaction of the lien.

      Session Laws 1989, c. 563, through the enactment of Article 5, gave the Real Estate Commission authority to license and certify appraisers, with the Appraisal Board created within the Commission as an advisory board. The article was originally enacted as G.S. 93A-60 to 93A-71, but was renumbered as G.S. 93A-70 to 93A-81 at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes. Session Laws 1993, c. 419, s. 7 repealed Article 5 effective July 1, 1994. Section 6 of Session Laws 1993, c. 419, also effective July 1, 1994, enacted the North Carolina Appraisers Act, G.S. 93E-1-1 et seq., which created the North Carolina Appraisal Board as an independent body.
