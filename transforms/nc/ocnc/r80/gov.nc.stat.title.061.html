     Immunity. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Plaintiffs sought several nonmonetary remedies, including the voiding of transfers of the church’s property and imposition of a constructive trust, and even if the statute applied, it would operate as a limitation on recovery, not as a ground for dismissal altogether, plus the alleged conduct of fraud might meet one or more of the exceptions in the statute to immunity; dismissal was not required. McKnight ex rel. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church v. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., 2021 NCBC 35, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 54 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2021).

    <b>
     Society Entitled to Remove Trustee Who Is Faithless to Trust. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the provisions of this section, a religious society may remove a trustee of church property who proves faithless to his trust and may fill any vacancy thus created. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 231</cite>, 23 S.E. 178, 1895 N.C. LEXIS 50 (1895).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Individual Liability Erroneously Assessed. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    When church officials sued seceders from the church to recover church property, the trial court erroneously found the seceders individually liable because, under G.S. 61-1(b), they were immune from individual liability, as they were acting on behalf of a religious society. Daniel v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 580 S.E.2d 711, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1038 (2003).
   </p>
   <p>
    Faithlessness is not required, however, and a religious society may remove trustees at will.
   
   North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617, 1911 N.C. LEXIS 212 (1911).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Effect of Church Regulations. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    A church has authority to appoint a “suitable number” of its own trustees for the purpose of acquiring and holding church property, and remove them at will; furthermore, where the discipline of the denomination with which a church is affiliated has provided a note to be given for the trial of “offenses,” this regulation refers to infractions of church discipline and does not apply to the election or removal of trustees. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617, 1911 N.C. LEXIS 212 (1911).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Right of Competent Trustee to Maintain Action for Removal of Trustees, etc. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    A duly appointed trustee of a religious society may maintain an action for the removal of faithless or incompetent trustees, and compel them to convey the property held by them to the purposes for which it was designed, and such trustee may also maintain an action to set up a lost deed executed for the benefit of the cestui que trust. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 550</cite>, 14 S.E. 77, 1891 N.C. LEXIS 264 (1891).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Right of Member to Sue. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    In the absence of a competent trustee and a governing body authorized to appoint trustees, any member of a religious society has such a beneficial interest as will enable him, in behalf of fellow members, to maintain such action as may be necessary to protect their common interest. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 550</cite>, 14 S.E. 77, 1891 N.C. LEXIS 264 (1891).
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     No Pre-Suit Demand Required. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Defendants argued that plaintiffs were required to make a pre-suit demand just as a shareholder had to before bringing a derivative suit on behalf of a corporation, but defendants have not cited any authority for that proposition, the chapter contained no such requirement, and North Carolina appellate courts have never imposed one. McKnight ex rel. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church v. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., 2021 NCBC 35, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 54 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2021).

     No General Capacity of Acquisition. —

   </p>
   <p>
    Religious societies or their trustees have no general capacity of acquisition; they can only take for the use of the society. And by a conveyance to trustees, for purposes forbidden by the policy of the law, nothing passes. Trustees of Quaker Soc'y of Contentnea v. Dickenson, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. 189</cite>, 1827 N.C. LEXIS 32 (1827).

     Right of Church to Use Property. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    A church of the congregational system, having elected certain trustees to supercede several trustees theretofore elected, holds the church property through those trustees later elected and has the right to the use of the church for religious services without molestation from the trustees who were removed or from its conference. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617, 1911 N.C. LEXIS 212 (1911).
   </p>
   <p>
    A church is not required to be incorporated to be able to hold property;
   
   therefore, revocation of the corporate charter of the United Church of God was irrelevant to determining whether the United Church of God, Inc. had the right to control the property of its alleged local affiliate, St. Luke United Church of God of America. United Church of God, Inc. v. McLendon, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 344 S.E.2d 373, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2318 (1986).

    An individual member of a religious society has an equitable interest in the property
   
   held by the society. Nash v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 231</cite>, 23 S.E. 178, 1895 N.C. LEXIS 50 (1895).

    <b>
     Trusts for Special Purposes. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    There is nothing in this section which precludes trustees of a certain North Carolina church from accepting trusts for special purposes; and, even if there were, a trust for a special purpose would not fail because they were named as trustees, but equity would appoint other trustees to administer it in application of the maxim that a trust will not be allowed to fail for lack of a trustee. King v. Richardson, 46 F. Supp. 510, 1942 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2570 (D.N.C. 1942), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 136 F.2d 849, 1943 U.S. App. LEXIS 3152 (4th Cir. 1943).

   <p>
    The trustees of a church are merely agents and have no property interest
   
   as against the governing body of the church. North Carolina Christian Conference v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. 524</cite>, 72 S.E. 617, 1911 N.C. LEXIS 212 (1911).

     Standing. —

   </p>
   <p>
    Plaintiffs were required only to make an affirmative averment showing their capacity and authority to sue, and having done so by alleging they were trustees of the church, the court took the verified allegations as true at this stage. McKnight ex rel. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church v. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., 2021 NCBC 35, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 54 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2021).
   </p>
   <p>
    As trustees, plaintiffs could assert claims based on the property they held in trust for the church, but this did not include the allegations related to the termination of the senior pastor’s employment contract; even as trustees, plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue claims based on those allegations, and the court dismissed the claims to that extent. McKnight ex rel. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church v. Wakefield Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., 2021 NCBC 35, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 54 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2021).

    Congregation taking possession of a church cannot contest validity of a mortgage given by the trustees
   
   for the purchase money on the ground that it was ultra vires. Rountree v. Blount, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 25</cite>, 39 S.E. 631, 1901 N.C. LEXIS 8 (1901).

   <p>
    <b>
     Recovery of Property by Trustees. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The title to church property is vested in the trustees individually and they may recover at law, though in the writ and declaration they style themselves “trustees.” Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite>, 1846 N.C. LEXIS 12 (1846).
   </p>
   <p>
    Trustees of a church allegedly merged into a successor had standing to bring a quiet title suit against the successor because the trustees’ assertion of property rights on behalf of a non-incorporated religious organization only depended on the successor’s failure to obtain the consent of all trustees to transfer church property. Burns v. Kingdom Impact Global Ministries, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 797 S.E.2d 21, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 38 (2017).

    In a contest between two committees, each claiming to be the rightful board of trustees to hold the same title in trust for the same beneficial owner, the title did not come into controversy. Thornton v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 498</cite>, 53 S.E. 341, 1906 N.C. LEXIS 33 (1906).

     Right of Original Trustees to Sue Though Not Legally Appointed. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Where a conveyance was made to three persons for a certain tract of land as trustees for a church, a suit of trespass could be brought by them against the wrongdoers, even though they could not be appointed trustees according to law. Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite>, 1846 N.C. LEXIS 12 (1846).
   </p>
   <p>
    It is only when a suit is brought by persons who claim as “successors” that a question arises as to whether the original bargainees were duly chosen the trustees of a religious congregation, and whether the persons suing were also duly chosen trustees, so as to give them legally the character of “successors” to the former, and thereby vest in them the title to the property which is necessary to support an action. Walker v. Fawcett, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 44</cite>, 1846 N.C. LEXIS 12 (1846).

    Trial court erred in dismissing the complaint brought by a group of church members against the pastor and various church officers due to the church members’ failure to have named the church as a defendant, because the cause of action, which alleged civil conversion, various conspiracy charges, breach of the church’s constitution and by-laws as well as breach of fiduciary duty, was really a derivative action in that the church members alleged that the church was unincorporated and, therefore, the church members were really suing on behalf of the church; the dispute arose from alleged missing church funds and the allegation that the church officers were permitting the pastor to remain at the church and receive his salary against the majority vote of the congregation.
