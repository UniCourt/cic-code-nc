       An action to declare void a marriage of a person incapable of contracting for want of understanding may be instituted in the lifetime of the parties thereto by a guardian for the alleged mentally incompetent person or by such mentally incompetent person if and when he or she becomes mentally competent to do so; and unless such marriage is followed by cohabitation and the birth of issue, such action may be instituted after the death of such mentally incompetent person by a person or persons whose legal rights depend upon whether such marriage is valid or void.

    Grounds for absolute divorce in cases of incurable insanity.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In all cases where a husband and wife have lived separate and apart for three consecutive years, without cohabitation, and are still so living separate and apart by reason of the incurable insanity of one of them, the court may grant a decree of absolute divorce upon the petition of the sane spouse: Provided, if the insane spouse has been released on a trial basis to the custody of his or her respective spouse such shall not be considered as terminating the status of living “separate and apart” nor shall it be considered as constituting “cohabitation” for the purpose of this section nor shall it prevent the granting of a divorce as provided by this section. Provided further, the evidence shall show that the insane spouse is suffering from incurable insanity, and has been confined or examined for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered or, if not so confined, has been examined at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce and then found to be incurably insane as hereinafter provided. Provided further, that proof of incurable insanity be supported by the testimony of two reputable physicians, one of whom shall be a staff member or the superintendent of the institution where the insane spouse is confined, and one regularly practicing physician in the community wherein such husband and wife reside, who has no connection with the institution in which said insane spouse is confined; and provided further that a sworn statement signed by said staff member or said superintendent of the institution wherein the insane spouse is confined or was examined shall be admissible as evidence of the facts and opinions therein stated as to the mental status of said insane spouse and as to whether or not said insane spouse is suffering from incurable insanity, or the parties according to the laws governing depositions may take the deposition of said staff member or superintendent of the institution wherein the insane spouse is confined; and provided further that incurable insanity may be proved by the testimony of one or more licensed physicians who are members of the staff of one of this State’s accredited four-year medical schools or a state-supported mental institution, supported by the testimony of one or more other physicians licensed by the State of North Carolina, that each of them examined the allegedly incurable insane spouse at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce and then determined that said spouse was suffering from incurable insanity and that one or more of them examined the allegedly insane spouse subsequent to the institution of the action and that in his or their opinion the said allegedly insane spouse was continuously incurably insane throughout the full period of three years prior to the institution of the said action.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of proof of incurable insanity and confinement for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered prescribed in the preceding paragraph, it shall be sufficient if the evidence shall show that the allegedly insane spouse was adjudicated to be insane more than three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce, that such insanity has continued without interruption since such adjudication and that such person has not been adjudicated to be sane since such adjudication of insanity; provided, further, proof of incurable insanity existing after the institution of the action for divorce shall be furnished by the testimony of two reputable, regularly practicing physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of proof of incurable insanity and confinement for three consecutive years next preceding the bringing of the action in an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered, or the adjudication of insanity, as prescribed in the preceding paragraphs, it shall be sufficient if the evidence shall show that the insane spouse was examined by two or more members of the staff of one of this State’s accredited four-year medical schools, both of whom are medical doctors, at least three years preceding the institution of the action for divorce with a determination at that time by said staff members that said spouse is suffering from incurable insanity, that such insanity has continued without interruption since such determination; provided, further, that sworn statements signed by the staff members of the accredited medical school who examined the insane spouse at least three years preceding the commencement of the action shall be admissible as evidence of the facts and opinions therein stated as to the mental status of said insane spouse as to whether or not said insane spouse was suffering from incurable insanity; provided, further, that proof of incurable insanity under this section existing after the institution of the action for divorce shall be furnished by the testimony of two reputable physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist on the staff of one of the State’s accredited four-year medical schools, and one a physician practicing regularly in the community wherein such insane person resides.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all decrees granted under this subdivision in actions in which the insane defendant has insufficient income and property to provide for his or her own care and maintenance, the court shall require the plaintiff to provide for the care and maintenance of the insane defendant for the defendant’s lifetime, based upon the standards set out in G.S. 50-16.5(a). The trial court will retain jurisdiction of the parties and the cause, from term to term, for the purpose of making such orders as equity may require to enforce the provisions of the decree requiring plaintiff to furnish the necessary funds for such care and maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service of process shall be held upon the regular guardian for said defendant spouse, if any, and if no regular guardian, upon a duly appointed guardian ad litem and also upon the superintendent or physician in charge of the institution wherein the insane spouse is confined. Such guardian or guardian ad litem shall make an investigation of the circumstances and notify the next of kin of the insane spouse or the superintendent of the institution of the action and whenever practical confer with said next of kin before filing appropriate pleadings in behalf of the defendant.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all actions brought under this subdivision, if the jury finds as a fact that the plaintiff has been guilty of such conduct as has conduced to the unsoundness of mind of the insane defendant, the relief prayed for shall be denied.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plaintiff or defendant must have resided in this State for six months next preceding institution of any action under this section.

       The purpose of former G.S. 50-5(6), as amended (recodified as this section) is to require that a person alleged to be incurably insane shall not have his or her marital status altered until such person has been committed to an institution for the care and treatment of the mentally disordered for a period of five (now three) successive years in order that it may be ascertained whether or not the inmate’s insanity is incurable. Mere confinement for a period of five (now three) successive years in such an institution would fulfill the literal meaning of the statute but it would not be in compliance with its spirit or purpose.

       In a proceeding by wife for divorce on the ground of husband’s insanity, where doctors testified that the husband was incurably insane, the fact that the husband during the five-year (now three-year) period of confinement had been released on probation to his relatives on separate occasions, once for 10 days and once for six months, did not bar divorce of wife on the ground of insanity, since release on probation did not constitute such acts on the part of the hospital authorities as to terminate the period of confinement within the meaning of former G.S. 50-5(6) (recodified as this section).

       In a suit for divorce on the statutory ground of insanity, the insanity must be the reason for the separation of the parties, but no greater proof of separation and its continuance during the five-year (now three-year) period is required than in a proceeding for divorce based on a two-year (now one-year) separation period.

       Separation occasioned by insanity is cause for divorce in North Carolina only in cases of incurable insanity. And in these cases the requirements of this section must be met. In all other instances of separation arising by reason of mental incompetency, such separation is not a ground for divorce.

      Marriages may be dissolved and the parties thereto divorced from the bonds of matrimony on the application of either party, if and when the husband and wife have lived separate and apart for one year, and the plaintiff or defendant in the suit for divorce has resided in the State for a period of six months. A divorce under this section shall not be barred to either party by any defense or plea based upon any provision of G.S. 50-7, a plea of res judicata, or a plea of recrimination.

     <p>
      Whether there has been a resumption of marital relations during the period of separation shall be determined pursuant to G.S. 52-10.2. Isolated incidents of sexual intercourse between the parties shall not toll the statutory period required for divorce predicated on separation of one year.

However, the cause of action continues to accrue even after the one year period, so long as the parties remain “separate and apart” within the meaning of the statute. Bruce v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 339 S.E.2d 855, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2097 (1986).

        The only persons who may bring an action for absolute divorce are those persons who are lawfully married to one another. Where there are children born to a marriage, it is neither proper nor necessary for them to be made parties to an action for divorce between their parents. Likewise, the only necessary parties in an action to set aside an absolute divorce decree after one spouse’s death are the surviving spouse and the personal representative of the deceased spouse.

        The application to divorces under this section of the G.S. 50-10 requirement that the factual allegations supporting the divorce must be deemed denied requires a finding of the necessary facts. While it remains sound public policy not to allow the granting of such divorces on the pleadings, it would, nevertheless, appear that it would make good jurisprudential sense to clearly remove divorces under this section from the more cumbersome jury procedure and provide that all such cases be heard by the judge without a jury.

        A legal separation for the requisite period of two years (now one year) is ground for divorce under this section. The separation here contemplated includes a “judicial separation” as well as one brought about by the act of the parties, or one of them. Lockhart v.

        The effect of a judgment granting a divorce a mensa et thoro was to legalize the separation of the parties which theretofore had been caused by the husband’s actions, and after two years (now one year) from the date of such judgment, the husband could proceed to an absolute divorce.

        The effect of a divorce a mensa et thoro obtained by the wife on the ground that her husband abandoned her, was to legalize their separation from the date of such judgment; and in such case the husband, after two years (now one year) from the date of such judgment, could proceed to an absolute divorce.

       <p>
        A judgment in an action instituted under former G.S. 50-16 decreeing that the husband had willfully abandoned the wife and awarding her support and maintenance constituted a judicial separation which, two years (now one year) thereafter, would permit the husband to obtain an absolute divorce.

         Effect of Resumption of Cohabitation upon Separation Agreement. —

       </p>
       <p>
        When separated spouses who have executed a separation agreement resume living together in the home which they occupied before the separation, they hold themselves out as man and wife in the ordinary acceptation of the descriptive phrase. Irrespective of whether they have resumed sexual relations, in contemplation of law, their action amounts to a resumption of marital cohabitation which rescinds their separation agreement insofar as it had not been executed. Further, a subsequent separation will not revive the agreement. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541, 1976 N.C. LEXIS 998 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The same public policy which will not permit spouses to continue to live together in the same home, holding themselves out to the public as husband and wife, to sue each other for an absolute divorce on the ground of separation, or to base the period of separation required for a divorce on any time they live together, will also nullify a separation agreement if the parties resume marital cohabitation. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541, 1976 N.C. LEXIS 998 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The heart of a separation agreement is the parties’ intention and agreement to live separate and apart forever, and when a husband and wife enter into a deed of separation the policy of the law is that they are to live separate. Therefore, they void the separation agreement if they reestablish a matrimonial home. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541, 1976 N.C. LEXIS 998 (1976).

       <p>
        If a separation is legalized by an award of alimony without divorce, there is no sound reason why it should not also be legalized by a decree denying alimony based upon a finding of no dependency. In each case the court has considered and determined the respective rights and obligations of the separated parties insofar as support is concerned. In neither case is the court able to mend the broken marriage or to force the parties to live together if either persists in continuing to live apart. Cook v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The separation of the parties became legalized by the entry of the judgment which denied defendant alimony and by entry of the order which awarded her possession of the house. The parties having lived separate and apart for more than one year after their separation thus became legalized, plaintiff was entitled to maintain an action for an absolute divorce under this section. The adjudication made in the prior action that plaintiff had originally wrongfully abandoned the defendant was not effective as a bar in the later action. Cook v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

It must appear that the separation is with that definite purpose on the part of at least one of the parties.

       <p>
        Where a husband and wife are living together and their children are in their joint custody and are being adequately supported by the supporting spouse, in the absence of allegations which would support an award of alimony or divorce, one spouse may not maintain an action to evict the other, get sole custody of the children, and obtain an order for child support; therefore, the trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, since the complaint attempted to assert, and the court allowed, what appeared to be a “no fault” divorce from bed and board, and such an action does not lie in this State.

Thus, as she presented no evidence establishing one of the grounds in this section, plaintiff failed to meet her burden of proof as to this issue, and the trial court properly denied her request for a divorce from bed and board.

        In an action for divorce from bed and board under this section, the trial court should make adequate findings of facts (i.e. specific acts of misconduct) to support the conclusion of law that the noninjured party has (1) abandoned the family; (2) maliciously turned the other out of doors; (3) endangered the life of the other by cruel or barbarous treatment; (4) offered such indignities to the person of the other as to render his or her condition intolerable; or (5) become an excessive user of alcohol or drugs so that the other’s life is burdensome.

       <p>
        One spouse abandons the other where he or she brings their cohabitation to an end without justification, without the consent of the other spouse and without intent of renewing it. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 266 S.E.2d 381, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment under this subdivision is not synonymous with the criminal offense defined in G.S. 14-322. In a prosecution under G.S. 14-322, the State must establish (1) a willful abandonment and (2) a willful failure to provide adequate support. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 12, 1966 N.C. LEXIS 1249 (1966).

        Nor is it necessary for the husband himself to depart from his home

        The Supreme Court, in applying the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section, has never undertaken to formulate any all-embracing definition or rule of general application respecting what conduct on the part of one spouse will justify the other in withdrawing from the marital relation, and each case must be determined in large measure upon its own particular circumstances. Ordinarily, however, the withdrawing spouse is not justified in leaving the other unless the conduct of the latter is such as would likely render it impossible for the withdrawing spouse to continue the marital relation with safety, health, and self-respect, and as would constitute ground in itself for divorce at least from bed and board. Caddell v. Caddell, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 686</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 923, 1953 N.C. LEXIS 472 (1953).

         Withdrawal from Home May Be Abandonment Even If Support Is Paid. —

        A husband may be deemed to have abandoned his wife within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section, and so be liable for alimony, notwithstanding the fact that, after cohabitation is brought to an end, he voluntarily provides her with adequate support. Whether his withdrawal from the home, followed by such support, constitutes an abandonment which is ground for suit by the wife for divorce from bed and board, and therefore ground for suit by her for alimony without divorce, depends upon whether his withdrawal from the home was justified by the conduct of the wife. Schloss v. Schloss, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 266</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 5, 1968 N.C. LEXIS 586 (1968) (decided under former G.S. 50-16).
       </p>
       <p>
        A wife is entitled to her husband’s society and the protection of his name and home in cohabitation. The permanent denial of these rights may be aggravated by leaving her destitute or may be mitigated by a liberal provision for her support, but if the cohabitation is brought to an end without justification and without the consent of the wife and without the intention of renewing it, the matrimonial offense of desertion is complete. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 538</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 12, 1966 N.C. LEXIS 1249 (1966); Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C.

        In plaintiff’s action for divorce from bed and board on the ground that defendant had inflicted such indignities upon her as to render her life burdensome, evidence was sufficient to enable the jury to find for plaintiff where it tended to show that at some time prior to 1969 defendant began sleeping and spending the majority of his time in the basement of the parties’ home, isolated from plaintiff; that upon moving into the basement, defendant withdrew from active participation in the resolution of familial and household problems; that defendant viewed hardcore pornographic material in his basement and permitted his minor children to view such material; that during 1973 and 1974 defendant requested that plaintiff indulge him in various unnatural sexual desires; and that subsequent to 1975 defendant was absent from the parties’ home every weekend and all holidays until September 24, 1976, when he left the home for good.

        There is no conflict between the statutes dealing with procedure in divorce actions and G.S. 1A-1, Rule 13(a). Rather, G.S. 1A-1, Rule 13(a) superimposes an additional characteristic on certain kinds of counterclaims. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 172</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 399, 1978 N.C.

       <p>
        This section requires that in all divorce actions the complaint shall set forth the name and age of any minor child or children of the marriage, and that in the event there are no minor children of the marriage, the complaint shall so state. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 202 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">1974 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Allegations of the names and ages of any children of a party seeking divorce in North Carolina are required by this section, in order that the court may protect the interests of such children if the parties have failed to do so. Powers v. Parisher, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 409 S.E.2d 725, <cite class="nc_code">1991 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1050 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The obvious reason for this requirement
   
   is to bring to the attention of the court any minor children that might be affected by the divorce, to the end that the court will protect the interests of those children. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 607, 202 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">1974 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for the requirement of this section for a pleading relating to minor children is not to establish jurisdiction. Cobb v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 373, 256 S.E.2d 722, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2834 (1979).

        Where the complaint in a suit for an absolute divorce alleged facts entitling either or both of the parties to the marriage to an absolute divorce, defendant’s answer admitting these allegations, together with his prayer for an absolute divorce on the same grounds, was in effect a counterclaim seeking affirmative relief and arising out of the same transactions alleged in the complaint.

       <p>
        If a decree of divorce, regular in all respects on the face of the judgment roll, is obtained by false swearing, by way of pleading and of evidence, relating to the cause or ground for divorce, the decree is voidable but not void, and is immune from attack by either party to the divorce.

       <p>
        In an action for annulment of a marriage entered into between plaintiff husband and defendant wife following a decree of divorce in favor of defendant against her former husband, plaintiff, who had been married to defendant for six years, could not attack the divorce decree by alleging false swearing of defendant in regard to the ground or cause for divorce.

        In an action for divorce the affidavit formerly required by this section in connection with the complaint was jurisdictional, and a complaint accompanied by a false statutory affidavit would be regarded as insufficient to empower the court to grant a decree of divorce; the correct procedure for relief against the decree would be by motion in the cause.

         Not Advisable for Attorney to Act as Notary and Verify Client’s Divorce Complaint. —

        When one partner of Firm A appears as attorney for a plaintiff in a divorce proceeding, the other partners in the firm also appear, and they could be prohibited under former G.S. 47-8 from notarizing the verification of the client. This would be true whether or not the firm appears as “of counsel” to the individual partner on the face of the complaint or answer. Therefore, such practice should be avoided, and as an attorney/notary who acts in this fashion proceeds at his own risk. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James Lee Knight, Notary Public, Guilford County, 58 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 35 (1988).

      <p>
       The provisions of this section that the allegations of the complaint in an action for divorce “are deemed to be denied” applies only to the trial upon the merits, since the facts must be found by a jury (now a judge or jury).

      <p>
       The denial by the statute of the plaintiff’s allegations in an action for divorce presumes, as a matter of law, a meritorious defense, and does not require that this be found by the judge in passing upon a motion to set aside a judgment rendered in an action.

       The defendant in an action for divorce a vinculo, may file a cross-action for the same relief, and where no reply has been filed by the plaintiff, and no evidence has been offered by him, an issue is raised by this section, and upon a verdict on the required issues, a judgment may be rendered upon the cross-action if the pleadings and the evidence are sufficient.

       Since this section declares in effect that the material allegations of the complaint in a divorce action shall be deemed and treated as denied, it is inconsequential whether or not the defendant enters a denial, and the entry of a specific denial by the defendant, under discretionary leave of the court, cannot prejudice the plaintiff.

      <p>
       Under this section and G.S. 50-8, upon the basic principle that a plaintiff must prove what he must allege, a plaintiff is entitled to a judgment of divorce only if the issues submitted and answered in favor of the plaintiff establish, inter alia, (1) the requisite facts as to residence, and (2) that (except where the alleged cause for divorce is one year’s separation) the facts set forth as grounds for divorce have existed to his or her knowledge for at least six months prior to the filing of the complaint. Pruett v. Pruett, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 13</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 296, 1957 N.C. LEXIS 550 (1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations required by G.S. 50-8 are indispensable constituent elements of a divorce action and must be established either by the verdict of a jury or by a judge, as the pertinent statute may permit. Eudy v. Eudy, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 71</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 782, 1975 N.C. LEXIS 883 (1975), overruled, Quick v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 446</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 653, 1982 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory changes eliminating the necessity for the filing of an affidavit and allowing a judge in some cases to become the trier of facts in divorce actions do not change the fundamental precepts that jurisdiction over the subject matter of divorce is statutory and that all averments required by the statute must be both alleged in the complaint and found by the finder of fact to be true before a divorce judgment may be entered.

       This section is declarative of the common law in that one of the rights which determines and ceases after a judgment of absolute divorce is the right to support. McCarley v. McCarley, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 109</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 490, 1976 N.C. LEXIS 1223 (1976).

        Power to Enter Alimony Order Ends upon Divorce. —

      <p>
       When a party has secured an absolute divorce, it is beyond the power of the court thereafter to enter an order for alimony. Mitchell v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 253</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 71, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1333 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife’s answer and counterclaim did not sufficiently preserve her claim for alimony, under G.S. 50-11(c), after an absolute divorce was granted, when she requested a certain monthly amount of alimony, because such a claim could arise on several alternative grounds requiring a trial court’s consideration of at least 16 “relevant factors” in determining whether statutory grounds existed to award alimony, and if so whether such an award was equitable under G.S. 50-16.3A; so, under G.S. 1A-1-8(a)(1), an alimony pleading had to contain notice of the grounds upon which this relief was sought, and as the wife’s answer did not state such grounds, it was insufficient. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d 332, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 475 (2007).

      <p>
       Where the parties invoked the jurisdiction of the district court to equitably distribute their marital property in the action for absolute divorce and equitable distribution of their marital property, the district court did not lose jurisdiction to equitably distribute the marital property because of its failure to enter a judgment in the equitable distribution case before the special proceeding seeking partition of the marital property was filed in the office of the clerk of superior court.

        Jurisdiction Over Child Support. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a North Carolina judgment of absolute divorce made no provision for child support, and there was thus no existing order, the Texas Attorney General’s petition to establish a support obligation was properly classified as a petition to establish an order of support rather than a petition to modify an order of no support; thus, under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Texas trial court had the authority to adjudicate the father’s child support obligation, and because the North Carolina tribunal had not acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting the father’s plea to the jurisdiction.

       If alimony is found to be appropriate after a hearing on remand, the ensuing judgment or decree awarding it will relate back to the time when the application for alimony should have been considered, which is “before or at the time of the rendering of the judgment for absolute divorce.” McCarley v.

        Decree of Absolute Divorce on Counterclaim to Action for Alimony as Interlocutory Judgment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree of absolute divorce upon a counterclaim to an action for alimony without divorce was not a final judgment as to the remainder of the claims to be adjudicated in the action. Instead, it was merely an interlocutory judgment, to become final upon a complete adjudication of all claims, rights and liabilities of the parties. It did not terminate or determine the remaining issues arising from the pleadings in the action. Therefore, the court could amend, modify or rescind it at anytime prior to final judgment. Hamilton v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 245 S.E.2d 399, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2621 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 574</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 441, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1201 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment of absolute divorce upon a counterclaim to an action for alimony without divorce, rendered prior to final determination of all issues, was interlocutory and subject to the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 54(b), for purposes of determining its finality. Hamilton v. Hamilton, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 245 S.E.2d 399, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2621 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 574</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 441, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1201 (1979).

        Effect of Absolute Divorce on Prior Judgment for Alimony Without Divorce. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment for absolute divorce awarded to the husband on the ground of two years’ (now one year’s) separation did not invalidate a judgment for alimony without divorce entered in favor of the wife before the action for absolute divorce was instituted. Blankenship v. Blankenship, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 638</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 857, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 523 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) merely requires an equitable distribution claim to be asserted at any time prior to judgment,
   
   and does not prohibit a claim asserted before a divorce action is filed. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1031 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a husband’s motion to dismiss a wife’s motion for equitable distribution, pursuant to G.S. 50-20, in a divorce action where the wife filed the motion on the day before the judgment was signed by the judge and filed, at which point the judgment became final pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-58; therefore, G.S. 50-11(e) did not destroy the wife’s right to seek equitable distribution as the motion was filed before an absolute divorce was granted. Santana v. Santana, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 614 S.E.2d 438, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1204 (2005).

        Equitable Distribution After Judgment of Absolute Divorce. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a judgment of absolute divorce destroys the right to equitable distribution unless the right is asserted prior to judgment of absolute divorce. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 585, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2503 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person entitled to equitable distribution does not specifically apply for it by cross-action or by a separate action prior to the judgment of absolute divorce, the divorce judgment destroys that person’s statutory right to equitable distribution. Lutz v. Lutz, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 399 S.E.2d 385, <cite class="nc_code">1991 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 6 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       If alimony and equitable distribution claims are properly asserted, whether by the filing of an action or raising of counterclaims, and are not voluntarily dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) until after judgment of absolute divorce is entered, a new action based on those claims may be filed within the one year period provided by the rule. Stegall v. Stegall, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 473</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 177, 1994 N.C. LEXIS 299 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subsection (e) requires that a claim for equitable distribution be brought prior to the granting of the divorce; where the trial court granted defendant relief from the judgment of absolute divorce and permitted defendant to file her answer, the effect was the same as if the judgment had never been entered, and defendant’s right to equitable distribution was revived. Baker v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 444 S.E.2d 478, <cite class="nc_code">1994 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 616 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife sufficiently preserved her claim to an equitable distribution of marital property under G.S. 50-11(e) when her answer to her husband’s complaint for divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and G.S. 50-21(a) gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife’s counterclaim for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties’ marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties’ marital and divisible property. Coleman v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 641 S.E.2d 332, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 475 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceedings in which a former husband was granted an absolute divorce, the former wife was not entitled to compel an equitable distribution affidavit from the former husband because the wife failed to properly file her equitable distribution claim pursuant to G.S. 50-21(a) as a separate action, cross-action, or motion in the cause within six months after the husband dismissed his own equitable distribution claim as required by G.S. 50-11(e) and (f); an oral motion by the wife for such a claim did not constitute the required motion. Webb v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 656 S.E.2d 334, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 203 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife could not appeal an order granting a husband’s motion to vacate a judgment of absolute divorce to allow the husband to assert an equitable distribution claim because, inter alia, the wife did not show the order affected a substantial right as (1) the husband was not collaterally estopped, based on G.S. 50-11(e), from making an equitable distribution claim, since no such claim had been adjudicated, so the order did not expose the wife to the risk of an inconsistent equitable distribution judgment, and (2) the wife did not show any representations the wife had made about the wife’s marital status amounted to a substantial right. Campbell v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 764 S.E.2d 630, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1103 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting defendant wife’s motion to be “relieved of the effect” of a divorce judgment
   
   solely to the extent that the judgment barred her claim for equitable distribution. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 87</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 585, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2503 (1987).

       Where, pending wife’s action for alimony without divorce, husband obtained decree of absolute divorce on the ground of separation for the statutory period under G.S. 50-6, it was held that the final judgment in her action would be rendered after absolute divorce, and that she therefore would not be entitled to permanent alimony in her action, since under the common law she would not be entitled to alimony after a divorce a vinculo, and that the saving provisions of this section would not be applicable.

       An alimony claim made pursuant to G.S. 50-16.3A(a) and filed within one year of plaintiff’s dismissal of her first claim (under repealed G.S. 50-16.6(a)) failed to qualify as “a new action based on the same claim” under Rule 41(a)(1) because the G.S. 50-16.3A(a) claim for alimony was distinct from that set out by the repealed section in that it deferred to the court’s discretion on the decision of whether to award alimony where both the supporting and dependent spouse “each participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior,” whereas the old section foreclosed a dependent spouse from recovering; to allow her to maintain this new action would have deprived the defendant/husband of a statutory absolute defense he had had under the old law.

   Even if the court had effectively set aside, briefly, the divorce decree itself and then immediately reinstated the divorce decree with a reservation of an equitable distribution claim, the reservation of the equitable distribution claim would have been a legal nullity because plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his equitable distribution claim and defendant did not, during the time the divorce was arguably set aside, file an answer, counterclaim, or separate action requesting equitable distribution.

       Where a North Carolina judgment of absolute divorce made no provision for child support, and there was thus no existing order, the Texas Attorney General’s petition to establish a support obligation was properly classified as a petition to establish an order of support rather than a petition to modify an order of no support; thus, under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Texas trial court had the authority to adjudicate the father’s child support obligation, and because the North Carolina tribunal had not acquired continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, the trial court erred in granting the father’s plea to the jurisdiction.

        Effect of Separation Agreement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       While the marital and property rights of the parties under the provisions of a valid separation agreement cannot be ignored or set aside by the court without consent of the parties, such agreements are not final and binding as to the custody of minor children or as to the amount to be provided for the support and education of such minor children. Soper v. Soper, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 223 S.E.2d 560, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2383 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where parties to a separation agreement agree upon the amount of the support and maintenance of their minor children, there is a presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the amount mutually agreed upon is just and reasonable and that upon motion for an increase in such allowance, a court is not warranted in ordering an increase in the absence of any evidence of a change of conditions.

      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.01ol14">

       Any parent, relative, or other person, agency, organization or institution claiming the right to custody of a minor child may institute an action or proceeding for the custody of such child, as hereinafter provided. Any person whose actions resulted in a conviction under G.S. 14-27.21, G.S. 14-27.22, G.S. 14-27.23, or G.S. 14-27.24 and the conception of the minor child may not claim the right to custody of that minor child.

       Whenever it appears to the court, from the pleadings or otherwise, that an action involves a contested issue as to the custody or visitation of a minor child, the matter, where there is a program established pursuant to G.S. 7A-494, shall be set for mediation of the unresolved issues as to custody and visitation before or concurrent with the setting of the matter for hearing unless the court waives mediation pursuant to subsection (c). Issues that arise in motions for contempt or for modifications as well as in other pleadings shall be set for mediation unless mediation is waived by the court. Alimony, child support, and other economic issues may not be referred for mediation pursuant to this section. The purposes of mediation under this section include the pursuit of the following goals:
       <ol>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1b1">
         To reduce any acrimony that exists between the parties to a dispute involving custody or visitation of a minor child;

        </li>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1b5">
         To reduce the relitigation of custody and visitation disputes.

       For good cause, on the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the court may waive the mandatory setting under Article 39A of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of a contested custody or visitation matter for mediation. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, the following: a showing of undue hardship to a party; an agreement between the parties for voluntary mediation, subject to court approval; allegations of abuse or neglect of the minor child; allegations of alcoholism, drug abuse, or domestic violence between the parents in common; or allegations of severe psychological, psychiatric, or emotional problems. A showing by either party that the party resides more than fifty miles from the court may be considered good cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1d">
       Either party may move to have the mediation proceedings dismissed and the action heard in court due to the mediator’s bias, undue familiarity with a party, or other prejudicial ground.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1e">
       Mediation proceeding shall be held in private and shall be confidential. Except as provided in this Article, all verbal or written communications from either or both parties to the mediator or between the parties in the presence of the mediator made in a proceeding pursuant to this section are absolutely privileged and inadmissible in court. The mediator may assess the needs and interests of the child, and may interview the child or others who are not parties to the proceedings when he or she thinks appropriate.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1f">
       Neither the mediator nor any party or other person involved in mediation sessions under this section shall be competent to testify to communications made during or in furtherance of such mediation sessions; provided, there is no privilege as to communications made in furtherance of a crime or fraud. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting an individual to obtain immunity from prosecution for criminal conduct or as excusing an individual from the reporting requirements of Article 3 of Chapter 7B of the General Statutes or G.S. 108A-102.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1g">
       Any agreement reached by the parties as a result of the mediation shall be reduced to writing, signed by each party, and submitted to the court as soon as practicable. Unless the court finds good reason not to, it shall incorporate the agreement in a court order and it shall become enforceable as a court order. If some or all of the issues as to custody or visitation are not resolved by mediation, the mediator shall report that fact to the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.1ol1h">
       If an agreement that results from mediation and is incorporated into a court order is referred to as a “parenting agreement” or called by some similar name, it shall nevertheless be deemed to be a custody order or child custody determination for purposes of Chapter 50A of the General Statutes, G.S. 14-320.1, G.S. 110-139.1, or other places where those terms appear.
      </li>

       If the child whose custody is the subject of an action under this Chapter also is the subject of a juvenile abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding pursuant to Subchapter 1 of Chapter 7B of the General Statutes, then the custody action under this Chapter is stayed as provided in G.S. 7B-200.

       Trial court, in a custody case involving the son where reunification with a parent was the original goal and the county social services agency had obtained legal custody of him while awaiting a permanent disposition, did not enter a proper civil child-custody order pursuant to G.S. 7B-911. It made no findings of fact regarding its decision to transfer the son’s juvenile case pursuant to “Chapter 50,” G.S. 50-13.1, and to terminate its jurisdiction.

       Child custody action was not pending when a neglect proceeding was initiated because as the juvenile court obtained jurisdiction over the children, the juvenile court had continuing exclusive jurisdiction unless jurisdiction was terminated by order of the court; at the time the father filed the civil custody action, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the child custody action because of the already pending neglect proceeding.

       Trial court erred in dismissing a father’s action for custody of his son, as it did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to a prior pending adoption proceeding involving the son; the “prior pending action” doctrine did not apply, as the parties were not the same in both actions and they did not request the same relief.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly dismissed a grandfather’s complaint for custody of his maternal grandchild because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to proceed due to a pre-existing child custody action between the child’s paternal grandparents and the child’s now-deceased mother, which did not abate for reasons of constitutional and statutory law and, and, while any relative could seek custody of a child, the grandfather did not file suit against an allegedly unfit parent, and as his complaint was more akin to a request to modify the custody order than it was an initial claim for custody, the proper procedure for the grandfather was to file a motion to intervene and a motion for custody in the grandparents’ custody action.

       Child’s putative father had standing to seek the child’s custody, under G.S. 50-13.1(a), before his paternity was proved, based on the trial court’s findings that the child shared his last name, and he had visited the child for two years since the child’s birth.

       Former domestic partner’s allegations that she was an “other person” who had standing to seek custody were sufficient under Ellison to support a trial court’s denial of a biological mother’s motion to dismiss the partner’s petition for custody. The partner established standing under G.S. 50-13.1 by alleging that she and the mother: (1) jointly raised the child; (2) entered into a parenting agreement in which they each acknowledged that the partner was a de facto parent; (3) the partner had formed a psychological parenting relationship with the child; and (4) the child had lived all his life enjoying the equal participation of the mother and the partner in his emotional and financial care and support, guidance and decision-making.

       When a mother sued the adoptive parents of the mother’s children for, inter alia, visitation with the children, the mother was not a qualified “other person,” under G.S. 50-13.1, because, once the mother consented to the children’s adoption by the adoptive parents, the mother was a legal stranger to the children who had no right to seek visitation with or custody of the children.

       Third-party caregivers lacked standing to seek custody of a two-year-old child under G.S. 50-13.4(a) because they only cared for the child and provided medical care for the child for two months, which was not a significant amount of time to establish a parent-child relationship with the child.

       Trial court properly dismissed a former partner’s complaint seeking custody of a minor child for lack of standing where although the former partner had a parent-child relationship with the children during her relationship with the mother, that relationship ended when she evicted them from the residence, that fact defeated her standing as an other person under G.S. 50-13.1, and because she never alleged that either biological parent was unfit or had abandoned or neglected the children, she failed to overcome the presumption that they had superior rights.

       Conclusion of law that it was in a child’s best interest to grant legal custody to the child’s father was supported by the findings of fact because the father’s fitness and ability to provide proper care to and supervision of the child and the mother’s unfitness and inability to provide proper care for the child were uncontested as it was found: (1) that the father’s visitation with the child had gone well; (2) that the child enjoyed a loving relationship with the father; (3) that the father was the child’s biological father; (4) that the father had not abrogated his constitutional rights to parent the child; and (5) that, even though the father testified that he did not want to disrupt the child’s situation by having the child live with him permanently, he also testified that he would take the child.

       Reading subsection (a) in conjunction with G.S. 50-13.2(b1), 50-13.5(j), and 50-13.2A strongly suggests that the legislature did not intend “custody” and “visitation” to be interpreted as synonymous in the context of grandparents’ rights. The three special statutes provide grandparents with the right to seek “visitation” only in certain clearly specified situations. Those situations do not include that of initiating suit against parents whose family is intact and where no custody proceeding is ongoing. McIntyre v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 629</cite>, 461 S.E.2d 745, 1995 N.C. LEXIS 409 (1995).

       This statute is available for grandparents who seek visitation rights in two situations: (1) when the parents are unfit, have abandoned or neglected the child or have died; or (2) when by separation or divorce, custody is at issue between the parents; therefore, the statute was unavailable to a biological grandmother whose grandchildren had been adopted by their biological aunt.

       When grandparents initiate custody lawsuits under G.S. 50-13.1(a), those grandparents are not required to prove the grandchild is not living in an intact family in order to gain custody, instead, the grandparent must show that the parent is unfit or has taken action inconsistent with her parental status in order to gain custody of the child; the requirement to show unfitness if a grandparent initiates a custody dispute is consistent with a parent’s constitutionally protected right to the care, custody, and control of the child and protects the parent’s right to control with whom his child associates on a daily basis. Eakett v. Eakett, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 579 S.E.2d 486, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 729 (2003).

       Intact family rule protects the parental right to determine with whom her children shall associate so a grandparent cannot initiate a lawsuit for visitation rights unless the child’s family is already undergoing some strain on the family relationship, such as an adoption or an ongoing custody battle; accordingly, the grandparent’s rights to the care, custody and control of the child are not constitutionally protected while the parent’s rights are protected.

       Mother was properly permitted to relocate with the parties’ three children to Minnesota under G.S. 50-13.1 as: (1) neither the father nor the mother had a support system in North Carolina; (2) the maternal grandmother could assist in supporting the children if the mother and the children moved back to Minnesota; (3) the mother had a job lined up in Minnesota; (4) the advantages of relocation to the children outweighed the disadvantages, and relocation was in the children’s best interests; and (5) the father’s visitation rights had to be subordinated to the children’s best interests.

       Because an order was best characterized as a temporary child custody order under G.S. ch. 50 rather than as a disposition order under G.S. ch. 7B, and was set for review in approximately four months, it was an interlocutory order that did not affect any substantial right and was not appealable.

       When a stepmother was granted ex parte temporary custody of orphaned stepchildren, an aunt’s subsequent guardianship petition made the custody action moot because, (1) in the guardianship case, the clerk properly exercised jurisdiction, as the children had no natural guardian, and the clerk’s jurisdiction was not divested by the ex parte temporary custody order, since the clerk considered other courts’ custody awards, so the clerk had jurisdiction to appoint the children’s general guardians, an incident of which was physical custody, and (2) any guardianship modification, including custody modification, required filing a motion with the clerk instead of a district court custody action.

       An order for custody of a minor child entered pursuant to this section shall award the custody of such child to such person, agency, organization or institution as will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. In making the determination, the court shall consider all relevant factors including acts of domestic violence between the parties, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party from domestic violence by the other party. An order for custody must include written findings of fact that reflect the consideration of each of these factors and that support the determination of what is in the best interest of the child. Between the parents, whether natural or adoptive, no presumption shall apply as to who will better promote the interest and welfare of the child. Joint custody to the parents shall be considered upon the request of either parent.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1b">
       An order for custody of a minor child may grant joint custody to the parents, exclusive custody to one person, agency, organization, or institution, or grant custody to two or more persons, agencies, organizations, or institutions. Any order for custody shall include such terms, including visitation, as will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. If the court finds that domestic violence has occurred, the court shall enter such orders that best protect the children and party who were the victims of domestic violence, in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 50B-3(a1)(1), (2), and (3). If a party is absent or relocates with or without the children because of an act of domestic violence, the absence or relocation shall not be a factor that weighs against the party in determining custody or visitation. Absent an order of the court to the contrary, each parent shall have equal access to the records of the minor child involving the health, education, and welfare of the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1-b1">
       An order for custody of a minor child may provide visitation rights for any grandparent of the child as the court, in its discretion, deems appropriate. As used in this subsection, “grandparent” includes a biological grandparent of a child adopted by a stepparent or a relative of the child where a substantial relationship exists between the grandparent and the child. Under no circumstances shall a biological grandparent of a child adopted by adoptive parents, neither of whom is related to the child and where parental rights of both biological parents have been terminated, be entitled to visitation rights.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1-b2">
       Any order for custody, including visitation, may, as a condition of such custody or visitation, require either or both parents, or any other person seeking custody or visitation, to abstain from consuming alcohol and may require submission to a continuous alcohol monitoring system, of a type approved by the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice of the Department of Public Safety, to verify compliance with this condition of custody or visitation. Any order pursuant to this subsection shall include an order to the monitoring provider to report any violation of the order to the court and each party to the action. Failure to comply with this condition shall be grounds for civil or criminal contempt.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1c">
       An order for custody of a minor child may provide for such child to be taken outside of the State, but if the order contemplates the return of the child to this State, the judge may require the person, agency, organization or institution having custody out of this State to give bond or other security conditioned upon the return of the child to this State in accordance with the order of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1d">
       If, within a reasonable time, one parent fails to consent to adoption pursuant to Chapter 48 of the General Statutes or parental rights have not been terminated, the consent of the other consenting parent shall not be effective in an action for custody of the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1e">
       An order for custody of a minor child may provide for visitation rights by electronic communication. In granting visitation by electronic communication, the court shall consider the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1e1">
         Whether electronic communication is in the best interest of the minor child.
        </li>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1e2">
         Whether equipment to communicate by electronic means is available, accessible, and affordable to the parents of the minor child.
        </li>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1e3">
         Any other factor the court deems appropriate in determining whether to grant visitation by electronic communication.

      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2ol1f">
       In a proceeding for custody of a minor child of a service member, a court may not consider a parent’s past deployment or possible future deployment as the only basis in determining the best interest of the child. The court may consider any significant impact on the best interest of the child regarding the parent’s past or possible future deployment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The court may set guidelines for electronic communication, including the hours in which the communication may be made, the allocation of costs between the parents in implementing electronic communication with the child, and the furnishing of access information between parents necessary to facilitate electronic communication. Electronic communication with a minor child may be used to supplement visitation with the child. Electronic communication may not be used as a replacement or substitution for custody or visitation. The amount of time electronic communication is used shall not be a factor in calculating child support or be used to justify or support relocation by the custodial parent out of the immediate area or the State. Electronic communication between the minor child and the parent may be subject to supervision as ordered by the court. As used in this subsection, “electronic communication” means contact, other than face-to-face contact, facilitated by electronic means, such as by telephone, electronic mail, instant messaging, video teleconferencing, wired or wireless technologies by Internet, or other medium of communication.

       [
   
    Editor’s note.
   
   — This comment is the Official Comment to Section 107 of the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act, which was the basis for subsection (f) as added by Session Laws 2013-27, s. 1.
   The Official Comment is printed here pursuant to the authority in Session Laws 2013-27, s. 5, for the Revisor of Statutes to cause the Official Comments to the Act to be printed.
   For other provisions of the Act, see Article 3 (Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, G.S. 50A-350 et seq.]
      </p>
      <p>
       [Section] 107 [subsection (f) of this section], in contrast to later articles of the Act [Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act], does not directly concern custody procedures in conjunction with a service member’s deployment. Instead, it seeks to amend the state’s general standard for child custody to guard against the possibility that courts will use past or possible future deployment as a negative factor in determining custody by service members without serious consideration of whether the child’s best interest was or would be truly compromised by such deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [subsection (f)], prohibits the court from using a parent’s past deployment or possible future deployment itself as a negative factor in determining the best interests of the child. However, the significant effects on the child of the parent’s past or possible future service may be considered. The term “significant” is meant to exclude the court’s considering trivial impact of a parent’s deployment, such as the need to enroll a child in a different school. Under this standard, the court may only consider impacts that are material or substantial. For example, the court may consider that the child has bonded closely with step-siblings while in a temporary custody arrangement during a deployment, or that the child does not adjust well to new situations and therefore will likely have difficulty relocating if a parent is deployed in the future.

        The plain language of G.S. 50-13.2(b) is referring to the party who is absent or has relocated with or without the children because of an act of domestic violence; therefore, a mother’s claim that the trial court violated G.S. 50-13.2(b) failed because that language did not apply to the situation since the mother had not relocated due to an act of domestic violence, or, to the extent the language of the section could apply, it would apply to the father who had relocated to another country. Thus, the trial court was required not to weigh the father’s absence or relocation against him in determining custody or visitation. Jordao v. Jordao, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C.

        Because the legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care, because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court’s jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding.

       <p>
        Denial to a noncustodial mother of access to the medical, educational, and counseling records of the mother’s child was in error because the court’s findings of fact did not support a conclusion that it was in the best interest of the child to prevent the mother from accessing the records. While the mother’s behavior at the child’s school was disruptive, the findings did not indicate that the mother’s behavior made third-party professionals sufficiently concerned about their own safety, or have any other negative effect on the child.

        Trial court erred in a custody case in finding that the father had committed domestic violence because, in a prior domestic violence case, the court specifically found that the father had not committed domestic violence; G.S. 50-13.2(a) required the court in a custody case to consider domestic violence, but collateral estoppel prevented the court in the custody case from making findings which were contrary to the findings in the prior domestic violence action.

        The best interest and welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in determining the visitation rights, as well as in determining the right to custody, and neither of these rights should be permitted to jeopardize the best interest and welfare of the child.

        Although at one time under the common law the father was generally entitled to the custody of minor children, the courts at the present time almost invariably adhere to the principle that the welfare or best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.

        The guiding principle to be used by the court in a custody hearing is the welfare of the children involved. While this guiding principle is clear, decision in particular cases is often difficult, and necessarily a wide discretion is vested in the trial judge. He has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses, and his decision ought not to be upset on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Greer v.

        Trial court’s best interests of the children determination under G.S. 50-13.2(a) was supported by its findings of fact, including its finding that the father had “body slammed” the mother 20 to 50 times during the marriage, and threatened to punch his brother-in-law in the nose.

        In making custody decisions between a parent and a grandparent or other third party, the court must balance two doctrines.
   
   The first, the “parental right” doctrine, holds that ordinarily and in the absence of particular circumstances, the custody of a child should be given to the parent in preference to the grandparent, if the parent is found to be fit to have custody and can supply a proper home. The second doctrine, the “best interests of the child” doctrine, holds that custody should be awarded in accordance with the best interests of the child regardless of the fitness of the parents.

       <p>
        If the mother and the father are both fit and proper persons to have custody of children, under ordinary circumstances the court would then proceed to determine whether the best interest, health and welfare of the children would be served by awarding custody to the mother or father. If not, then the court must deal with someone or an agency over whom the court has control. But an order awarding custody, in effect, to third persons who are not parties to the proceeding, not a public institution, and not bound by the court’s order, must be reversed. Boone v.

       <p>
        Illegitimate child’s father who has acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a) and whose conduct is consistent with his right to care for and control his child has a right to custody of his illegitimate child legally equal to that of the child’s mother, and, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2, if the best interest of the child is served by placing the child in the father’s custody, he is to be awarded custody of that child.

       </p>
       <p>
        As the common-law rule that custody of an illegitimate child presumptively vested in the mother was abrogated by G.S. 50-13.2(a), the trial court properly applied the “best interest of the child” standard in awarding custody to the child’s father, who had acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a), paid child support without a court order, and provided that child with a stable and structured life. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 193</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 41, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 605 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1177, 124 S. Ct. 1407, 158 L. Ed. 2d 78, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 1045 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the best interest of the child standard to award joint custody of an illegitimate child to the parents, district court applied the correct standard as between the parents, because the common law presumption in favor of awarding custody of the illegitimate child to the mother was abrogated by G.S. 50-13.2 and the case law.

        Trial court erred in concluding a grandmother’s visitation rights under a prior custody order did not survive termination of a mother’s parental rights because the grandmother not only intervened in the case but also obtained visitation rights via a permanent custody order; thus, the termination of the mother’s parental rights did not extinguish the grandmother’s court-ordered visitation rights, and the grandmother could seek to enforce the prior custody order through contempt proceedings.

        A child may be a competent witness and ought to be examined in that character. Indeed, being the party mainly concerned, he has a right to make a statement to the court as to his feelings and wishes upon the matter. This ought to be allowed serious consideration by the court, in the exercise of its discretion. Kearns v. Kearns, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C.

        The child’s wishes will be one factor considered by the court in determining his custody, usually not because of any legal right in the child to have his wishes granted, but because the consideration of such wishes will aid the court in making a custodial decree which is for the best interests and welfare of the child.

       <p>
        When a child has reached the age of discretion, the court may consider the preference or wishes of the child to live with a particular person. A child has attained an age of discretion when it is of an age and capacity to form an intelligent or rational view on the matter. The expressed wish of a child of discretion is, however, never controlling upon the court, since the court must yield in all cases to what it considers to be the child’s best interests, regardless of the child’s personal preference. Hinkle v. Hinkle, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 189</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 73, 1966 N.C. LEXIS 1311 (1966).

       <p>
        To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Montgomery v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 231 S.E.2d 26, <cite class="nc_code">1977 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1873 (1977); Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The court erred in not permitting the parties to a “joint custody” agreement to present extrinsic evidence
   
   of the parties’ understanding of the meaning of those terms and their intent at the time of the agreement before determining whether the plaintiff wife had breached the agreement by failing to take steps to help the son who had drug abuse problems, thereby excusing the defendant husband from paying alimony.

       </p>
       <p>
        Before awarding custody of a child to a particular party, the trial court must conclude as a matter of law that the award of custody to that particular party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Findings of fact as to the characteristics of the competing parties must be made to support the necessary conclusion of law. These findings may concern physical, mental, or financial fitness or any other factors brought out in the evidence and relevant to the issue of the welfare of the child. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 244 S.E.2d 466, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2557 (1978).

        To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the interest and welfare of the child; the conclusion of law determinative of the custody is not, therefore, that the person gaining custody is a fit and proper person to have custody, but which party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child.

        A custody order is fatally defective where it fails to make detailed findings of fact from which an appellate court can determine that the order is in the best interest of the child, and custody orders are routinely vacated where the findings of fact consist of mere conclusory statements that the party being awarded custody is a fit and proper person to have custody and that it will be in the best interests of the child to award custody to that person.

        The trial court erred in amending the custody decree based on a finding of substantial change in circumstances where it found only that the proposed relocation of the mother after her remarriage would adversely affect the relationship between the father and his child but made no other findings about the effect of the proposed relocation on the child and on the child’s best interests.

        While a court had the power under G.S. 7B-903 to enter an order transferring the custody of a minor child from her father to her mother, there was no evidence in the record in a proceeding on the parties’ cross-motions for contempt that supported the finding that transferring custody to the mother was in the child’s best interests. The court made only one finding, that the child missed the two people in her life who had neglected her, which was not a basis for not allowing custody to remain with the father, the trial court had a right under G.S. 50-13.2(a) to consider, but did not consider, acts of domestic violence by the child’s stepfather toward her mother when determining the child’s best interests, and the trial court had no right to take custody away from the father simply because he was unmarried.

        It is error for the court granting a decree of divorce to award the custody of a child without findings of fact from which it could be determined that the order was adequately supported by competent evidence and was for the best interest of the child.

        Trial court erred in granting permanent custody of a child to the child’s natural parent, who had extremely limited contact with the child before the other parent’s death, because it was speculative to assess what the quality of their relationship would be after a four-month “get acquainted” period during which temporary custody had been granted to the child’s grandparents.

        When a father filed a motion for modification of custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in looking back to the facts surrounding the best interests of the child, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2(a), at the time the memorandum of judgment was entered to make appropriate findings to provide a base line before it could determine if there had been a material change in circumstances, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7, because the mother and father had waived findings of fact and conclusions of law at the time the memorandum of judgment by consent was entered.

        When a case is properly before it, the court has the duty to award custody in accordance with the best interests of the child, and no agreement, consent or condition between the parents can interfere with this duty or bind the court.

       An order for custody of a minor child entered pursuant to this section shall award the custody of such child to such person, agency, organization or institution as will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. In making the determination, the court shall consider all relevant factors including acts of domestic violence between the parties, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party from domestic violence by the other party. An order for custody must include written findings of fact that reflect the consideration of each of these factors and that support the determination of what is in the best interest of the child. Between the parents, whether natural or adoptive, no presumption shall apply as to who will better promote the interest and welfare of the child. Joint custody to the parents shall be considered upon the request of either parent.
      </li>

       An order for custody of a minor child may grant joint custody to the parents, exclusive custody to one person, agency, organization, or institution, or grant custody to two or more persons, agencies, organizations, or institutions. Any order for custody shall include such terms, including visitation, as will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. If the court finds that domestic violence has occurred, the court shall enter such orders that best protect the children and party who were the victims of domestic violence, in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 50B-3(a1)(1), (2), and (3). If a party is absent or relocates with or without the children because of an act of domestic violence, the absence or relocation shall not be a factor that weighs against the party in determining custody or visitation. Absent an order of the court to the contrary, each parent shall have equal access to the records of the minor child involving the health, education, and welfare of the child.

      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2.1.ol1-b1">
       An order for custody of a minor child may provide visitation rights for any grandparent of the child as the court, in its discretion, deems appropriate. As used in this subsection, “grandparent” includes a biological grandparent of a child adopted by a stepparent or a relative of the child where a substantial relationship exists between the grandparent and the child. Under no circumstances shall a biological grandparent of a child adopted by adoptive parents, neither of whom is related to the child and where parental rights of both biological parents have been terminated, be entitled to visitation rights.

       Any order for custody, including visitation, may, as a condition of such custody or visitation, require either or both parents, or any other person seeking custody or visitation, to abstain from consuming alcohol and may require submission to a continuous alcohol monitoring system, of a type approved by the Division of Community Supervision and Reentry of the Department of Adult Correction, to verify compliance with this condition of custody or visitation. Any order pursuant to this subsection shall include an order to the monitoring provider to report any violation of the order to the court and each party to the action. Failure to comply with this condition shall be grounds for civil or criminal contempt.

       An order for custody of a minor child may provide for such child to be taken outside of the State, but if the order contemplates the return of the child to this State, the judge may require the person, agency, organization or institution having custody out of this State to give bond or other security conditioned upon the return of the child to this State in accordance with the order of the court.

      <li id="t50a01s50-13.2.1.ol1e">
       An order for custody of a minor child may provide for visitation rights by electronic communication. In granting visitation by electronic communication, the court shall consider the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t50a01s50-13.2.1.ol1e1">
         Whether electronic communication is in the best interest of the minor child.

       In a proceeding for custody of a minor child of a service member, a court may not consider a parent’s past deployment or possible future deployment as the only basis in determining the best interest of the child. The court may consider any significant impact on the best interest of the child regarding the parent’s past or possible future deployment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The court may set guidelines for electronic communication, including the hours in which the communication may be made, the allocation of costs between the parents in implementing electronic communication with the child, and the furnishing of access information between parents necessary to facilitate electronic communication. Electronic communication with a minor child may be used to supplement visitation with the child. Electronic communication may not be used as a replacement or substitution for custody or visitation. The amount of time electronic communication is used shall not be a factor in calculating child support or be used to justify or support relocation by the custodial parent out of the immediate area or the State. Electronic communication between the minor child and the parent may be subject to supervision as ordered by the court. As used in this subsection, “electronic communication” means contact, other than face-to-face contact, facilitated by electronic means, such as by telephone, electronic mail, instant messaging, video teleconferencing, wired or wireless technologies by Internet, or other medium of communication.

    Editor’s note.
   
   — This comment is the Official Comment to Section 107 of the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act, which was the basis for subsection (f) as added by Session Laws 2013-27, s. 1.
   The Official Comment is printed here pursuant to the authority in Session Laws 2013-27, s. 5, for the Revisor of Statutes to cause the Official Comments to the Act to be printed.
   For other provisions of the Act, see Article 3 (Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, G.S. 50A-350 et seq.]
      </p>
      <p>
       [Section] 107 [subsection (f) of this section], in contrast to later articles of the Act [Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act], does not directly concern custody procedures in conjunction with a service member’s deployment. Instead, it seeks to amend the state’s general standard for child custody to guard against the possibility that courts will use past or possible future deployment as a negative factor in determining custody by service members without serious consideration of whether the child’s best interest was or would be truly compromised by such deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [subsection (f)], prohibits the court from using a parent’s past deployment or possible future deployment itself as a negative factor in determining the best interests of the child. However, the significant effects on the child of the parent’s past or possible future service may be considered. The term “significant” is meant to exclude the court’s considering trivial impact of a parent’s deployment, such as the need to enroll a child in a different school. Under this standard, the court may only consider impacts that are material or substantial. For example, the court may consider that the child has bonded closely with step-siblings while in a temporary custody arrangement during a deployment, or that the child does not adjust well to new situations and therefore will likely have difficulty relocating if a parent is deployed in the future.

        The plain language of G.S. 50-13.2(b) is referring to the party who is absent or has relocated with or without the children because of an act of domestic violence; therefore, a mother’s claim that the trial court violated G.S. 50-13.2(b) failed because that language did not apply to the situation since the mother had not relocated due to an act of domestic violence, or, to the extent the language of the section could apply, it would apply to the father who had relocated to another country. Thus, the trial court was required not to weigh the father’s absence or relocation against him in determining custody or visitation. Jordao v. Jordao, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C.

       <p>
        Because the legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care, because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court’s jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 238 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of an order of consolidation when the same child is the subject of a simultaneous custody and adoption proceeding, both the superior and district courts do not have continuing jurisdiction to fully adjudicate the respective issues before them. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 238 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of an adoption petition in the superior court divests the district court of jurisdiction to adjudicate issues of custody with regard to a child who is the subject of an adoption petition.

        Order requiring a custodial mother to move back to the county in which the parties had resided before separating to live in the marital home was set aside because, while the court could find the relative benefits of the children living with the father in one county or the mother in another county when making a primary custody determination, the order was not a “related matter” the general assembly gave trial courts the authority to decide.

        Trial court properly ordered that a mother share a child’s school and medical records with the father, as G.S. 50-13.2(b) provided that each parent have equal access to the records of the minor child involving the health, education, and welfare of the child.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial to a noncustodial mother of access to the medical, educational, and counseling records of the mother’s child was in error because the court’s findings of fact did not support a conclusion that it was in the best interest of the child to prevent the mother from accessing the records. While the mother’s behavior at the child’s school was disruptive, the findings did not indicate that the mother’s behavior made third-party professionals sufficiently concerned about their own safety, or have any other negative effect on the child.

        Trial court erred in a custody case in finding that the father had committed domestic violence because, in a prior domestic violence case, the court specifically found that the father had not committed domestic violence; G.S. 50-13.2(a) required the court in a custody case to consider domestic violence, but collateral estoppel prevented the court in the custody case from making findings which were contrary to the findings in the prior domestic violence action.

        The best interest and welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in determining the visitation rights, as well as in determining the right to custody, and neither of these rights should be permitted to jeopardize the best interest and welfare of the child. In re Stancil, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 179 S.E.2d 844, <cite class="nc_code">1971 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1674 (1971).

       <p>
        Although at one time under the common law the father was generally entitled to the custody of minor children, the courts at the present time almost invariably adhere to the principle that the welfare or best interest of the child is the paramount consideration. This was the rule adhered to by North Carolina courts for many years, and is now prescribed by this section. Brooks v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C.

        The guiding principle to be used by the court in a custody hearing is the welfare of the children involved. While this guiding principle is clear, decision in particular cases is often difficult, and necessarily a wide discretion is vested in the trial judge. He has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses, and his decision ought not to be upset on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Greer v.

        Trial court’s best interests of the children determination under G.S. 50-13.2(a) was supported by its findings of fact, including its finding that the father had “body slammed” the mother 20 to 50 times during the marriage, and threatened to punch his brother-in-law in the nose.

        Although a mother voluntarily dismissed her domestic violence complaint at the time a memorandum of judgment was entered regarding custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the claim when the father filed a motion for modification of custody, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7, because “acts of domestic violence between the parties” was one of the factors the trial court was to consider, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2(a), when making findings as to the best interests of the child.

        There are circumstances where the responsibility of a parent to act in the best interest of his or her child would require a temporary relinquishment of custody; however, to preserve the constitutional protection of parental interests in such a situation, the parent should notify the custodian upon relinquishment of custody that it is temporary and avoid conduct inconsistent with the protected parental interests.

        In making custody decisions between a parent and a grandparent or other third party, the court must balance two doctrines.
   
   The first, the “parental right” doctrine, holds that ordinarily and in the absence of particular circumstances, the custody of a child should be given to the parent in preference to the grandparent, if the parent is found to be fit to have custody and can supply a proper home. The second doctrine, the “best interests of the child” doctrine, holds that custody should be awarded in accordance with the best interests of the child regardless of the fitness of the parents.

A prior court order which judicially declares a parent to be incompetent is not sufficient in and of itself to establish a parent’s present unfitness to have a child or children; rather, this section requires a full, factual determination of all the circumstances in the case before a proper order may be entered by the court.

        The court committed prejudicial error in refusing to allow plaintiff to introduce evidence of defendant’s adultery at a hearing on a custody motion. While evidence of adultery does not impel a finding of unfitness of the adulterous parent, it is relevant upon an inquiry of fitness of a person for the purpose of awarding custody of minor children to him or to her.

        Illegitimate child’s father who has acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a) and whose conduct is consistent with his right to care for and control his child has a right to custody of his illegitimate child legally equal to that of the child’s mother, and, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2, if the best interest of the child is served by placing the child in the father’s custody, he is to be awarded custody of that child.

       <p>
        As the common-law rule that custody of an illegitimate child presumptively vested in the mother was abrogated by G.S. 50-13.2(a), the trial court properly applied the “best interest of the child” standard in awarding custody to the child’s father, who had acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a), paid child support without a court order, and provided that child with a stable and structured life. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 193</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 41, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 605 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1177, 124 S. Ct. 1407, 158 L. Ed. 2d 78, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 1045 (2004).

        In applying the best interest of the child standard to award joint custody of an illegitimate child to the parents, district court applied the correct standard as between the parents, because the common law presumption in favor of awarding custody of the illegitimate child to the mother was abrogated by G.S. 50-13.2 and the case law.

        Mother’s motion to dismiss grandparents’ motion for visitation was properly denied because, although the parents had entered into a consent judgment in the underlying child custody dispute, the custody of the child was still “in issue” and “being litigated” by the parents when the grandparents moved to intervene, and thus, under G.S. 50-13.2(b1), the grandparents had standing to intervene at the time; the resolution of the custody dispute between the parents did not wipe out the grandparents’ claim.

        Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father’s death and the child had not been adopted by a stepparent or relative.

        When a child has reached the age of discretion, the court may consider the preference or wishes of the child to live with a particular person. A child has attained an age of discretion when it is of an age and capacity to form an intelligent or rational view on the matter. The expressed wish of a child of discretion is, however, never controlling upon the court, since the court must yield in all cases to what it considers to be the child’s best interests, regardless of the child’s personal preference.

        Where trial judge enters a custody order that in his judgment is in the best interest of the child, the appellate division should not reverse that judgment and hold, as a matter of law, that the trial judge was obliged to have reached a different opinion, in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion. Decisions in custody cases are never easy, and the trial judge has the opportunity to see the parties in person and to hear the witnesses.

       <p>
        To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Montgomery v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 231 S.E.2d 26, <cite class="nc_code">1977 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1873 (1977); Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The court erred in not permitting the parties to a “joint custody” agreement to present extrinsic evidence
   
   of the parties’ understanding of the meaning of those terms and their intent at the time of the agreement before determining whether the plaintiff wife had breached the agreement by failing to take steps to help the son who had drug abuse problems, thereby excusing the defendant husband from paying alimony.

       </p>
       <p>
        Before awarding custody of a child to a particular party, the trial court must conclude as a matter of law that the award of custody to that particular party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child. Findings of fact as to the characteristics of the competing parties must be made to support the necessary conclusion of law. These findings may concern physical, mental, or financial fitness or any other factors brought out in the evidence and relevant to the issue of the welfare of the child. Steele v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 244 S.E.2d 466, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2557 (1978).

        To support an award of custody, the judgment of the trial court should contain findings of fact which sustain the conclusion of law that custody of the child is awarded to the person who will best promote the interest and welfare of the child; the conclusion of law determinative of the custody is not, therefore, that the person gaining custody is a fit and proper person to have custody, but which party will best promote the interest and welfare of the child.

The court made only one finding, that the child missed the two people in her life who had neglected her, which was not a basis for not allowing custody to remain with the father, the trial court had a right under G.S. 50-13.2(a) to consider, but did not consider, acts of domestic violence by the child’s stepfather toward her mother when determining the child’s best interests, and the trial court had no right to take custody away from the father simply because he was unmarried.

G.S. 50-13.1(a), 50-13.2(b1), this section, or 50-13.5(j). Shaut v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 834, 526 S.E.2d 214, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C.

       Grandparents lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation because there was no ongoing custody proceeding, as the mother had a natural and legal right to custody and control of the child upon the father’s death and the child had not been adopted by a stepparent or relative.

       Under G.S. 50-13.1(a), 50-13.2(b1), 50-13.2A, and 50-13.5(j), a grandparent’s right to visitation arises either in the context of an ongoing custody proceeding or where the minor child is in the custody of a stepparent or a relative—the “intact family” rule; in a case that does not involve adoption by a stepparent or other relative, a grandparent must prove that the child’s family is not intact before the grandparent can intervene to request visitation with his grandchild—G.S. 50-13.1(a), 50-13.2(b1), 50-13.2A, 50-13.5(j) does not grant grandparents the right to sue for visitation when no custody proceeding is ongoing and the minor children’s family is intact.

       In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, the father and mother shall be primarily liable for the support of a minor child. In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, parents of a minor, unemancipated child who is the custodial or noncustodial parent of a child shall share this primary liability for their grandchild’s support with the minor parent, the court determining the proper share, until the minor parent reaches the age of 18 or becomes emancipated. If both the parents of the child requiring support were unemancipated minors at the time of the child’s conception, the parents of both minor parents share primary liability for their grandchild’s support until both minor parents reach the age of 18 or become emancipated. If only one parent of the child requiring support was an unemancipated minor at the time of the child’s conception, the parents of both parents are liable for any arrearages in child support owed by the adult or emancipated parent until the other parent reaches the age of 18 or becomes emancipated. In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, any other person, agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis shall be secondarily liable for such support. Such other circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, the relative ability of all the above-mentioned parties to provide support or the inability of one or more of them to provide support, and the needs and estate of the child. The judge may enter an order requiring any one or more of the above-mentioned parties to provide for the support of the child as may be appropriate in the particular case, and if appropriate the court may authorize the application of any separate estate of the child to his support. However, the judge may not order support to be paid by a person who is not the child’s parent or an agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis absent evidence and a finding that such person, agency, organization or institution has voluntarily assumed the obligation of support in writing. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to prevent any court from ordering the support of a child by an agency of the State or county which agency may be responsible under law for such support.The judge may order responsible parents in a IV-D establishment case to perform a job search, if the responsible parent is not incapacitated. This includes IV-D cases in which the responsible parent is a noncustodial mother or a noncustodial father whose affidavit of parentage has been filed with the court or when paternity is not at issue for the child. The court may further order the responsible parent to participate in work activities, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 607, as the court deems appropriate.

Payments ordered for the support of a minor child shall be on a monthly basis, due and payable on the first day of each month. The requirement that orders be established on a monthly basis does not affect the availability of garnishment of disposable earnings based on an obligor’s pay period.The court shall determine the amount of child support payments by applying the presumptive guidelines established pursuant to subsection (c1) of this section. However, upon request of any party, the Court shall hear evidence, and from the evidence, find the facts relating to the reasonable needs of the child for support and the relative ability of each parent to provide support. If, after considering the evidence, the Court finds by the greater weight of the evidence that the application of the guidelines would not meet or would exceed the reasonable needs of the child considering the relative ability of each parent to provide support or would be otherwise unjust or inappropriate the Court may vary from the guidelines. If the court orders an amount other than the amount determined by application of the presumptive guidelines, the court shall make findings of fact as to the criteria that justify varying from the guidelines and the basis for the amount ordered.Payments ordered for the support of a child shall terminate when the child reaches the age of 18 except:

The purpose of the guidelines and criteria shall be to ensure that payments ordered for the support of a minor child are in such amount as to meet the reasonable needs of the child for health, education, and maintenance, having due regard to the estates, earnings, conditions, accustomed standard of living of the child and the parties, the child care and homemaker contributions of each party, and other facts of the particular case. The guidelines shall include a procedure for setting child support, if any, in a joint or shared custody arrangement which shall reflect the other statutory requirements herein.Periodically, but at least once every four years, the Conference of Chief District Judges shall review the guidelines to determine whether their application results in appropriate child support award amounts. The Conference may modify the guidelines accordingly. The Conference shall give the Department of Health and Human Services, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the general public an opportunity to provide the Conference with information relevant to the development and review of the guidelines.

       In the absence of pleading and proof that the circumstances otherwise warrant, the father and mother shall be primarily liable for the support of a minor child, and any other person, agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis shall be secondarily liable for such support. Such other circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, the relative ability of all the above-mentioned parties to provide support or the inability of one or more of them to provide support, and the needs and estate of the child. The judge may enter an order requiring any one or more of the above-mentioned parties to provide for the support of the child as may be appropriate in the particular case, and if appropriate the court may authorize the application of any separate estate of the child to his support. However, the judge may not order support to be paid by a person who is not the child’s parent or an agency, organization or institution standing in loco parentis absent evidence and a finding that such person, agency, organization or institution has voluntarily assumed the obligation of support in writing. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to prevent any court from ordering the support of a child by an agency of the State or county which agency may be responsible under law for such support.

        North Carolina trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over a father’s action seeking modification of a New Jersey trial court’s order requiring the father to pay child support for a mentally retarded child who was born in 1964, after the child and her mother moved to North Carolina and the father moved to Maryland, and the trial court’s judgment that the father’s request for an order terminating his obligation to pay child support had to be granted, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.4(c), was affirmed on appeal.

        Pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, Va. Code Ann. § 20-88.66, the trial court did not err in registering a 1997 North Carolina (N.C.) child support order, which applied the duration term set forth in a 1994 New York (N.Y.) child support order because the 1994 N.Y. order was not modified and remained in full force and effect through the 1997 N.C. order’s saving language; the 1997 N.C. order provided that all provisions of previous orders not modified therein would remain in full force and effect.

        Because a child’s right to support continues unimpaired despite the divorce of his or her parents, the right of a third party provider of goods or services to claim against the noncustodial parent also continues, unimpaired by contracts or judicial decrees or orders affecting the relations between the parents.

       <p>
        The payment of court-ordered child support does not bar a third party from seeking reimbursement directly from a noncustodial parent for “necessaries” provided to that parent’s minor child. However, because the third party provider’s right to recover against the parent is based upon the child’s right to support, the third party provider must still show that the services or goods provided were legal “necessaries” and that the parent against whom relief is sought has failed or refused to provide them. In this context, any payment a noncustodial parent has made for the support of his or her child would be a factor for the trial judge to consider in deciding whether the parent has in fact met the obligation to support that child.

        Although support of a child ordinarily is a parental obligation, other persons standing in loco parentis may also acquire a duty to support the child; thus, in a case where custodial father and child had believed him to be the father of the child, the duty of support should have accompanied the right to custody.

       </p>
       <p>
        As of July 1, 1991, the State adopted guidelines based on income-sharing approach for determining child support. These guidelines were promulgated by Conference of Chief District Judges in accordance with subsection (c1) of this section. Income-sharing formulas ignore problem of attempting to determine cost of raising a child and are based instead on assumption that each parent will contribute all of his or her income to one fund. Then the formulas provide method for equitably dividing income among family members. Income-sharing formulas seeking to equalize financial burden of divorce so that all family members experience about same proportional reduction in standard of living after divorce. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 984 (1990).

        Child Support Guidelines (2002) did not violate substantive due process; the State had a compelling interest in regulating child support obligations, and through establishing a rebuttable presumption with regard to the guidelines under G.S. 50-13.4(c), the act was narrowly drawn.

New presumptive guidelines became effective July 1, 1990. Therefore, at the time, (June 1989) order was entered, trial judge was neither required to follow nor refer to advisory guidelines in order.

        According to the statute, the trial court has the discretion to deviate from the presumptive guidelines in only two situations: (1) when application does not meet or exceeds the reasonable needs of the child; or (2) when application would be unjust or inappropriate.

        A trial court may deviate from the Guidelines when it finds, by the greater weight of the evidence, application of the Guidelines: (1) would not meet or would exceed the reasonable needs of the child considering the relative ability of each parent to provide support; or (2) would be otherwise unjust or inappropriate. Barham v. Barham, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 487 S.E.2d 774, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C.

        Although the trial court properly considered the father’s settlement trust to be non-recurring income when making its child support order, the case was remanded because the trial court failed to make specific findings regarding the reasonable needs of the child when it deviated from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines.

       </p>
       <p>
        North Carolina Child Support Guidelines were inapplicable because the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parents exceeded $20,000; thus, the trial court was required to make a case-by-case determination. Consequently, the trial court was not bound by the Guidelines in determining the father’s child support obligations. Diehl v. Diehl, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C.

        In considering a father’s motion to modify child support, the trial court did not err in deviating only slightly from the guidelines; the guidelines were constitutional, and the slight deviation was not manifestly unsupported by reason.

        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction under G.S. 7B-200(a) over neglect proceedings, and as G.S. 7B-903 authorized the placement of the neglected child with the child’s mother, the trial court had authority under G.S. 7B-904 to order a father to pay child support to the child’s mother; however, further findings were required under G.S. 7B-904(d) and G.S. 50-13.4(c) as to the reasonable needs of the child and the relative ability of the father to provide that amount.

        In utilizing the provision in subsection (e) of this section that payment for the support of a minor child shall be paid by lump sum payment, periodic payments, or by transfer of title or possession of personal property of any interest therein as the court may order, the trial court is vested with broad discretion, and is not limited to ordering any one of the designated methods of payment.

        Separation agreement dealing with the custody and the support of the children of the parties cannot deprive the court of its inherent as well as statutory authority to protect the interests of and provide for the welfare of minors.

        While the court cannot relieve parent of any contractual obligation he assumed to support his child in excess of what the law would require, it can, in the exercise of its inherent and statutory authority to provide for the welfare of minors, order payment of an amount either larger or smaller than that provided for in separation agreement.

       <p>
        In setting amounts for child support, where the trial court sits without a jury, the judge is required to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon and direct the entry of the appropriate judgment. Dishmon v. Dishmon, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 292 S.E.2d 293, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2697 (1982); Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements for findings of fact applicable to orders for alimony are also applicable to the determination of reasonable and adequate child support. Gebb v. Gebb, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 335 S.E.2d 221, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4088 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the requirement that the court make findings
   
   of those specific facts which support its ultimate disposition of the case is to allow a reviewing court to determine from the record whether the judgment, and the legal conclusions which underlie it, represent a correct application of the law. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 316 S.E.2d 99, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3440 (1984).

       <p>
        Effective appellate review of an order entered by a trial court sitting without a jury is largely dependent upon the specificity by which the order’s rationale is articulated. Evidence must support findings; findings must support conclusions; conclusions must support the judgment. Gibson v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C.

       <p>
        The findings of fact in a case for child support, were insufficient to determine whether the trial court gave due regard to the estates of the parties and the case must be remanded for further findings on this matter, even though there was ample evidence contained in the record about the estates of both parties. Sloan v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 360 S.E.2d 816, <cite class="nc_code">19<cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite></cite> LEXIS 3198 (1987).

        Case was remanded for additional fact-finding where the district court failed to identify the presumptive amount of support due under the Guidelines and where there was no analysis of the reasonable needs of the two minor children, other than a finding that plaintiff’s child care costs for one of the children was reasonable. Rowan County DSS v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 776, 522 S.E.2d 590, <cite class="nc_code">1999 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1231 (1999).

        Trial court erred by failing to explain in its findings of fact why it did not award child support from the time of the filing of the paternity and child support complaint; judgment was reversed and case was remanded to trial court for further findings.

        A case involving a motion to modify child support under G.S. 50-13.7, was remanded for further findings of fact because, in entering an order deviating from the North Carolina Child Support Guidelines, the trial court did not make sufficient findings of fact regarding the reasonable needs of the children; the order only made findings regarding health insurance and the fact that the children did not need private schooling.

        Case was remanded for an order addressing the validity of a mother’s request for a deviation from the child support guidelines because the trial court failed to make specific findings regarding the ability of each parent to provide support and the accustomed standard of the living of the children; given the absence of findings of fact, the court of appeals had no way to evaluate the correctness of the trial court’s ruling that the guidelines would meet the reasonable needs of the children. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1339 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s failure to make findings of fact addressing the relative ability of the parents to provide support and the expenses that are needed to meet the children’s needs requires a reviewing court to remand the relevant case to the trial court for the entry of a new order containing additional findings of fact. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1339 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of sufficient factual findings addressing the issue of a mother’s ability to pay for children’s education at a private school, the court of appeals could not determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by requiring her to pay for the cost of the education; the trial court, despite the existence of a request for a deviation from the child support guidelines, did not make any findings addressing the issue of the parties’ relative abilities to pay the cost. Ferguson v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 257, 768 S.E.2d 30, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1339 (2014).

        Trial court had to revisit its calculations of gross income and net income used to determine child support and alimony because it had to make additional findings to support its determination of a husband’s business income, which was used to calculate gross income and determine child support; the trial court also had to make additional findings to account for the husband’s mandatory retirement deduction and his reasonable health insurance expenses in the calculation of his net income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (2019).

        Miscalculation of $736 for the month of December 2016 did not require reversal and remand to the trial court because $736 was less than 2 percent of the total arrears of $52,659, and the parties would likely each incur more than $736 in attorney fees in a remand for the trial court to make that small change to the arrears ordered; the de minimis error did not warrant reversal.

        Adequate findings supported an order requiring a husband to pay children’s private school tuition because (1) findings mandated by the Child Support Guidelines were not required, as the Child Support Guidelines did not apply, and (2) it was found that private school was part of the children’s accustomed standard of living, the parties were able to pay the tuition, and the parties had agreed to privately educate the children.

        Fact that the record contains evidence from which the necessary findings could have been made does not have the effect of absolving the trial court from the obligation to actually make the required findings concerning the needs of the children and the parties’ relative abilities to pay in a case in which a deviation from the guidelines has been requested.

        Trial court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law demonstrated “due regard” to the factors required by subsection (c), and thus, it did not abuse its discretion in the calculation of a father’s child support obligation; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining it would not consider a bonus the mother received, and both parties’ estates were approximately the same, neither was taking distributions from investments, and neither would be required to deplete his or her assets.

       <p>
        Giving “due regard” to the estates of the parties does not require detailed findings as to the value of each individual asset but requires only that the trial court consider the evidence and make sufficient findings addressing its determination regarding the estates to allow appellate review.

        In a child support case, the trial court should be satisfied that personal expenses itemized in the parties’ balance sheets are reasonable under all the circumstances before making a determination of need or liability, and though absence of a specific conclusion as to reasonableness will not necessarily be held for error, the better practice is for the order to contain such a conclusion.

Moreover, where defendant made no attempt to post an undertaking or supersedeas bond to stay civil contempt proceedings on the attorney fee awards pursuant to G.S. 1-289, defendant was subject to civil contempt proceedings pending his appeal.

        When a defendant has the present means to comply with a court order and deliberately refuses to comply, there is a present and continuing contempt, and the court may commit such defendant to jail for an indefinite term, that is, until he complies with the order.

        A dismissal of a contempt action, without explanation, at most signified that the supporting party was not in contempt as of that date and did not cancel the accrued child support debt; it merely forced the custodial parent or an authorized party to pursue one of the alternate remedies listed in subsection (f) to enforce the debt.

         Medical Child Support Enforcement Provisions. —
        </b>
        The medical child support enforcement provisions of House Bill 1563, 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), N.C. Session Laws c. 644, are inapplicable to the North Carolina Teachers’ and State Employees’ Comprehensive Major Medical Plan (now State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees) and the governmental entities whose employees and retirees, along with their dependents, are eligible for coverage under the Plan or its HMO option. Medical child support orders nonetheless may be enforced directly against State employees and retirees who fail to enroll, or maintain coverage for, their eligible dependent children under the State Health Plan in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 50-13.9, 50-13.11 and subsection (f) of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Patricia Crawford, Associate General Counsel, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, — N.C.A.G. — (August 10, 1995).

If an action or proceeding for the custody and support of a minor child has been instituted and an action for annulment or for divorce, either absolute or from bed and board, or for alimony without divorce is subsequently instituted in the same or another county, the court having jurisdiction of the prior action or proceeding may, in its discretion direct that the action or proceeding for custody and support of a minor child be consolidated with such subsequent action, and in the event consolidation is ordered, shall determine in which court such consolidated action or proceeding shall be heard.

       District Court; Denial of Parental Visitation Right; Written Finding of Fact. —  In any case in which an award of child custody is made in a district court, the trial judge, prior to denying a parent the right of reasonable visitation, shall make a written finding of fact that the parent being denied visitation rights is an unfit person to visit the child or that such visitation rights are not in the best interest of the child.

      <li id="t50a01s50-13.5ol1j">
       Custody and Visitation Rights of Grandparents. —  In any action in which the custody of a minor child has been determined, upon a motion in the cause and a showing of changed circumstances pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7, the grandparents of the child are entitled to such custody or visitation rights as the court, in its discretion, deems appropriate. As used in this subsection, “grandparent” includes a biological grandparent of a child adopted by a stepparent or a relative of the child where a substantial relationship exists between the grandparent and the child. Under no circumstances shall a biological grandparent of a child adopted by adoptive parents, neither of whom is related to the child and where parental rights of both biological parents have been terminated, be entitled to visitation rights.

       <p>
        Where the children of the marriage were residents of this State and the parents were personally before the court, the courts of this State had jurisdiction in the wife’s action for subsistence under former G.S. 50-16 to award the custody of the children to the wife and decree the amount defendant should contribute for their support, and to punish defendant as for contempt for willful failure to comply with its order, notwithstanding the fact that the husband obtained a decree of divorce in another state after the entry of the order for support.

        Upon application for the custody of the children of the marriage after decree of divorce, the resident judge entered a temporary order awarding custody to the father, and issued an order to defendant wife to appear outside the county and outside the district to show cause why the temporary order should not be made permanent. It was held that the judge was without jurisdiction to hear the matter outside the district, and an order issued upon the hearing of the order to show cause was void ab initio. Patterson v.

         Nature of Inquiry as to Full Faith and Credit. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to determine whether a custody judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, the court’s inquiry is first confined to whether the judgment sought to be enforced was a final judgment rendered by a court with competent jurisdiction. If the court determines that the foreign judgment was final and was rendered by a court with proper jurisdiction, then the judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, and the court never reaches the merits of the custody action, unless one of the parties asserts that the judgment should be modified due to a substantial change in circumstances. Lynch v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 367</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 840, 1981 N.C. LEXIS 1196 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a court asserts jurisdiction to enforce a custody judgment of another state and no showing of a substantial change of circumstances is made, its jurisdiction terminates upon a final judgment awarding full faith and credit to the sister state’s decree. Lynch v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 367</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 840, 1981 N.C. LEXIS 1196 (1981).

        G.S. 50-13.4 does not identify any time restrictions for making the request for a hearing.

        Where hostilities exist between estranged parents, it may be difficult for the noncustodial parent to maintain a relationship with his or her child when required to exercise visitation only in the presence of the other parent or a member of the other parent’s family who may share such hostilities. There are, of course, circumstances warranting such restrictions, but if they are imposed, they must be based on appropriate factual findings. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C.

Evidence supported the finding that the mother’s behavior had caused the child stress and been deleterious to the child’s well-being so that it was in the best interest of the child that the mother was supervised for extended visits.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by eliminating a father’s access to information because the restriction was based on the specific facts of the case, and the trial court described its rationale in detail; the order was exceptionally detailed, well-organized, and thorough because the trial court noted the factual basis for the restrictions even to obtaining information from third parties and made detailed findings regarding the father’s failure to follow the requirements of prior orders.

       <p>
        There are four statutes in North Carolina which permit a grandparent to maintain an action for custody or visitation of a minor child, and although plaintiff, mother of the deceased father of the two minor children, did not specify under which statute she filed, it was clear that she had no right to proceed under G.S. 50-13.1(a), 50-13.2(b1), 50-13.2A, or under this section.

      In an action or proceeding for the custody or support, or both, of a minor child, including a motion in the cause for the modification or revocation of an existing order for custody or support, or both, the court may in its discretion order payment of reasonable attorney’s fees to an interested party acting in good faith who has insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit. Before ordering payment of a fee in a support action, the court must find as a fact that the party ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding; provided however, should the court find as a fact that the supporting party has initiated a frivolous action or proceeding the court may order payment of reasonable attorney’s fees to an interested party as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.

        Action by intervening grandparents for visitation qualifies as an action for custody, and if that action falls within the scope of G.S. 50-13.6 as an action for the custody, support, or both of a minor child for the purposes of awarding fees to the grandparents, then such an action must also fall within the scope of the statute for purposes of ordering the grandparents to pay; an award of fees against grandparents seeking visitation rights was authorized.

       <p>
        G.S. 50-16.4 and this section permit the entering of a proper order for reasonable counsel fees for the benefit of a dependent spouse, but only where the record contains findings of fact, such as the nature and scope of the legal services rendered and the skill and time required, upon which a determination of the requisite reasonableness could be based. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 183 S.E.2d 420, <cite class="nc_code">1971 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1348 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in failing to make findings of fact as to the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees incurred by the plaintiff after requesting and receiving a detailed affidavit from the plaintiff’s counsel setting forth the nature and scope of the legal services. Rogers v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 635, 251 S.E.2d 663, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2531 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        To support an award of attorneys’ fees, the trial court should make findings as to the lawyer’s skill, his hourly rate, its reasonableness in comparison with that of other lawyers, what he did, and the hours he spent. Falls v. Falls, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 278 S.E.2d 546, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2444 (1981); Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        As this section requires that awards of attorneys’ fees be reasonable, cases construing the statute have in effect annexed a fifth requirement concerning reasonableness onto the express statutory ones; namely, that the record must contain findings of fact upon which a determination of the requisite reasonableness can be based, for example, findings pertaining to the nature and scope of the legal services rendered and the skill and time required. Warner v. Latimer, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 314 S.E.2d 789, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3215 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this section allows for an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, cases construing the statute have in effect annexed an additional requirement concerning reasonableness onto the express statutory ones. Thus, the record must contain additional findings of fact upon which a determination of the requisite reasonableness can be based, such as findings regarding the nature and scope of the legal services rendered, the skill and time required, the attorneys’ hourly rate, and its reasonableness in comparison with that of other lawyers.

       </p>
       <p>
        An order awarding counsel fees in a child support or alimony action must contain a finding or findings upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the award can be based, such as the nature and scope of the legal services rendered, the time and skill required, and the attorney’s hourly rate in comparison to the customary charges of attorneys practicing in that general area.

Attorney fee award was not used as punishment but was based upon mother’s insufficient means to defray expense of suit. Kuttner v. Kuttner, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the father to pay $40,000 of the maternal grandparents’ attorneys’ fee, where the fees were sought because of the father’s failure to cooperate with the grandparents regarding visitation, the father did not object to the evidence offered at trial, and the trial court found that the father had the ability to pay those fees.

        Trial court properly awarded a wife attorneys’ fees under G.S. 50-13.6 following husband’s unsuccessful, frivolous motion for contempt alleging that the wife had failed to give notice of the weeks she intended to have visitation over the summer. Additionally, fees were appropriate because the wife proceeded in good faith and did not have sufficient means to defray the costs. Wiggins v. Bright, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C.

        Entire amount of an arrearage claim and the attorney’s fees owed to dependent former spouse were domestic support obligations as defined in 11 U.S.C.S. § 101(14A), and thus were allowable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 502(b)(5), and entitled to first priority status, under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1)(A). The attorney’s fees had been awarded under G.S. 50-13.6, and the arrearage was allowed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(b)(5). In re Peterson, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 5540 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 29, 2012).

        Trial court properly awarded attorney’s fees to a former wife under the statute because its findings that the wife’s actions were filed in good faith and that she had insufficient means to defray the costs of her action were supported by the wife’s affidavits; the attorney’s fees provision in the separation agreement did not apply because there was no determination of a breach of the agreement or order for specific performance.

       <p>
        Order requiring a husband to pay a wife’s attorney’s fees was not an abuse of discretion because (1) the court properly relied on pleadings and the court record, including uncontested custody and support orders and a motion to continue, (2) disparity of financial resources was not a required consideration, and (3) detailed findings supported the conclusion that the wife was a dependent spouse with insufficient means to defray litigation costs.

        Award of attorney’s fees to a mother was appropriate because, although the parties settled their custody dispute by consent order in a manner more favorable to the father than to what the mother sought, the mother acted in good faith in defending against the father’s child custody and child support claims and in pursuing counterclaims. Moreover, because the father’s monthly income was several times more than the mother’s income, and the mother had recently declared bankruptcy, the mother had insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit. Conklin v. Conklin, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 825 S.E.2d 678, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 189 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the award of attorney’s fees in a free order was not dependent upon the outcome of the contempt proceeding in the underlying custody action, a father’s appeal of the custody order did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to enter the fee order granting a mother attorney’s fees; the trial court’s findings that the the mother acted in good faith and lacked sufficient means to defray the costs of litigation were sufficient to support the award of attorney’s fees.

        A finding of fact supported by competent evidence must be made on the issue of whether the party ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding, in addition to meeting the requirements of “good faith” and “insufficient means,” before attorneys’ fees may be awarded in a support suit. This issue is a question of law, reviewable on appeal. Hudson v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 465</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 719, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 940 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a court can award attorneys’ fees to an interested party under this section in a motion in the cause proceeding for a modification of child support, the court must make the following three findings of fact: (1) the party is acting in good faith; (2) the party has insufficient means to defray the expenses of the suit; and (3) the party ordered to pay support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding.

       <p>
        The text of this section sets out four requirements to support an award of attorneys’ fees, namely: (1) that the party awarded fees be an interested party; (2) that that party be acting in good faith; (3) that that party have insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit; and (4) that the party ordered to furnish support have refused to provide adequate support under the circumstances existing at the time the action was instituted.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the action is one for custody or custody and support, the first sentence of this section applies, and the court may award attorneys’ fees to an interested party if it finds (1) that the party acted in good faith and (2) that the party lacks the means to defray the expense of the suit. Where the action is solely one for support, attorneys’ fees may be awarded provided the court finds, in addition, that the party ordered to furnish support has refused to provide support which is adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of institution of the action or proceeding.

       </p>
       <p>
        In actions for support only, the court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees to a party if it finds: (1) that the party is acting in good faith; (2) that the party has insufficient means to defray the costs of the action; and (3) that the party ordered to pay support had not provided adequate support under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding.

        To award attorneys’ fees in a child support action, the trial court must find as fact that: (1) The interested party (a) acted in good faith and (b) has insufficient means to defray the expenses of the action; and (2) the supporting party refused to provide adequate support “under the circumstances existing at the time of the institution of the action or proceeding.” Moreover, the required findings of fact must in turn be supported by competent evidence, such as that of the parties’ incomes, estates and debts.

        Case would be remanded where trial court failed to make specific findings that: (1) the mother was acting in good faith; (2) the mother’s means were insufficient to defray the expenses of the suit; and (3) the father refused to provide the child support which was adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of the action.

        After the father had been found to be in contempt due to his failure to pay child support, the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support an award of attorney’s fees to the mother under G.S. 50-13.6, despite the fact that there was no finding that the mother was an interested party with insufficient means to defray the cost of the litigation; under
   G.S. 50-13.4(c), the children’s ability to pay attorney’s fees was at issue, not the mother’s, and the mother was an interested party under
   G.S. 50-13.6, as she provided the financial support in the absence of the husband. Belcher v. Averette, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 568 S.E.2d 630, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1069 (2002).

        Mother appeared to have met the statutory requirements but the trial court made no findings on the factors, and thus, the court of appeals could not review the denial of attorney fees; the father refused to provide support adequate under the circumstances existing at the time of institution of the action, and the trial court’s findings had address each of the four statutory factors on remand.

        Trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to a mother following a child custody dispute because, although she testified she would soon be leaving her university position in the following months, the trial court was required to calculate her earnings as they existed at the time of the hearing, not as they would allegedly stand in the future, and, had the trial court correctly calculated the mother’s monthly earnings from employment, the amount would have exceeded her monthly expenses, and the court could not have properly determined whether the mother had “insufficient means” to defray the costs of the suit.

        Trial court order requiring mother to pay $2,500 to the father of the parties’ three minor children was proper because the three children resided with the father, along with his new wife and three other children, the father had inadequate monthly income, and the attorneys’ fees were reasonable. The fees were found to have been increased as a result of the mother’s failure to contribute a reasonable sum to the support of the children after being asked to do so. Roberts v. McAllister, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 621 S.E.2d 191, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2490 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s order for fees met the statutory requirements, as it found that defendant was an interested party acting in good faith and had insufficient means to defray the expense of the suit; in the findings, the trial court noted defendant’s gross income, how he had borne all of the expenses associated with the child while in his primary care, and his attorney filed an affidavit, outlining costs and fees incurred by defendant in the action. Sarno v. Sarno, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 804 S.E.2d 819, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 756 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees for defendant’s response to the petition for writ of mandamus was not manifestly unsupported by reason; although the petition might have been moot, it could not be said that defendant’s filing was wholly unnecessary, and it was in the discretion of the trial court to award fees for this filing. Sarno v. Sarno, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 804 S.E.2d 819, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 756 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering attorneys’ fees because there was evidence to support its determination as to the reasonableness and amount of attorneys’ fees; the mother’s counsel presented evidence of supplemental attorney’s fees and expenses in connection with the matter, and the trial court found the amount reasonable. Simms v. Bolger, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 826 S.E.2d 522, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 211 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Original award of attorneys’ fees was not unreasonable and did not otherwise constitute an abuse of discretion because the trial court noted that the mother had the means and ability to defray a large portion of the expenses of the suit, and the award would be both just and within the father’s ability to pay.

        Trial court had subject-matter jurisdiction under
   G.S. 50A-203(2) to modify a Michigan custody order because North Carolina was the children’s “home state” at the time the custody action was initiated,
   G.S. 50A-102(7), and neither the children nor the mother or father continued to reside in Michigan.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned custody to the parties; in the absence of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child for purposes of modifying an existing custody order.

        It was error to order a father to pay all children’s uninsured medical expenses because neither party asked the court to reevaluate a prior apportionment of such expenses, nor were the expenses subsumed in a prior child support order before the court, since the expenses were separately dealt with, so the trial court had no authority to modify previously agreed support on the court’s own motion.

        When a motion is made to modify the child support provisions of a separation agreement which has not previously been incorporated into an order or judgment of the court, the moving party’s only burden is to show the amount of support necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the child at the time of the hearing, and he is not required to show a change in circumstances. Should the evidence establish, giving due regard to the factors contained in G.S. 50-13.4(b) and (c), that such amount substantially exceeds the amount agreed upon in the separation agreement, such evidence would necessarily rebut the presumption of reasonableness of the amount of child support established in the agreement and establish the need for an increase.

        A separation agreement is terminated for every purpose, insofar as it remains executory, when the parties resume the marital relationship. Among the executory purposes for which a separation agreement is terminated is the payment of child support. But while the courts have held that reconciliation voids alimony provisions, whether in a separation agreement or a court order, this principle has not been applied to void, as a matter of law, a judgment ordering payment of child support.

Thus, when the court adopted the parties’ agreement as to child support as its own determination of the amount of child support to be paid by defendant, this order of support became modifiable in the same manner as any other child support order.

       <p>
        While child support obligations ordered by a court terminate upon the child reaching age 18, unless the child is otherwise emancipated prior to reaching age 18 or the trial court in its discretion continues to enforce the payment obligation after the child reaches age 18 and while the child is in primary or secondary school, when one of two or more minor children for whom support is ordered reaches age 18, and when the support ordered to be paid is not allocated as to each individual child, the supporting parent has no authority to unilaterally modify the amount of the child support payment. The supporting parent must apply to the trial court for modification. Craig v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 406 S.E.2d 656, <cite class="nc_code">1991 N.C.

        Cases holding that where one of two minor children reaches the age of 18, a trial court may retroactively modify child support arrearages when equitable considerations exist which would create an injustice if modification is not allowed, were decided before G.S. 50-13.10 became effective on October 1, 1987. Under this statute, if the supporting party is not disabled or incapacitated, a past due, vested child support payment is subject to divestment only as provided by law, and if, but only if, a written motion is filed, and due notice is given to all parties before the payment is due.

       <p>
        Where parties crossed out a cohabitation provision on the face of their separation memorandum, the trial court only partially discharged its duty in finding that a change of circumstances occurred when husband began cohabiting with his girlfriend because it failed to determine whether plaintiff’s wife had met her burden of showing the effect, if any, such change had upon the welfare of the children.

        Because the trial court carefully laid out in sequential order the facts regarding the father’s relationship with a married woman, resulting in him resigning from his job, and culminating in his separation from his wife who provided at least 50 percent of the minor child’s care, including helping the child with his homework, and then found that the child’s grades had suffered as a result, it provided a nexus between the substantial change in circumstances and the affect on the child’s welfare to overrule the father’s motion to dismiss the mother’s custody modification action; moreover, when balanced against the mother’s attainment of both a stable living environment and a vast improvement in health after suffering from a brain tumor, the trial court’s custody modification order in favor of the mother was upheld.

       <p>
        Where father’s income had decreased from $24,000.00 per month to $2083.33 per month, he had been voluntarily terminated, he had continuously sought employment since being terminated, but those efforts had been impaired due to criminal non-support actions instituted both in Florida and in North Carolina, and his estate had been “substantially depleted,”; although the court failed to use sequentially the words “substantial involuntary reduction” in income, its findings indisputably reflected precisely that. McGee v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 453 S.E.2d 531, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 83 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in modifying original child-support order, where most of its findings of fact were insufficient to support the modification, and the sole valid finding was an increase in father’s annual income.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the changes in circumstances necessary to support a modification should be determined from the date of the most recent child support order which addressed the obligation in question, and an allegation of a change to the parties’ income, without more, was not sufficient to support a motion to modify child support; thus, the ex-husband’s motion to modify child support was properly dismissed.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying a father’s motion for a downward modification of child support under G.S. 50-13.7(a) because the trial court found that the father had incurred no additional cost in covering the child on his wife’s health insurance policy, and no documentation about the insurance was included in the record on appeal; the trial court found that the father’s insurance coverage of the child was unnecessary because the mother had been providing coverage for the child on her policy.

        Although a father was entitled to the presumption of a substantial change in circumstances, in accordance with Child Support Guidelines, N.C. Ann. R. 41 and 46, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not modifying the amount of child support, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7(a), because the presumption was rebutted by evidence the father intentionally left his job, thereby voluntarily depressing his income.

        Under G.S. 50-13.4 and this section, a husband’s ability to pay child support is normally determined by his actual income at the time the award is made or modified. If, however, there is a finding that the husband is deliberately depressing his income or otherwise acting in deliberate disregard of his obligation to provide reasonable support for his child, his capacity to earn may be made the basis of the award. Under these circumstances, his motion to reduce the amount of child support will be denied. Goodhouse v. DeFravio, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 290 S.E.2d 751 (1982).

        Trial court properly increased a father’s child support obligation pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7(a), as the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion that the father retired and voluntarily reduced his income in deliberate disregard of his obligations, based on the fact that the father retired shortly after his wife won a large lottery award, and the trial court therefore properly imputed income to the father pursuant to Child Support Guidelines, N.C.

        Trial court properly granted a mother’s motion, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7, to modify a custody order and granted primary custody of the parties’ two children to the mother; the trial court properly found a substantial change in circumstances based on the father’s interference with the mother’s relationship with the children, the trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to G.S. 50A-202(a), and the trial court properly denied the father’s motions pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 59 and G.S. 1A-1, Rule 60 to stay the order and for a new trial.

        Although doctor recommended that custody should continue with mother, it was not an abuse of discretion for judge to order a change of custody of the child from mother to father where doctor testified that the child had severe emotional problems requiring “substantial immediate change”, that the visitation schedule be limited, and that one parent (mother) exercise more control; the judge agreed with doctor that the child’s problems needed immediate remedy; however, he believed that father was the parent to exercise more control.

        The court’s findings as to child’s poor health and conduct when with defendant mother, and as to her improved state when with plaintiff father, supported by competent evidence as to the child’s conduct, habits, health, schedule, treatment, and response at different times, justified changing the joint custody arrangement that was in force, for these findings indicated changed circumstances that were affecting the welfare of the child.

        The court’s effective determination of a “substantial involuntary reduction” in father’s income was adequate to support its conclusion that there had been a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant modification of previous child support order; thus the court did not err in failing to make findings concerning the actual past expenditures of the minor children prior to reaching its change of circumstances decision.

        In child custody action, findings supported trial court’s conclusion that there had been a substantial change of circumstances since the order where father had consistently attempted to thwart efforts by the defendant to maintain and develop a mother-child relationship with child, where father threatened to stop or disallow visitation by the mother with the child, and where mother’s home life and family situation changed and improved since the order.

        Evidence about child’s psychological state supported judge’s finding of a substantial change of circumstances and the change of custody of the child from the mother to the father where doctor testified that the disappearance of child’s emotional equilibrium occurred during a period when the predominate parental influence upon him was mother and that a possible cause of the child’s problems was his mother’s hostility which centered around the child’s visitations with father, visitations which were often interfered with by mother.

        Modification of a child custody order was in the child’s best interest where the trial court’s findings were adequately supported by the evidence.

        Modification of prior custody order was upheld where the mother’s remarriage exposed the children to alcohol abuse, violent behavior, illegal drugs, and risk of physical harm, thus supporting the trial court’s decision that there was a material and substantial change in circumstances and that modification would be of material benefit and in the children’s best interest.

       <p>
        Prior custody order was properly modified for a substantial change in circumstances under G.S. 50-13.7(a) as the trial court properly considered events after the prior custody order in finding that: (1) a mother had given birth to the child’s sibling; (2) the mother had separated from her husband; (3) the child was in first grade; (4) the child had been diagnosed with and had treatment recommended for ADHD; and (5) the child needed ADHD medication and a father was willing to provide it.

        Trial court did not err in modifying a custody order because its unchallenged findings supported the conclusion that a father met his burden of showing that a change in circumstances actually had occurred and that the changes had affected the welfare of the children; the evidence revealed material changes in the circumstances, with respect to the parties’ comparative stability as well as other considerations, between the time of the hearing resulting in the custody order and the modification proceedings.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying a father’s monthly child support obligation because there had been a substantial change in circumstances since the initial child support order; the father had settled his workers’ compensation and third-party claim, resulting in two large distributions and cessation of his monthly workers’ compensation benefits, the child’s expenses for day care and health insurance, and the child’s expenses for day care and health insurance had increased.

        In a case in which the father had been traveling out of town frequently for his work, his travel schedule was irregular, and he and the mother had serious difficulties in communicating and making arrangements for changes in the child’s schedule, to the child’s detriment, the father’s motion to modify custody was improperly dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the father’s motion to modify alleged at least one substantial change of circumstances as the father was no longer required to travel and was available and able to care for the minor child on an equal basis with the mother. Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 826 S.E.2d 490, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 264 (2019).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err by modifying the custody order because its conclusion of law that there had been a substantial change in circumstances was supported by findings of fact, which were in turn based on competent evidence. The substantial change in circumstances presented by the father justified the trial court’s decision to enter the modification order, including his new job, his new home, the child beginning first grade, the father marrying his girlfriend, and the child’s close relationships with the girlfriend and her stepbrother.

        Except as provided in G.S. 50-13.5(f), the ordinary rule of civil procedure applies to this section, namely, that the first court to acquire jurisdiction of a cause retains jurisdiction, to the exclusion of other courts. Thus, if a judgment involving the custody and the support of a minor child has been entered in this State, the judge trying a subsequent action for absolute divorce may not interfere with the earlier judgment. Only the court of this State which entered the earlier judgment for custody and support of the minor child may modify or vacate it, upon a motion in the cause and a showing of a change of circumstances.

In such a case, the court first obtaining jurisdiction retains jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts and is the only proper court to bring an action for the modification of an order establishing custody and support.

The court’s conclusion of law must be sustained by specific factual findings based upon competent evidence, reflecting the actual amount disbursed by a party within three years or less of the date of filing of the current motion, towards reasonably necessary expenditures made on behalf of the child. The findings also must reflect the ability to pay of the parent subject to the motion during the period for which increased support is sought. Biggs v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C.

       Orders finding a father in contempt for a failure to pay child support were vacated because (1) an agency presented no evidence other than the amount of child support arrears or past public assistance owed, while the father presented substantial evidence of an inability to pay, including the father’s medical condition and minimal living expenses and lack of income, (2) the orders’ findings did not support a conclusion that the father willfully refused to pay or had the ability to pay civil contempt purge payments, (3) nothing showed the father was working at the time of trial, nor was this found, and (4) the trial court did not address how much, if any, regular income the father had or the father’s subsistence living expenses.

Code Ann. § 20-7-1140(A), and the father failed to establish at the contempt hearing that he ever updated his address with the North Carolina Department of Social Services (NCDSS) as required by both court order and State statute, G.S. 50-13.9(c); the father never notified SCDSS of any changes in his address as he was statutorily required to do under S.C. Code Ann. § 63-17-450 by virtue of the child support order, he openly acknowledged at his contempt hearing that he was aware of and was in arrearages on two child support obligations, and notwithstanding his acknowledgment of the two child support cases, the father failed to properly notify either SCDSS or NCDSS of his change in address.

        Modification When One of Several Children Reaches Age 18. —

      </p>
      <p>
       While child support obligations ordered by a court terminate upon the child reaching age 18, unless the child is otherwise emancipated prior to reaching age 18 or the trial court in its discretion continues to enforce the payment obligation after the child reaches age 18 and while the child is in primary or secondary school, when one of two or more minor children for whom support is ordered reaches age 18, and when the support ordered to be paid is not allocated as to each individual child, the supporting parent has no authority to unilaterally modify the amount of the child support payment. The supporting parent must apply to the trial court for modification. Craig v. Craig, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 406 S.E.2d 656, <cite class="nc_code">1991 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Cases holding that where one of two minor children reaches the age of 18, a trial court may retroactively modify child support arrearages when equitable considerations exist which would create an injustice if modification is not allowed, were decided before this section became effective on October 1, 1987. Under this statute, if the supporting party is not disabled or incapacitated as provided by subdivision (a)(2), a past due, vested child support payment is subject to divestment only as provided by law, and if, but only if, a written motion is filed, and due notice is given to all parties before the payment is due.

       It was error to reduce a parent’s child support arrearage by an amount that represented past public assistance paid before the parent knew about the child because that reason did not meet any of the statutory conditions for retroactive reduction.

       Trial court erred by dismissing the father’s motion for modification of child support for failure to state a claim under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because the motion made all the factual allegations required by the standard form under N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 50-13.7 and 50-13.10 and the Child Support Guidelines. There was no requirement for the father’s motion to allege the actual incomes of the parties or any other detailed financial information. Barus v.

As used in this subsection, health insurance for the benefit of the child is considered reasonable in cost if the coverage for the child is available at a cost to the parent that does not exceed five percent (5%) of the parent’s gross income. In applying this standard, the cost is the cost of (i) adding the child to the parent’s existing coverage, (ii) child-only coverage, or (iii) if new coverage must be obtained, the difference between the cost of self-only and family coverage.

       <p>
        The issues of who is a “dependent spouse” and who is a “supporting spouse,” within the meaning of this section, should be decided by the trial judge. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 211 S.E.2d 835, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2470 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial
   
   on the issue of supporting and dependent spouse status, since issues of who is a dependent spouse and who is a supporting spouse are mixed questions of law and fact which can best be determined by the trial judge when he sets the amount of permanent alimony. Vandiver v. Vandiver, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 274 S.E.2d 243, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C.

        A supporting spouse is by definition married to a dependent spouse.

         Procedure Where Grounds for Alimony Are Asserted Simultaneously as Grounds for Divorce. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury to render its verdict on the “fault” issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3857 (1984).

         Consent Judgment Awarding Medical Expenses. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        With the consent of the parties, the trial court, which has general jurisdiction of all domestic matters, could properly enter consent judgment, providing for payment of wife’s medical payments, even though it contained a provision which was outside of the pleadings. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 337 S.E.2d 190, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4297 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under consent judgment in which the court found as a fact that there were no claims for support or alimony pending between the parties and ordered plaintiff to pay all necessary and reasonable medical expenses incurred by defendant, parties did not intend for medical expenses to constitute alimony payments; thus, the trial court erred in entering judgment ex meru motu declaring portions of consent judgment null and void and unenforceable ab initio and in striking them. Davis v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 337 S.E.2d 190, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4297 (1985).

       <p>
        The legislative intent in the use of the phrase “actually substantially dependent” in subdivision (4) of this section is clear. This term implies that the spouse seeking alimony must have actual dependence on the other in order to maintain standard of living in the manner to which that spouse had become accustomed during the last several years prior to separation. Thus, to qualify as a “dependent spouse” under subdivision (3) of this section, one must be actually without the means of providing for his or her accustomed standard of living. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 174</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 849, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 919 (1980); Knott v. Knott, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C.

        The term “accustomed standard of living of the parties”
   
   in G.S. 50-16.5(a) completes the contemplated legislative meaning of “maintenance and support” in subdivision (3) of this section. The latter phrase clearly means more than a level of mere economic survival. Plainly it contemplates the economic standard established by the marital partnership for the family unit during the years in which the marital contract was intact. It anticipates that alimony, to the extent it can possibly do so, shall sustain that standard of living for the dependent spouse to which the parties together became accustomed. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 174</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 849, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 919 (1980); Knott v. Knott, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C.

        Determination that one is a “dependent spouse” within the meaning of subdivision (3) of this section is a consequence of two or more related propositions taken as premises, one being the fact that the relationship of spouse exists, and the other consisting of at least the finding that one of the two alternatives in subdivision (3) is a fact.

       </p>
       <p>
        To find that one is a dependent spouse the trial court must make findings of fact sufficient to show (1) that a marital relationship between the parties exists; (2) either (a) that the spouse is actually substantially dependent upon the other spouse for his or her maintenance and support, or (b) that the spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse; and (3) that the supporting spouse is capable of making the payments required.

       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether one qualifies as a dependent spouse under subdivision (3) of this section, as well as in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the courts must consider the factors enumerated in G.S. 50-16.5, the section for determining the amount of alimony. These factors include the estates, earnings, earning capacity, condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, and other facts of the particular case. Beaman v.

       <p>
        If the court determines that one spouse is not actually dependent on the other for such support, the court must then determine if one spouse is “substantially in need of maintenance and support” from the other, i.e., whether one spouse would be unable to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living, established prior to separation, without financial contribution from the other. In doing so, the court must determine and consider the following: (1) The standard of living, socially and economically, to which the parties as a family unit became accustomed during the several years prior to their separation; (2) the present earnings, prospective earning capacity, and any other condition, such as health, of each spouse at the time of the hearing; (3) whether the spouse seeking alimony has a demonstrated need for financial contribution from the other spouse in order to maintain the parties’ accustomed standard of living, taking into consideration the spouse’s reasonable expenses in light of that standard of living; and (4) the financial worth or “estate” of both spouses. The court must also consider fault and other facts of the particular case such as the length of the marriage and the contribution made by each spouse to the financial status of the family over the years.

        Even if a spouse is not actually substantially dependent, he or she is nevertheless a dependent spouse under the second part of the definition of subdivision (3) of this section if, considering the parties’ earnings, earning capacity, estates, and other factors, the spouse seeking alimony demonstrates the need for financial contribution from the other spouse to maintain his or her accustomed standard of living.

        The conclusions made by the court as to whether a spouse is “dependent” or “supporting” must be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to indicate that the court properly considered the factors. In the absence of such findings, appellate courts cannot appropriately determine whether the order of the trial court is adequately supported by competent evidence, and therefore such an order must be vacated and the case remanded for necessary findings. It is not enough that there is evidence in the record from which such findings could have been made because it is for the trial court, and not the appellate court, to determine what facts are established by the evidence.

   for alimony or alimony pendente lite. Loflin v. Loflin, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 212 S.E.2d 403, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2185 (1975).

        This section looks first to the ability of the spouses to maintain the standard of living to which they have become accustomed during the last years of the marriage. The burden on the applicant for alimony is to show the accustomed standard of living and lack of means to maintain that standard. Only then does the ability of the other spouse to pay become significant. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C.

        Trial court’s conclusion that plaintiff wife was the “dependent spouse” entitled to support was not supported by findings of fact where the court found that defendant husband’s income was “very significantly lower than same [had] been in the past” and also that plaintiff was “unable to continue to maintain her accustomed station in life,” but there was no finding or evidence that defendant deliberately depress his income in an effort to avoid his obligations, and it was apparent that the trial court disregarded defendant’s own inability to maintain the station in life to which he was formerly accustomed in its determination of dependency.

        Where the uncontradicted evidence disclosed that the year before the parties separated, the plaintiff had an income of $18,339.97 and the defendant had an income of $20,475.11, and the year they separated, the plaintiff’s income was $19,301.46 and the defendant’s income was $24,447.26, and that during the last year that they lived together, they maintained separate bank accounts and divided household expenses, evidence did not support the ultimate finding that the plaintiff was substantially and materially dependent upon the defendant for her support and maintenance, and the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff alimony.

        Trial court did not err by finding wife’s pleadings were insufficient on their face and dismissing her action for alimony pendente lite; plaintiff asserted in her complaint that she was a “dependent spouse,” but the only support she offered for this conclusion was evidence of her husband’s salary and she did not present any evidence that she needed assistance to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit.

         “Supporting Spouse” Defined. —

       </p>
       <p>
        A “supporting spouse” is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent or from whom such other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. A spouse meets the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for “dependent spouse.” The primary issue is not the supporting spouse’s ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking alimony is a dependent spouse. Long v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 322 S.E.2d 427, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3857 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination that one is a “supporting spouse”
   
   within the meaning of subdivision (4) of this section is a consequence of two or more related propositions taken as premises, one being that the relationship of spouse exists, and the other consisting of the finding that one of the three (now two) alternatives in subdivision (4) is a fact.

     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the year 1872 there was no statute regulating the question of alimony without divorce, but in this State it was held that this relief in proper cases could be granted by courts of equity. See Crews v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 168</cite>, 95 S.E. 149 (1918). By Laws 1872, c. 193, the legislature provided for this relief, but in that act there was no provision whereby the wife could obtain alimony during the determination of the issues involved in her suit. See Hodges v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 122</cite> (1880). In 1919, an amendment was added whereby the wife might apply for an allowance for her subsistence during the pendency of her main action. See Laws 1919, c. 24.

Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 507 S.E.2d 317, <cite class="nc_code">1998 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1354 (1998).

      <p>
       Trial court was not required to find a change of circumstances in entering an alimony order in a divorce case because at the time of the hearing, the only order in effect was a postseparation support order; the alimony award thus did not “modify” a prior alimony order, but rather terminated an existing temporary postseparation support. Langdon v. Langdon, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 644 S.E.2d 600, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1106 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court failed to make factual findings as to the parties’ financial needs, accustomed standard of living, separate and marital debt obligations, and the expenses reasonably necessary to support each of them, its post-separation support and alimony awards to the husband under G.S. 50-16.3A(a), (b), and (c) were reversed.

       Trial court erred in its calculation of a wife’s income because it calculated her average net income even though there was no evidence in the record to suggest that she was depressing her income; if the trial included post-separation support (PSS) the wife received from the husband, that would also constitute error, because (PSS), which eventually terminated upon the occurrence of specified events, was not permanent income.

       Where the trial court found that the ex-husband had a net monthly income of approximately $5,400 and reasonable monthly expenses in the amount of $4,200, yielding a surplus of $1,200, and the ex-wife’s reasonable needs exceeded her income by $1,400, there was no abuse of discretion in finding the ex-wife was a dependent spouse and the ex-husband was a supporting spouse and awarding the ex-wife $1,200 per month in alimony.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported the finding that the wife was a dependent spouse and the husband was a supporting spouse pursuant to G.S. 50-16.1A, where the findings of fact demonstrated that, during the marriage and at the time of the hearing, the wife had an income-expenses deficit of $627.00 per month and the husband had an income-expense surplus.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a wife’s motion to dismiss a husband’s alimony claim on the grounds that he failed to reply to the wife’s counterclaims because the allegations set forth in the wife’s counterclaims, and reiterated in a finding of fact in the trial court’s order, were merely denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, and the trial court erred in deeming admitted the allegations in the wife’s counterclaim that the husband was not a dependent spouse and that he was not a supporting spouse; a plaintiff is not required to re-allege those allegations in a complaint that have been “denied in the affirmative” by way of a counterclaim by a defendant. Crowley v. Crowley, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 691 S.E.2d 727, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 559 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by determining a wife was not a “dependent spouse” for purposes of alimony, G.S. 50-16.1A(2) and G.S. 50-16.3A(a), because there was a surplus left to the wife each month, after deducting all of the wife’s expenses from her net monthly income; the wife’s “change in lifestyles” argument in support of alimony was rejected because the wife’s previous standard of living was “artificially inflated” by a massive infusion of debt.

       It was not error to find a wife was a dependent spouse and a husband was a supporting spouse, for post-separation support, because the court sufficiently found the parties’ incomes and marital living standard.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in concluding that a wife was not a dependent spouse because it failed to determine which, if any, of the wife’s expenditures were reasonable in light of her accustomed standard of living during the parties’ marriage and to engage in the necessary comparison of those reasonable expenses to a correct calculation of her income. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 98 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the trial court heard both the alimony claim and the equitable distribution claims simultaneously, it had to determine the final equitable distribution prior to determining alimony; presuming the record supported the wife’s contention that the husband was a supporting spouse, the trial court had to determine whether the husband was a supporting spouse if it concludes on remand that the wife was a dependent spouse.

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in finding a husband and wife were not separated at the time of the wife’s marital misconduct, as defined in G.S. 50-16.1A(3)(a), thereby precluding an award of alimony to the wife under G.S. 50-16.3A(a), because even though there was some physical separation of the parties after a choking incident involving the parties’ son, neither party expressed to the other they wanted to separate and the husband continued to maintain all of his belongings at the marital residence; although the phrase “the date of separation” as used in G.S. 50-16.3A(a) was not defined, the phrase “separate and apart” as used in G.S. 50-6 meant there had to be a physical separation and an intention on the part of at least one of the parties to cease matrimonial cohabitation. Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d 308, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2051 (2011).

        Finding of Marital Misconduct as Related to Alimony. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where trial court specifically found, while addressing the alimony issue, that despite the marital misconduct of the wife, she should be given credit for her career sacrifices that no doubt helped the husband succeed in his military goals, the trial court thereby fully addressed the question of the wife’s misconduct as it related to alimony. Cunningham v. Cunningham, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 615 S.E.2d 675, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1371 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a husband admitted to marital misconduct, in the form of breaking his wife’s arm, and physically and verbally abusing the parties’ minor children, a trial court properly determined the wife was not entitled to alimony under G.S. 50-16.3A(a) because the wife had engaged in uncondoned illicit sexual behavior with another man, G.S. 50-16.1A(3)(a), including sexual intercourse or sexual acts, as defined in G.S. 14-27.1(4). Romulus v. Romulus, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 715 S.E.2d 308, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2051 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a wife had to show a lack of adequate provocation for a husband’s indignities, for alimony purposes, any failure to satisfy this requirement did not warrant reversal of an alimony award because (1) the husband did not raise the issue below, (2) the husband did not show provocation, and (3) the trial court’s findings demonstrated that the wife did not provoke the husband’s abuse. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 754 S.E.2d 831, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 179 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Competent evidence showed a husband subjected a wife to indignities because a guardian ad litem report, to which the husband did not object for alimony purposes, demonstrated such indignities. Dechkovskaia v. Dechkovskaia, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 754 S.E.2d 831, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 179 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied a wife’s request for post-separation support based on marital misconduct because the wife abandoned the husband by discontinuing the marital cohabitation without just cause or excuse, leaving the marital home, depositing the husband’s belongings at their son’s house, and telling the husband that she had found someone else and did not want him anymore, and the husband’s failure to object did not constitute consent. Sorey v. Sorey, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 682, 757 S.E.2d 518, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 417 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband’s motion to dismiss a wife’s claim that he had engaged in “marital misconduct” was not properly presented by his appeal; where an unsuccessful motion to dismiss is grounded on an alleged insufficiency of the facts to state a claim for relief, and the case proceeds to judgment on the merits, the unsuccessful movant cannot on an appeal from the final judgment seek review of the denial of the motion to dismiss. Gilmartin v. Gilmartin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 822 S.E.2d 771, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1268 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported the trial court’s findings of fact regarding indignities, and it properly did not make any findings regarding condonation of the indignities because the husband did not present any evidence that the wife ever had sufficient knowledge of his actions to condone them; when the wife became aware of husband’s actions she objected and asked him to stop, but he continued his behavior surreptitiously. Gilmartin v. Gilmartin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 822 S.E.2d 771, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1268 (2018).

       Reversal and remand of a trial court’s order was appropriate because the court had to enter additional findings concerning the parties’ expenses as the court’s alimony order did not include any findings as to the wife’s expenses. Kabasan v. Kabasan, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 810 S.E.2d 691, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 62 (2018).

        While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury to render its verdict on the “fault” issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony.

In doing so, the court must determine and consider the following: (1) The standard of living, socially and economically, to which the parties as a family unit became accustomed during the several years prior to their separation; (2) the present earnings, prospective earning capacity, and any other condition, such as health, of each spouse at the time of the hearing; (3) whether the spouse seeking alimony has a demonstrated need for financial contribution from the other spouse in order to maintain the parties’ accustomed standard of living, taking into consideration the spouse’s reasonable expenses in light of that standard of living; and (4) the financial worth or “estate” of both spouses. The court must also consider fault and other facts of the particular case such as the length of the marriage and the contribution made by each spouse to the financial status of the family over the years.

A spouse meets the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for “dependent spouse.” The primary issue is not the supporting spouse’s ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking alimony is a dependent spouse.

        One spouse may abandon the other without physically leaving the home. In that event, the physical departure of the other spouse from the home is not an abandonment by that spouse. The constructive abandonment by the defaulting spouse may consist of either affirmative acts of cruelty or of a willful failure, as by a willful failure to provide adequate support. Panhorst v.

       </p>
       <p>
        There is no willful failure, and thus no constructive abandonment, where the defect of which the departing spouse complains is due to the illness or physical disability of the remaining spouse and his or her consequent inability to act.

        A wife is entitled to her husband’s society and the protection of his name and home in cohabitation.

        A husband may be deemed to have abandoned his wife within the meaning of G.S. 50-7(1), and thus be liable for alimony, notwithstanding the fact that, after cohabitation is brought to an end, he voluntarily provides her with adequate support. Whether his withdrawal from the home, followed by such support, constitutes an abandonment which is ground for suit by the wife for divorce from bed and board, and therefore ground for suit by her for alimony without divorce, depends upon whether his withdrawal from the home was justified by the conduct of the wife.

       <p>
        In cases involving alimony without divorce on the grounds that the supporting spouse has offered such indignities to the dependent spouse as to render his or her condition intolerable and his or her life burdensome, the Supreme Court has not set an undeviating rule as to what constitutes such indignities, but leaves it to the courts to deal with each particular case and to determine it upon its own peculiar circumstances. Presson v. Presson, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 182 S.E.2d 614, <cite class="nc_code">1971 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1295 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        While husband often neglected his wife while participating in rescue squad activities,
   
   and on occasion called her names in public, thus contributing to his wife’s suspicions and irritation, his conduct was not such as to cause her condition to become intolerable and her life burdensome. Furthermore, the husband did not abandon his wife, but left the marital residence for “just cause” (wife’s criticism and accusations). Therefore, the wife was not entitled to alimony as a matter of law. Puett v. Puett, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 331 S.E.2d 287, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3675 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the wife is compelled to leave the home of the husband because he offers such indignities
   
   to her person as to render her condition intolerable and her life burdensome, his acts constitute in law an abandonment of the wife by the husband, and allegations to this effect are sufficient to state a cause of action for alimony without divorce. Barwick v. Barwick, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 109</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 597, 1947 N.C. LEXIS 556 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        A wife is not always entitled to alimony when her husband “threatens” her,
   
   however mildly, on several occasions. Traywick v. Traywick, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 221 S.E.2d 85, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2667 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sexual cohabitation after acts of cruelty cannot be considered as condonation
   
   in the sense in which it would be after an act of adultery. The effort to endure unkind treatment as long as possible is commendable; and it is obviously a just rule that the patient endurance by one spouse of the continuing ill treatment of the other should never be allowed to weaken his or her right to relief under subdivision (7) of this section. Privette v. Privette, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 227 S.E.2d 137, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2243 (1976).

        Where the complaint merely alleges that the defendant treated the plaintiff cruelly and offered indignities to her person but does not refer to any transactions, occurrences or series of transactions or occurrences intended to be proved, nor mention any specific act of cruelty or indignity committed by the defendant, the alleged cruelty and alleged indignities may consist of nothing more than occasional nagging of the plaintiff or pounding on a table.

        Separation Required for Claim of Postseparation Support. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court correctly dismissed a wife’s claim for spousal support based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, in order to maintain a claim for postseparation support under G.S. 50-16.2A, the parties had to be separated, and the record showed that the parties were still married and living in the marital residence with their minor children.

       Although a trial court, in determining alimony, properly considered a wife’s present employment income, in accordance with G.S. 50-16.2A(b), and not the wife’s expected decrease in pay, the trial court erroneously included the wife’s tax refund in the calculation of her regular income.

      </p>
      <p>
       Summary judgment was appropriate
   
   where a premarital agreement signed by the parties irrefutably barred the wife’s claims for postseparation support, alimony and equitable distribution; the language in the subject agreement—drafted by the wife’s attorney—was sufficiently “express” to constitute a valid and enforceable waiver of the wife’s claims for postseparation support pursuant to G.S. 50-16.2A and alimony pursuant to G.S. 50-16.3A.

       Findings of fact and conclusion of law in a civil contempt order were insufficient. The trial court had failed to make findings regarding G.S. 5A-21(a)(1) and (2); there were no findings regarding defendant’s present ability to pay postseparation support; and the statement that the support order was interlocutory was not a conclusion of law.

      <p>
       When the trial court ordered defendant to either pay plaintiff $400 or serve thirty days in jail for willfully refusing to pay postseparation support to plaintiff, the action was for defendant’s failure to comply with the trial court’s previous order, and it was evident that the trial court was exercising its contempt power to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order.

      It was formerly held that alimony pendente lite could not be awarded in the absence of a statute conferring this power. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 377</cite> (1837); Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite> (1880). In 1852, the legislature passed an act authorizing the courts, upon a petition for divorce and alimony, to decree the petitioner a sum sufficient for her support during the pendency of the suit. See Everton v. Everton, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 202</cite> (1857). In Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), the court overruled the former doctrine mentioned above, and stated that the courts possessed the right to grant alimony pendente lite by virtue of the common law, the practice having come down from the English ecclesiastical courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effect of this holding was to make the statute remedial in its nature, affirmative in its terms and cumulative in its effect, not abrogating the common law existent on the subject nor withdrawing from the court any powers already possessed in administering its principles. Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), overruling Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite> (1880), on this point.

        Defendant’s contention that the provisions of former G.S. 50-16 empowering the court to allow subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite to plaintiff in her action for alimony without divorce were unconstitutional as depriving him of a property right without trial by jury was untenable, since he was under the duty to support plaintiff until the adjudication of issues relieving him of that duty, and since such allowance by the court did not form any part of the ultimate relief sought nor affect the final rights of the parties.

        Purpose of alimony pendente lite
   
   is to give a dependent spouse immediate support and allow her to maintain her action. Giving supporting spouse credit for equitable distribution purposes for various payments made as part of alimony pendente lite would defeat the purpose of alimony pendente lite by penalizing the dependent spouse in the final distribution of the marital assets. Morris v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 367 S.E.2d 408, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 371, disapproved, Armstrong v.

        Since the decision to the contrary in Reeves v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 348</cite> (1980), is expressly abrogated in Medlin v. Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 529</cite>, 95 S.E. 857 (1918), the wife (dependent spouse) may be allowed alimony pending the action and counsel fees in a suit against her for divorce, even though she seeks no affirmative relief and merely endeavors to defeat her husband’s (supporting spouse’s) case. It follows, therefore, that in an action by the husband for an absolute divorce, the wife may deny the validity of the cause of action alleged by the husband, or plead an affirmative defense to it, and obtain upon a proper showing in either event allowances from the estate or earnings of the husband for her support during the pendency of the action and for counsel fees for her attorneys. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 383</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 109, 1953 N.C. LEXIS 530 (1953).

       <p>
        When the husband (supporting spouse) sues the wife (dependent spouse) for an absolute divorce, the wife may plead a cause of action for divorce from bed and board as a cross-action, and obtain upon a proper showing allowances from the estate or earnings of her husband for her support during the pendency of the action and for counsel fees for her attorneys.

       <p>
        In order to obtain alimony pendente lite, the applicant must be (1) a dependent spouse, (2) entitled to the relief demanded in the action, and (3) without sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof.

       <p>
        This section establishes the requirements for an award of alimony pendente lite. In the first place, the applicant must be a dependent spouse. Once it is established that the applicant is a dependent spouse it must appear that such spouse: (1) Prima facie, is entitled to the relief demanded in the action, i.e., absolute divorce, divorce from bed and board, annulment, or alimony without divorce; and (2) Does not have sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof.

       </p>
       <p>
        To obtain alimony pendente lite, the dependent spouse must show, among other things, that he or she is entitled to the relief demanded by such spouse in the action in which the application for alimony pendente lite is made, and that he or she has not sufficient means whereon to subsist during the prosecution or defense of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof.

       <p>
        In order for a spouse to be entitled to alimony pendente lite under this section, the trial court must make findings of fact to show three requirements: (1) the existence of a marital relationship; (2) that the spouse is either (a) actually or substantially dependent upon the other spouse for maintenance and support, or (b) is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse; and (3) that the supporting spouse is capable of making the required payments.

       In the claim for alimony, either spouse may request a jury trial on the issue of marital misconduct as defined in G.S. 50-16.1A. If a jury trial is requested, the jury will decide whether either spouse or both have established marital misconduct.

       Trial court erred in granting a wife’s motion to dismiss a husband’s alimony claim on the grounds that he failed to reply to the wife’s counterclaims because the allegations set forth in the wife’s counterclaims, and reiterated in a finding of fact in the trial court’s order, were merely denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, and the trial court erred in deeming admitted the allegations in the wife’s counterclaim that the husband was not a dependent spouse and that he was not a supporting spouse; a plaintiff is not required to re-allege those allegations in a complaint that have been “denied in the affirmative” by way of a counterclaim by a defendant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because there was no counterclaim for alimony in a wife’s answer to a husband’s complaint, but there were three specific counterclaims that incorporated by reference and re-alleged those portions of the answer that related to alimony, the wife did assert counterclaims to which a reply would generally be required; however, a plaintiff’s failure to file a reply re-asserting allegations already made in the complaint in response to averments in a defendant’s counterclaim, which do no more than present denials in affirmative form of the allegations of the complaint, does not amount to an admission pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 8(d). Crowley v. Crowley, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 691 S.E.2d 727, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 559 (2010).

      <p>
       Trial court did not err by determining a wife was not a “dependent spouse” for purposes of alimony, G.S. 50-16.1A(2) and G.S. 50-16.3A(a), because there was a surplus left to the wife each month, after deducting all of the wife’s expenses from her net monthly income; the wife’s “change in lifestyles” argument in support of alimony was rejected because the wife’s previous standard of living was “artificially inflated” by a massive infusion of debt.

      <p>
       An alimony claim made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and filed within one year of plaintiff’s dismissal of her first claim (under repealed G.S. 50-16.6(a)) failed to qualify as “a new action based on the same claim” under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 41(a)(1), because the claim for alimony under this section was distinct from that set out by the repealed section in that it deferred to the court’s discretion the decision of whether to award alimony where both the supporting and dependent spouse “each participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior,” whereas the old section foreclosed a dependent spouse from recovering.

      <p>
       The trial court did not abuse its discretion by characterizing the funds reflecting a marital pattern of savings as a reasonable expense where defendant was still employed and had a comfortable and significantly higher income than plaintiff, who was not working, but the trial court’s inclusion of this investment income amount as an expense for the plaintiff but not for the defendant did constitute an abuse of discretion.

      <p>
       It was error to award, as a component of alimony, a sum to enable a wife to accumulate savings because (1) this was not the purpose of alimony, and (2) a sum the parties contributed to savings on a monthly basis during the marriage was not found, and (3) the court did not factor in the savings as a monthly expense of the wife in calculating the wife’s reasonable monthly expenses.

       Certainly, there is no requirement that one spouse enjoy the same lifestyle as the other spouse’s current lifestyle, but the trial court must consider the accustomed standard of living developed during the marriage in determining one spouse’s reasonable need for support.

        Findings of Fact. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of fact required to support the amount, duration, and manner of payment of an alimony award are sufficient if findings of fact have been made on the ultimate facts at issue in the case and the findings of fact show the trial court properly applied the law in the case; however, the findings of fact need not set forth the weight given to the factors in subsection (b) by the trial court when determining the appropriate amount, duration, and manner of payment, as the weight given the factors is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Friend-Novorska v. Novorska, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 545 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2001 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 302, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 564</cite>, 556 S.E.2d 294, 2001 N.C. LEXIS 1238 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand was required where a trial court, while making sufficient ultimate findings of fact to support an award of permanent alimony, failed to state findings of fact as to the reasoning for the duration of the award and the manner of payment. Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 588 S.E.2d 517, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2196 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the trial court’s findings were sufficiently specific to indicate that the trial judge properly considered each of the statutory factors, the alimony award was improper because the trial court made no findings with respect to the wife’s medical benefits or potential income from her IRA, as required by G.S. 50-16.3A(b)(4) although evidence of the sources of income was presented at the hearing; without such findings, it was not known where the trial court properly considered the factor. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 647 S.E.2d 481, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1735 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 171</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 350, 2008 N.C. LEXIS 27 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s findings of fact were more than sufficient to demonstrate the court’s consideration of the statutory factors under G.S. 50-16.3A because the court considered: (1) the duration of the parties’ marriage; (2) the status of the parties’ minor children; (3) the parties’ ages and education levels; (4) the parties’ relative incomes and earning capacities; (5) the parties’ expenses, debts, and financial obligations; (6) the parties’ standard of living; and (7) the marital misconduct of one of the parties. Hartsell v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 657 S.E.2d 724, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 428 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court failed to make factual findings as to the parties’ financial needs, accustomed standard of living, separate and marital debt obligations, and the expenses reasonably necessary to support each of them, its post-separation support and alimony awards to the husband under G.S. 50-16.3A(a), (b), and (c) were reversed. Crocker v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 660 S.E.2d 212, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 874 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient findings supported a trial court’s award of retroactive alimony to a former wife because the court’s findings regarding the amount, duration, and manner of payment were set out in its February 2012 order, while an April 2012 order simply awarded the wife alimony for a time period that was inadvertently omitted from the February order, and reading the two orders together supported the entirety of the award; the statute authorized the trial court to award retroactive alimony. Smallwood v. Smallwood, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 742 S.E.2d 814, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 542 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In its order awarding alimony, the trial court made findings of fact addressing all 16 statutory factors before concluding that the wife was entitled to an award of alimony lasting for two years; the trial court stated that it considered the wife’s affair and resulting disrespect for and mistreatment of the marriage in reaching its alimony decision, and this finding was sufficient to explain the trial court’s reasoning in awarding alimony for only two years, plus the trial court made other findings that could also support its decision, which was affirmed. Ellis v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 767 S.E.2d 413, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1343 (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alimony award erred because the trial court’s findings of fact were limited to the parties’ incomes and expenses in various prior years, instead of considering all competent evidence of all statutory factors. Collins v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 778 S.E.2d 854, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 904 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court acted within its discretion in calculating a husband’s total reasonable needs and expenses based on the record evidence because its specific findings as to the total expenses were attached and incorporated by reference as an exhibit, which detailed and confirmed the total expenses. Burger v. Burger, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 790 S.E.2d 683, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 872 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversal and remand of a trial court’s order was appropriate because the court had to enter additional findings concerning the parties’ expenses as the court’s alimony order did not include any findings as to the wife’s expenses. Kabasan v. Kabasan, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 810 S.E.2d 691, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 62 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of fact was simply a comparison of the relative assets and liabilities of the spouses as required the statute, and as there was competent evidence to support the finding, the husband’s challenge was overruled. Rea v. Rea, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 822 S.E.2d 426, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1140 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the incomplete transcript, the court of appeals could review the sufficiency of the evidence, because the order on appeal had findings of fact on some of the alimony factors, the court of appeals assumed they were supported by the evidence; since findings for a particular factor were only required if evidence was presented on that factor, the court of appeals also had to assume the trial court made findings addressing all of the factors for which evidence was presented. Gilmartin v. Gilmartin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 822 S.E.2d 771, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1268 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court did not set forth its reasons for the amount and duration of its alimony award, the matter was remanded for further findings. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court had to revisit its calculations of gross income and net income used to determine child support and alimony because it had to make additional findings to support its determination of a husband’s business income, which was used to calculate gross income and determine child support; the trial court also had to make additional findings to account for the husband’s mandatory retirement deduction and his reasonable health insurance expenses in the calculation of his net income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of fact were sufficient to meet statutory requirements; the trial court found defendant was not dependent on plaintiff for maintenance as she had substantial unearned income in the form of the life insurance proceeds, and the trial court relied on the same findings the court used to distribute property as the court required consideration of similar factors. The trial court did not simply disqualify defendant from receiving alimony based solely on her ability to support herself through estate depletion. Crago v. Crago, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 834 S.E.2d 700, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 876 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was unclear how the trial court reached the court’s amount of prospective alimony, and even based on the trial court’s findings, it appeared the wife had greater reasonable needs than $ 1,200.00 per month and the husband had the ability to pay substantially more; the only issue was the wife’s reasonable needs based upon the accustomed standard of living established during the marriage, and the order of prospective alimony was vacated and remanded for additional findings. Myers v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 837 S.E.2d 443, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 18 (2020).

      <p>
       Actual findings by the trial court were insufficiently detailed

      <p>
       Since the trial court heard both the alimony claim and the equitable distribution claims simultaneously, it had to determine the final equitable distribution prior to determining alimony; on remand, the trial court had to first determine the equitable distribution matters prior to considering the alimony issues since the distribution could potentially change the financial circumstances of the parties including the need for or ability to pay alimony.

       There was no evidence to support the trial court’s conclusion that the husband would pick up additional business to offset established income losses of some $80,000 per year; thus, the court incorrectly determined the husband’s income for alimony purposes. Glass v. Glass, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 784, 509 S.E.2d 236, <cite class="nc_code">1998 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1556 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in its calculation of a wife’s income because it calculated her average net income even though there was no evidence in the record to suggest that she was depressing her income; if the trial court imputed income to the wife on the basis of earning capacity, its calculation of her income would constitute error, and if it included post-separation support (PSS) the wife received from the husband, that would also constitute error, because (PSS) was not permanent income. Carpenter v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 781 S.E.2d 828, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 98 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly determined a wife’s income in accordance with the record evidence because the wife had consistently received bonuses for the past four years; the wife based her most recent financial affidavit in part on her gross monthly income, but she admitted that her bonus for that year totaled around $ 41,000.

      </p>
      <p>
       Husband’s ability to pay alimony was not sufficiently found because, rather than finding the husband’s current income, the court based an alimony award on an average of the husband’s income in two prior years. Green v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 806 S.E.2d 45, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 801 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because personal expenses were included as business deductions and accounted for in the business tax returns used to determine a husband’s income from a business, the trial court did not err in excluding them from the living expenses; including the personal expenses as separate living expenses after they were considered in determining income from the business would result in “double dipping.” Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court abused its discretion in failing to factor a husband’s law enforcement officer (LEO) retirement into net income calculations and in believing it was voluntary because the LEO was a mandatory deduction from the husband’s income, making that portion of his income unavailable to him to pay towards alimony; the trial court should have accounted for the mandatory deduction it its calculation of the husband’s net income. Wise v. Wise, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 826 S.E.2d 788, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a deduction for a husband’s law enforcement officer retirement was mandatory, and those funds were not available to the husband to pay alimony, the trial court’s failure to account for the mandatory deduction was not supported by reason and amounted to an abuse of discretion; at the very least, the trial court had to make further findings setting forth the reasons why the retirement was not factored into its calculations.

       Trial court’s findings supported its decision to use prior years’ income from a business in the calculation of gross income for the determinations of alimony and child support because the trial court questioned whether the husband’s reported income accurately represented his income from the business; the trial court found that the husband’s reported income was not credible.

       Even though a husband admitted to marital misconduct, in the form of breaking his wife’s arm, and physically and verbally abusing the parties’ minor children, a trial court properly determined the wife was not entitled to alimony under G.S. 50-16.3A(a) because the wife had engaged in uncondoned illicit sexual behavior with another man, G.S. 50-16.1A(3)(a), including sexual intercourse or sexual acts, as defined in G.S. 14-27.1(4).

       Statute clearly bars alimony for a dependent spouse who has engaged in uncondoned marital misconduct, and the wife’s contention that the trial court could not consider her marital misconduct in determining her award of alimony because the husband condoned the misconduct and sought to salvage his marriage was rejected; there is nothing in the statute to indicate that the trial court cannot consider a spouse’s condoned marital misconduct in calculating its award of alimony to the dependent spouse, as the trial court can consider acts of condoned marital misconduct as part of its determination of an award of alimony.

       Although the husband’s overnight stays with another woman at the hotel were shortly after the parties separated, under the statute, nothing prevented a court from considering incidents of post date-of-separation marital misconduct as corroborating evidence supporting other evidence that marital misconduct occurred during the marriage; therefore, there was competent evidence to support the finding of fact in this regard.

       Trial court was not required to find a change of circumstances in entering an alimony order in a divorce case because at the time of the hearing, the only order in effect was a postseparation support order, and the alimony award thus did not “modify” a prior alimony order, but rather terminated an existing temporary postseparation support; because the wife failed to assign error to any of the trial court’s findings of fact, they were binding on appeal, and absent a showing that the trial court failed to make any finding as to a particular factor, the wife failed to demonstrate that the trial court’s findings of fact were inadequate.

       Trial court’s alimony award to a wife was not an abuse of discretion because the husband’s marital misconduct was shown, but the award had to be reconsidered in light of the required reconsideration of a related equitable distribution award.

       Trial court did not err in awarding plaintiff 18 years of alimony, given in part that defendant engaged in martial misconduct, was always the sole means of support from the family and had a greater earning capacity than plaintiff, deliberately underreported his income and filed false tax returns, and plaintiff was a dependent spouse in need of alimony and was functionally unemployable.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering a wife’s current net monthly income in determining the alimony award because based on the evidence presented and consideration of the statutory factors, the trial court awarded the husband $ 1,750 per month in alimony; the wife’s current net monthly income was $ 10,230, and her total monthly reasonable financial needs and expenses were $ 8,240.

        Where the wife received pro bono counsel during the alimony proceedings, she was not entitled to an award of counsel fees under G.S. 50-16.4, as counsel fees referred only to fees paid by the wife to counsel for services rendered, and no such payment was made; the purpose of the statute was to even the playing field for a dependent spouse seeking alimony, and since pro bono services were rendered there were no costs to shift.

        Appellate court did not err in affirming the trial court’s ruling that denied the wife’s request for an award of attorney fees in a divorce case where the wife was represented on a pro bono basis by her counsel through the Volunteer Lawyers Program; an award of attorney fees, under the plain language of the relevant statute, would have to benefit and such an award under the circumstances could not do so because she was not obligated to pay counsel fees.

        In an action for alimony and counsel fees pendente lite and for alimony without divorce, plaintiff, on the day set for hearing of the motion for alimony and counsel fees pendente lite, filed “certificate and affidavit” stating that there had been a reconciliation between plaintiff and defendant and that plaintiff “withdraws and renounces the complaint” and “takes a voluntary nonsuit . . . and prays the court to dismiss” the action as of nonsuit. Plaintiff’s attorneys filed petition for counsel fees against defendant, and defendant’s attorney filed plaintiff’s “certificate and affidavit” as an affidavit in support of defendant’s resistance to judgment allowing counsel fees against him. After the petition was filed and after the court had announced its intention of allowing same, judgment as of nonsuit was tendered and signed by the court. It was held that at the time the petition for counsel fees was filed, the complaint was still a part of the record and the action was still pending, and the petition amounted to a motion to have the court act upon the prayer as made by plaintiff in her complaint, and the action of the court in allowing counsel fees to plaintiff’s attorneys against defendant was affirmed.

        When allowable, the amount of attorneys’ fees in an action for alimony without divorce is within the sound discretion of the court below and is unappealable except for abuse of that discretion. The statute itself, however, contains some guides to the exercise of that discretion, and practice has developed others. Within the rule of reasonableness the court must consider, along with other things, the condition and circumstances of the defendant. Stadiem v.

       <p>
        In making its determination of the proper amount of counsel fees which are to be awarded a dependent spouse as litigant or appellant, the trial court is under an obligation to conduct a broad inquiry, considering as relevant factors the nature and worth of the services rendered, the magnitude of the task imposed upon counsel, and reasonable consideration for the parties’ respective conditions and financial circumstances.

        Once attorneys’ fees are authorized, a trial court must consider several factors in determining the amount of the award, including but not limited to each party’s estate and ability to defray legal costs, the nature and scope of the legal services rendered the dependent spouse, and the skill, time, and labor expended during such representation.

         Absence of Sufficient Findings Is Reversible Error. —

       <p>
        The trial court errs in ordering defendant to pay fees to plaintiff’s attorneys where the court does not make sufficient findings as to plaintiff being a dependent spouse and defendant being the supporting spouse. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 189 S.E.2d 525, <cite class="nc_code">1972 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1855 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The lack of any evidence as to reasonable attorneys’ fees and the absence of any findings by the trial judge based upon such evidence as to the reasonable worth of attorneys’ fees are grounds for reversal of a judgment awarding attorneys’ fees. Austin v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 183 S.E.2d 428, <cite class="nc_code">1971 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1368 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of attorneys’ fees cannot be upheld where the court failed to make findings of fact upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the fees could be based, such as the nature and scope of the legal services rendered and the skill and time required. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 267 S.E.2d 345, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3090 (1980).

       </p>
       <p>
        The court erred in awarding plaintiff counsel fees pendente lite where no findings were made that plaintiff was entitled to the relief demanded, was a dependent spouse and had insufficient means whereon to subsist during prosecution of the suit and to defray the necessary expenses thereof. Guy v. Guy, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 343, 219 S.E.2d 291, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1847 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court erred in awarding counsel fees to the wife in a child support action where the court made no findings as to the wife’s ability to pay or the reasonableness of the fees. Horner v. Horner, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 267 S.E.2d 65, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3076 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factual findings on award of attorneys’ fees were deficient as to child support where there was no finding that the supporting spouse refused to provide adequate support under circumstances existing at the time the action was initiated, and as to both alimony and child support, where there were no factual findings upon which a determination of the reasonableness of the award could be based, other than the trial court’s statement that the time expended was “reasonably necessary.” Patton v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 337 S.E.2d 607, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court made no findings with regard to the wife’s ability to subsist during prosecution of the suit or her ability to defray the necessary expenses of suit, its award of attorney fees in favor of the wife was improper. Swain v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 795, 635 S.E.2d 504, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2139 (2006).

        Trial court’s findings that (1) a wife’s income had increased from the date of separation until the date of the action, (2) the wife continued to live at the marital residence while the husband voluntarily paid at least half of the monthly mortgage payments, (3) the husband paid the wife monthly post-separation support, and (4) the husband had previously paid $2,000 towards the wife’s attorney’s fees supported its conclusion of law that the wife was able to subsist and defray the necessary expenses related to prosecuting the action and the denial of the wife’s motion for attorney’s fees.

       <p>
        In determining whether one qualifies as a dependent spouse under G.S. 50-16.1(3) as well as in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the courts must consider the factors enumerated in this section for determining the amount of alimony. These factors include the estates, earnings, earning capacity, condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, and other facts of the particular case. Beaman v. Beaman, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 336 S.E.2d 129, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4398 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “accustomed standard of living of the parties”
   
   in subsection (a) of this section completes the contemplated legislative meaning of “maintenance and support” in G.S. 50-16.1(3). The latter phrase clearly means more than a level of mere economic survival. Plainly it contemplates the economic standard established by the marital partnership for the family unit during the years in which the marital contract was intact. It anticipates that alimony, to the extent it can possibly do so, shall sustain that standard of living for the dependent spouse to which the parties together became accustomed. Williams v.

       <p>
        In the case of both alimony and alimony pendente lite, the order concerning the amount must be supported by a conclusion of law that such amount is necessary under the circumstances. This conclusion of law, in turn, must be supported by specific findings of fact as to the estates, earnings, earning capacity, condition, and accustomed standard of living of the parties, as well as other relevant factors.

       <p>
        In determining the amount of alimony to be awarded, the trial judge must comply with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 52, i.e., he must find facts specially, state separately the conclusions of law resulting from the facts so found, and direct entry of appropriate judgment; all the evidentiary facts need not be recited, but G.S. 1A-1, Rule 52 requires specific findings of ultimate facts established by the evidence which determine the issues involved and are essential to support the conclusions of law.

       </p>
       <p>
        To make a valid order for alimony, the trial court must make detailed findings concerning the following: (1) The estates of the parties; (2) the earnings of the parties; (3) the earning capacity of the parties; (4) the condition of the parties; and (5) the accustomed standard of living of the parties.

       </p>
       <p>
        Former husband’s motion to modify alimony was properly denied because the trial court’s finding that his income had not substantially decreased was supported by evidence that his income went through normal variations and fluctuations and that his average annual income was more than his average income during the time period prior to the alimony order.

        Unless the supporting spouse is deliberately depressing his or her income or indulging in excessive spending because of a disregard of the marital obligation to provide support for the dependent spouse, the ability of the supporting spouse to pay is ordinarily determined by his or her income at the time the award is made. If the supporting spouse is deliberately depressing income or engaged in excessive spending, then capacity to earn, instead of actual income, may be the basis of the award. Quick v.

      “(a) Alimony or alimony pendente lite shall not be payable when adultery is pleaded in bar of demand for alimony or alimony pendente lite, made in an action or cross action, and the issue of adultery is found against the spouse seeking alimony, but this shall not be a bar to reasonable counsel fees.

        A wife who, in a valid deed of separation, has released her husband from his support obligation is remitted to her rights under the agreement, and as long as the deed of separation stands unimpeached, the court is without power to award her alimony and counsel fees. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 48</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 227, 1964 N.C. LEXIS 441 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife sought a divorce a mensa and alimony, notwithstanding the provisions of a valid separation agreement which the husband had “fully performed,” could not, after her husband had performed his part of the contract, obtain an award of alimony.

       <p>
        When a court awards alimony pendente lite, it has authority to cause the husband (supporting spouse) to secure so much of his estate as may be necessary to comply with its order. Such order as may be necessary for the protection of the wife (dependent spouse) is the limit of the court’s authority. It cannot penalize defendant unless and until he refuses to comply with the court’s direction. Harris v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 416</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 83, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 365 (1962).

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court had no power to order defendant husband to make a lump sum payment of $50,000.00 to plaintiff wife where it was apparent that the effect of the court’s order would be to force defendant to liquidate, either by sale or mortgage, his only remaining assets having any substantial value, not for the purpose of paying for the maintenance and support of defendant, but in order to effect a division of his estate with her.

        The law imposes a continuing legal duty upon a husband (supporting spouse) to support his wife (dependent spouse). Such duty is enforceable in a variety of ways: through criminal sanctions imposed for willful abandonment coupled with nonsupport, and through civil decrees granting alimony, alimony pendente lite, or alimony without divorce on the basis of misconduct or failure to support.

        While it is true that the determination of dependency properly rests with the trial judge, and not with the jury, where the grounds asserted for alimony are asserted simultaneously as grounds for divorce, the right to alimony depends on the legal entitlement to divorce, regardless of financial dependency. The ordinary and correct procedure in such cases, therefore, is to allow the jury to render its verdict on the “fault” issues of divorce, and then and only then to move to a bench hearing on dependency and the proper amount, if any, of alimony.

        A “supporting spouse” is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent or from whom such other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. A spouse meets the definition if he or she qualifies under either test, which essentially is the same as that applied for “dependent spouse.” The primary issue is not the supporting spouse’s ability to pay, but whether the spouse seeking alimony is a dependent spouse.

        The complaint in an action for alimony without divorce must allege facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action under the provision of the statute for the court to allow wife (dependent spouse) from the estate or earnings of her husband (supporting spouse) a reasonable support and counsel fees, and when the wife alleges only that she has left her husband because he failed to fulfill his promise to supply certain conveniences, this is insufficient. McManus v. McManus, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 740</cite>, 133 S.E. 9, 1926 N.C. LEXIS 166 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff, in an action for alimony without divorce on the ground of abandonment, is not required to allege the acts and conduct relied upon as the basis of the action with that degree of particularity as is required when the cause of action is based on such indignities to the person of plaintiff as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome. Sguros v. Sguros, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 408</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 79, 1960 N.C. LEXIS 591 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for alimony without divorce, allegations that the husband had been abusive and violent toward plaintiff and that she had been made to fear for her safety were insufficient, it being necessary that plaintiff allege specific acts of misconduct on the part of the husband so that the court could determine whether his conduct was in fact such as constituted cause for divorce from bed and board, and that plaintiff also specify what, if anything, she did or said at the time, in order that the court could determine whether she provoked the difficulty.

       </p>
       <p>
        The essential elements required to be alleged
   
   in an action for alimony without divorce are (1) separation of the husband (supporting spouse) from the wife (dependent spouse), and (2) his failure to provide her with necessary subsistence according to his means and condition in life. Trull v. Trull, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 196</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 225, 1948 N.C. LEXIS 446 (1948); Bowling v. Bowling, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 527</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 228, 1960 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for alimony without divorce, it suffices for wife (dependent spouse) to allege and prove (1) the existence of a valid marriage between the parties, and (2) that the husband (supporting spouse) has separated himself from the wife and failed to provide her (and the children of the marriage) with necessary subsistence according to his means, or, instead of the latter, that the husband is a drunkard or spendthrift.

       </p>
       <p>
        A wife’s complaint states a cause of action for alimony without divorce under the statute if it alleges separation without providing subsistence, or alleges that the husband (supporting spouse) is a drunkard or spendthrift or is guilty of any misconduct or acts that would be or constitute cause for divorce either absolute or from bed and board.

       </p>
       <p>
        To state a cause of action for alimony without divorce it is necessary to allege: (1) the marriage, (2) the separation of the husband (supporting spouse) from the wife (dependent spouse) and his failure to provide the wife and children of the marriage reasonable subsistence, i.e., abandonment, or some conduct on the part of the husband constituting cause for divorce, either absolute or from bed and board, and (3) want of provocation on the part of the wife.

        In an action for alimony without divorce, as in an action for divorce a mensa et thoro by the wife (dependent spouse), she must not only set out with some particularity the acts of cruelty upon the part of the husband (supporting spouse), but she must also aver, and consequently offer proof, that such acts were without adequate provocation on her part. The omission of such allegations is fatal. Howell v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 62</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 169, 1943 N.C. LEXIS 204 (1943); Best v.

        The present statutory requirement for findings of fact by the trial judge in pendente lite awards of alimony is a departure from the practice as it existed prior to October 1, 1967. Hatcher v. Hatcher, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 562, 173 S.E.2d 33, <cite class="nc_code">1970 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1737 (1970); Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C.

       <p>
        The requirement of subsection (f) of this section that facts be found to support an award of alimony is a new one imposed by Session Laws 1967, c. 1153, s. 2. Austin v.

       <p>
        The distinction between the “finding of facts” and the “stating of conclusions” by the trial judge
   
   after he has heard the evidence in an alimony pendente lite matter is somewhat analogous to the distinction between a witness testifying as to a “fact” and stating his “opinion.” Peoples v.

         Some of the cases cited below were decided under former G.S. 50-14, which dealt with alimony in actions for divorce a mensa et thoro, former G.S. 50-15, which dealt with alimony pendente lite in divorce actions, and former G.S. 50-16, which dealt with actions for alimony without divorce.

       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes codified as G.S. 50-16.1 through 50-16.10 all deal with the same subject matter, alimony, and are to be construed in pari materia. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1257 (1982).

       <p>
        G.S. 50-16.9 does not list factors to help in the modification decision, but the alimony statutes, G.S. 50-16.1 through 50-16.10, have been read in pari materia because they deal with the same subject matter. Broughton v. Broughton, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 778, 294 S.E.2d 772, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2838 (1982).

         Jurisdiction Under Long-Arm Statute. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides only that an alimony order entered by a court of another jurisdiction may be modified by a court of this State “upon gaining jurisdiction over the person of both parties”; therefore, statutory jurisdiction arises, if at all, under G.S. 1-75.4, the North Carolina “long-arm” statute. Schofield v. Schofield, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 338 S.E.2d 132, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1964 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Money payments are “things of value” within the meaning of G.S. 1-75.4(5)d, the long-arm statute; thus, in an action brought by resident husband against nonresident wife to have alimony obligation reduced or terminated, statutory jurisdiction existed. However, under the circumstances, defendant did not have sufficient minimum contacts with North Carolina and her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was improperly denied. Schofield v. Schofield, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 338 S.E.2d 132, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1964 (1986).

         Alimony Award Held Fair to Both Wife and Husband. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a husband’s estate was substantially larger than a wife’s estate, it would have been unfair to require the wife to further deplete her estate while allowing the husband to maintain his; because a modified alimony award required both parties to deplete their estates to meet their living expenses, award was fair to both parties. Swain v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 795, 635 S.E.2d 504, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2139 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order for payment of alimony is not a final judgment,
   
   since it may be modified upon application of either party; thus, an action for alimony would continue to be “pending” in the court of proper jurisdiction, which is now the district court. Peoples v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 174 S.E.2d 2, <cite class="nc_code">1970 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1508 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A final judgment could not be entered under former G.S. 50-16, as the necessity of such provisions for the wife and children would cease if the parties resumed the marriage relation, and could not properly be continued if the husband procured a divorce for the fault of the wife. Skittletharpe v. Skittletharpe, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 72</cite>, 40 S.E. 851, 1902 N.C. LEXIS 20 (1902); Hooper v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 1</cite>, 80 S.E. 64, 1913 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        An order entered under former G.S. 50-16 was not a final determination and did not affect the final rights of the parties. Deal v. Deal, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 489</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 24, 1963 N.C. LEXIS 588 (1963).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where, within the exercise of his sound discretion, the judge having jurisdiction has allowed the wife a reasonable subsistence, attorneys’ fees, etc., in her proceedings for alimony without divorce, the order of allowance may be thereafter modified or vacated as the statute provides upon application to the proper jurisdiction for the circumstances to be inquired into and the merits of the case determined.

       </p>
       <p>
        An order for the payment of alimony is res judicata between the parties, but is not a final judgment, since the court has the power, upon application of either party, to modify the order for changed conditions of the parties.

Rayfield v. Rayfield, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 691</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 399, 1955 N.C. LEXIS 666 (1955).

        Orders which modify alimony or support payments effective as of the date of the petition, or subsequent thereto, but prior to the date of the order of modification, are not subject to the criticism that they have retroactive effect which destroys vested rights. This is true because the modification and the whole proceeding in which it is made are referable to the date of the filing of the petition and any change effective as of that date cannot be said to be retroactive.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in modifying the husband’s alimony obligation back to the date of his motion to modify alimony based upon depletion of his estate because it correctly considered the comparison of the estates of the parties, nor did it abuse its discretion by basing the alimony award on a combination of the husband’s estate and his current income recognizing that his estate would be depleted to maintain the alimony obligation during his time of unemployment, even in the absence of bad faith or imputation of income for purposes of alimony.

        On a motion to modify or terminate an order of alimony, it is appropriate for the trial court to consider whether the dependent spouse’s financial need, that is, dependency, as it relates to the factors in G.S. 50-16.5, has changed.

       <p>
        Trial court could determine that the wife’s circumstances had changed substantially when the wife and husband’s minor child turned 18-years-old, and grant the wife’s motion for an increase in alimony, because the original alimony award attributed some expenses to the minor child, and the wife was forced to take on those expenses when the minor child turned 18-years-old. At the same time, the trial court could determine that the husband was not entitled to decrease the husband’s alimony payment, as the husband was still able to make the original alimony payments ordered despite a decrease in income.

       <p>
        Findings of fact found by the trial court held supported by the evidence and clearly and more than amply supported the court’s conclusion that defendant had failed to show a substantial change of circumstances that would warrant a modification of consent judgment providing for alimony and child support. Outlaw v. Outlaw, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 366 S.E.2d 247, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 255 (1988).

       <p>
        Former husband’s motion to modify alimony was properly denied because the evidence supported the finding that he had continued meeting his financial obligations and had made substantial discretionary purchases and investments, as he made his alimony payments in full and in a timely manner, and an increase in his expenses was based on voluntary choices and expenditures.

        In determining whether a change in circumstances had occurred for purposes of a motion to terminate alimony, a trial court was not allowed to reconsider a spouse’s dependent spouse status, as that was adjudicated at initial alimony hearing; alimony could have been reduced to zero, but that did not result in loss of dependent spouse status.

For example, the parties may keep the property settlement provision aspects of their separation agreement out of court and in contract, while presenting their provision for alimony to the court for approval. The result of such action would be that the alimony provision is enforceable and modifiable as a court order while the property settlement provisions would be enforceable and modifiable under traditional contract methods.

       <p>
        Where a court adopts the agreement of the parties as its own determination of the rights of the parties and orders the husband to pay alimony, the consent judgment is a decree of the court and is modifiable and enforceable by contempt. Jones v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 256 S.E.2d 474, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2768 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court-adopted consent judgment in a domestic setting has been variously characterized as a species of contract which has been superseded by the court’s adoption of the agreement between the parties as its own determination of their respective rights and obligations. Once the court adopts the agreement of the parties and sets it forth as a judgment of the court with appropriate ordering language and the signature of the court, the contractual character of the agreement is subsumed into the court-ordered judgment. At that point the court and the parties are no longer dealing with a mere contract between the parties. That is not to say that such a contract may not eventually result in a judgment of the court which would be enforceable by contempt. Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 401</cite>, 298 S.E.2d 345, 1983 N.C. LEXIS 1079 (1983).

       <p>
        For a court to have power to modify a consent judgment, the first requirement of this section, as with case law, is that the judgment consented to be an order of a court. The second essential requirement is that the order be one to pay alimony. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1117 (1979).

However, if the support provision and the division of property constitute a reciprocal consideration so that the entire agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties.

        In North Carolina (1) an agreement for division of property rights, and (2) an order for the payment of alimony, within the accepted definition of that term, may be included as separable provisions in a consent judgment. In such a case, the alimony provision is subject to modification where it has been ordered by the district court. However, if the support provision and the division of property constitute a reciprocal consideration so that the entire agreement would be destroyed by a modification of the support provision, they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties.

         How Separability Determined. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While an agreement for the division of property rights and an order for the payment of alimony may be included as separate provisions in a consent judgment, the fact that both provisions are included in the judgment is, standing alone, inconclusive of the issue of separability. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1117 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Recitals in a consent judgment and the judgment of divorce to the effect that all matters in controversy arising from the pleadings had been agreed upon were not determinable upon the question as to whether the support provision of the consent decree was separable, and therefore modifiable, or instead constituted consideration for a property settlement. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 246 S.E.2d 591, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2791 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1117 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a provision in a consent judgment is for alimony alone and thus severable from the remaining provisions and terminable upon the wife’s remarriage, or whether the provision for alimony and the provisions for division of property constitute reciprocal consideration so that they are not separable and may not be changed without the consent of both parties, a consent judgment must be construed in the same manner as a contract to ascertain the intent of the parties. Allison v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 277 S.E.2d 551, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a consent judgment is ambiguous, the intentions of the parties must be determined from evidence of the facts and circumstances surrounding its entry, just as the intentions of the parties to an ambiguous written contract must be determined from the surrounding circumstances. Barr v. Barr, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 284 S.E.2d 762, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3011 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the intention of the parties regarding the reciprocity of agreements in a consent order is not evident from a reading thereof, evidence of the negotiations and contemporaneous property settlement agreements of the parties is admissible to clarify the uncertainty created when the nonmodification provision of the order appears to be void as a matter of law under this section.

         Burden of Proof on Separability. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases in which the question of whether provisions in a consent judgment or separation agreement are separable is not adequately addressed in the document itself, there is a presumption that provisions in a separation agreement or consent judgment made a part of the court’s order are separable and that provisions for support payments therein are subject to modification upon an appropriate showing of changed circumstances. The effect of this presumption is to place the burden of proof on the issue of separability on the party opposing modification. The policies underlying the presumption require that this burden be discharged only by a preponderance of the evidence. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 661</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 698, 1979 N.C. LEXIS 1117 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining whether a consent judgment may be modified under this section, there is a presumption that the provisions for property division and support payments are separable. The burden of proof rests on the party opposing modification to show that the provisions are not separable. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840, 1982 N.C.

       <p>
        In accord with this section, a consent order containing a proviso purporting to waive the applicability of this section may be modified unless defendant can show that it was an integral part of the property settlement. Rowe v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 177</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 840, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1257 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        By enacting this section, the legislature has clearly expressed that it is the public policy of this State that consent orders to pay alimony are modifiable. In the usual case a proviso in an order purporting to waive applicability of this section would be contrary to this policy and, therefore, without force and effect. Rowe v.

       <p>
        In a consent judgment, the word “alimony”
   
   and the provision that plaintiff’s support payments to defendant would continue “until the defendant remarries or dies,” is evidence, albeit inconclusive, of the parties’ intention to treat the support provisions as alimony.

        Registration is a ministerial duty of the clerk, not exercising any power over the obligor’s person or property. Such registration cannot lawfully transform foreign alimony orders that are modifiable as to past-due installments in the jurisdiction of rendition into North Carolina orders subject to North Carolina law retrospectively.

        Alimony orders registered pursuant to former G.S. 52A-26, et seq., retain, for their lifespan prior to registration, their foreign identity, and the laws of the foreign jurisdiction apply in any subsequent enforcement proceeding. This means that at any enforcement proceeding under former G.S. 52A-30 the obligor may apply, just as at a civil action instituted under subsection (c) of this section, for a new order modifying or superseding the foreign order “to the extent that it could have been so modified in the jurisdiction where granted.” Allsup v.

In addition, upon motion by the supporting spouse, if a final judgment is entered in any action denying alimony because none of the grounds specified in G.S. 50-16.2 exists, the court may enter a judgment against the spouse to whom the payments were made for the amount of alimony pendente lite paid by the supporting spouse to that spouse pending a final disposition of the case.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other pending claims filed in the same action, a party may appeal from an order or judgment adjudicating a claim for absolute divorce, divorce from bed and board, the validity of a premarital agreement as defined by G.S. 52B-2(1), child custody, child support, alimony, or equitable distribution if the order or judgment would otherwise be a final order or judgment within the meaning of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 54(b), but for the other pending claims in the same action. A party does not forfeit the right to appeal under this section if the party fails to immediately appeal from an order or judgment described in this section. An appeal from an order or judgment under this section shall not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over any other claims pending in the same action.

       While G.S. 50-19.1 restricts interlocutory family law appeals to those claims listed in that section, an avenue for appeal nevertheless exists because, based on precedent allowing interlocutory appeals in family law cases based on a “substantial right,” the traditional “substantial right” exception may also apply to other interlocutory orders entered in a family law case but that do not appear listed in the statute.

       Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider a wife’s appeal of the trial court’s order of absolute divorce because the order was interlocutory inasmuch as the equitable distribution claim and motion for establishment of child support were still pending before the trial court, the trial court not certify the matter for appellate review, the wife did not show a deprivation of a substantial right, the order on appeal does not fall within the types of orders set forth by statute, and the wife did not request a suspension of the Rules.

       For purposes of this section:
       <ol>
        <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1b1">
         “Marital property” means all real and personal property acquired by either spouse or both spouses during the course of the marriage and before the date of the separation of the parties, and presently owned, except property determined to be separate property or divisible property in accordance with subdivision (2) or (4) of this subsection. Marital property includes all vested and nonvested pension, retirement, and other deferred compensation rights, and vested and nonvested military pensions eligible under the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act. It is presumed that all property acquired after the date of marriage and before the date of separation is marital property except property which is separate property under subdivision (2) of this subsection. It is presumed that all real property creating a tenancy by the entirety acquired after the date of marriage and before the date of separation is marital property. Either presumption may be rebutted by the greater weight of the evidence.

         “Separate property” means all real and personal property acquired by a spouse before marriage or acquired by a spouse by devise, descent, or gift during the course of the marriage. However, property acquired by gift from the other spouse during the course of the marriage shall be considered separate property only if such an intention is stated in the conveyance. Property acquired in exchange for separate property shall remain separate property regardless of whether the title is in the name of the husband or wife or both and shall not be considered to be marital property unless a contrary intention is expressly stated in the conveyance. The increase in value of separate property and the income derived from separate property shall be considered separate property. All professional licenses and business licenses which would terminate on transfer shall be considered separate property.

        </li>
        <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1b4">

           All property, property rights, or any portion thereof received after the date of separation but before the date of distribution that was acquired as a result of the efforts of either spouse during the marriage and before the date of separation, including, but not limited to, commissions, bonuses, and contractual rights.

       There shall be an equal division by using net value of marital property and net value of divisible property unless the court determines that an equal division is not equitable.

      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1e">
       Subject to the presumption of subsection (c) of this section that an equal division is equitable, it shall be presumed in every action that an in-kind distribution of marital or divisible property is equitable. This presumption may be rebutted by the greater weight of the evidence, or by evidence that the property is a closely held business entity or is otherwise not susceptible of division in-kind. In any action in which the presumption is rebutted, the court in lieu of in-kind distribution shall provide for a distributive award in order to achieve equity between the parties. The court may provide for a distributive award to facilitate, effectuate or supplement a distribution of marital or divisible property. The court may provide that any distributive award payable over a period of time be secured by a lien on specific property.

      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1f">
       The court shall provide for an equitable distribution without regard to alimony for either party or support of the children of both parties.

       If the court orders the transfer of real or personal property or an interest therein, the court may also enter an order which shall transfer title, as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 70 and G.S. 1-228.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1h">
       If either party claims that any real property is marital property or divisible property, that party may cause a notice of lis pendens to be recorded pursuant to Article 11 of Chapter 1 of the General Statutes. Any person whose conveyance or encumbrance is recorded or whose interest is obtained by descent, prior to the filing of the lis pendens, shall take the real property free of any claim resulting from the equitable distribution proceeding. The court may cancel the notice of lis pendens upon substitution of a bond with surety in an amount determined by the court to be sufficient provided the court finds that the claim of the spouse against property subject to the notice of lis pendens can be satisfied by money damages.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1i">
       Upon filing an action or motion in the cause requesting an equitable distribution or alleging that an equitable distribution will be requested when it is timely to do so, a party may seek injunctive relief pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65 and Chapter 1, Article 37, to prevent the disappearance, waste or conversion of property alleged to be marital property, divisible property, or separate property of the party seeking relief. The court, in lieu of granting an injunction, may require a bond or other assurance of sufficient amount to protect the interest of the other spouse in the property. Upon application by the owner of separate property which was removed from the marital home or possession of its owner by the other spouse, the court may enter an order for reasonable counsel fees and costs of court incurred to regain its possession, but such fees shall not exceed the fair market value of the separate property at the time it was removed.

       Unless good cause is shown that there should not be an interim distribution, the court may, at any time after an action for equitable distribution has been filed and prior to the final judgment of equitable distribution, enter orders declaring what is separate property and may also enter orders dividing part of the marital property, divisible property or debt, or marital debt between the parties. The partial distribution may provide for a distributive award and may also provide for a distribution of marital property, marital debt, divisible property, or divisible debt. Any such orders entered shall be taken into consideration at trial and proper credit given.Hearings held pursuant to this subsection may be held at sessions arranged by the chief district court judge pursuant to G.S. 7A-146 and, if held at such sessions, shall not be subject to the reporting requirements of G.S. 7A-198.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1j">
       In any order for the distribution of property made pursuant to this section, the court shall make written findings of fact that support the determination that the marital property and divisible property has been equitably divided.
      </li>
      <li id="t50a01s50-20ol1k">
       The rights of the parties to an equitable distribution of marital property and divisible property are a species of common ownership, the rights of the respective parties vesting at the time of the parties’ separation.

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In enacting the equitable distribution statute, the General Assembly intended to avoid taxable events which would chill the use of equitable distribution. Lawing v. Lawing, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 344 S.E.2d 100, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2279 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature did not intend the Equitable Distribution Act to apply solely to property acquired on or after the effective date of the act or its amendments. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595, 1988 N.C. LEXIS 372 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only married persons are afforded the protections of this statute; therefore, the Court of Appeals would not expand the legislature’s clear definition of marital property to include property acquired prior to marriage. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1031 (1988).

         No Right to Jury Trial in Equitable Distribution Action. —

       <p>
        No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, this section and G.S. 50-21, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487, 1989 N.C. LEXIS 542 (1989).

        This section sets forth reasonably clear guidelines and definitions

         Separate Trials for Divorce and Distribution. —

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court’s order granting the plaintiff’s motion for separate trials of his claim for absolute divorce and the defendant’s claim for equitable distribution of the marital property did not constitute an abuse of discretion, nor did it prejudice the defendant’s substantial rights. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2458 (1987).

        G.S. 52-4 is not inconsistent with or repugnant to this section.
   
   Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 437</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 430, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2428 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 52-4 governs legal interests in property during an ongoing marriage, while this section governs its disposition after divorce. Johnson v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 437</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 430, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2428 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge is required to conduct a three-stage analysis
   
   in order to equitably distribute the marital assets. He must first ascertain, upon appropriate findings of fact, what is marital property; then determine the net market value of the marital property as of the date of separation; and finally, make an equitable distribution between the parties. Willis v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 546, 358 S.E.2d 571, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2741 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying our equitable distribution statutes, the trial court must follow a three-step procedure: (1) classification, (2) evaluation and (3) distribution. Seifert v. Seifert, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 346 S.E.2d 504, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred as a matter of law in rejecting a wife’s claim for equitable distribution where it simply took the parties at their word that each would pay certain debts, without actually classifying, valuing, and distributing the debts as required under G.S. 50-20(a), and it had improperly based its determination that equitable distribution was not warranted on the wife’s failure to negotiate a settlement with the husband’s counsel. Eason v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 784 S.E.2d 200, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 94 (2016).

        This section is designed to divide property equitably, based upon the relative positions of the parties at the time of the divorce, rather than on what they may have intended when the property was acquired.

        This section’s primary focus is to devise a procedure for equitably distributing “marital,” as opposed to “separate,” property upon dissolution of the marriage. Mims v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 41</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 779, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1248 (1982).

        Equitable distribution reflects the idea that marriage is a partnership enterprise
   
   to which both spouses make vital contributions and which entitles the homemaker spouse to a share of the property acquired during the relationship. White v. White, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 770</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 829, 1985 N.C. LEXIS 1497 (1985).

        This section was enacted in recognition of marriage as a partnership, economic and otherwise, to which both parties contribute, either directly or indirectly. By enacting this section, the Legislature granted courts the power to consider factors other than legal title in distributing the marital assets upon the dissolution of the marriage, thereby permitting the courts to make an equitable distribution which effects a return to each party of that which he or she contributed to the marriage.

         “Source of Funds” Rule as to When Property Is Acquired. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Court of Appeals has adopted the source of funds rule, by which property is “acquired” as it is paid for, so that it may include both marital and separate ownership interests. Under the source of funds rule acquisition is an ongoing process. It does not depend upon inception of title, but upon monetary or other contributions made by one or both of the parties. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 327 S.E.2d 910, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3427, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 331</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 488, 1985 N.C. LEXIS 1953 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the source of the funds theory, when both the marital and separate estates contribute assets towards the acquisition of property, each estate is entitled to an interest in the property in the ratio which its contribution bears to the total investment in the property. Thus, both the separate and marital estates receive a proportionate and fair return on their investments. Wade v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 325 S.E.2d 260, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3145 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts have adopted a source of funds approach to distinguish marital and separate contributions to a single asset. Under the source of funds approach, each party retains as separate property the amount he contributed to purchase the property plus passive appreciation in value. McLean v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 363 S.E.2d 95, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the source of funds rule, the financial or other contributions by the marital and separate estates toward the acquisition of property must be identified and accounted for. McIver v. McIver, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 116, 374 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1031 (1988).

        The trial court erred in using a source of funds approach

       <p>
        North Carolina has adopted the “source of funds” rule to determine whether and to what extent an asset is part of the marital estate. Even when property is converted after the date of separation, this rule continues to apply, and the dispositive question in determining if an asset is a marital asset remains whether the source of funds therefor were marital funds.

        Plaintiff, as the party claiming the increases in value to separate property to be marital, had the burden of showing by the preponderance of the evidence that the increases in value were marital property. Plaintiff met her burden by showing that all the increases in value were acquired by either or both spouses, were acquired during the course of the marriage, were acquired before the date of separation, and were presently owned.

        The fact that marital property was used to acquire other property after the date of the parties’ separation did not cause it to lose its marital character.

       <p>
        In order to determine what part of a spouse’s inherited interest in a corporation constituted marital property, the trial court would be required to make findings as to: (1) the value of plaintiff’s minority interest at the time of inheritance; (2) the value of plaintiff’s controlling interest at the date of separation; (3) the difference between the two; and (4) the proportion of that difference that were due to active appreciation, i.e., attributable to funds, talent, or labor that were assets of the marital community. The resulting amount would be marital property subject to equitable distribution. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 327 S.E.2d 910, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C.

        Awards or settlements arising from a personal injury claim

To the extent that the award replaces such economic loss occurring after separation, it is the separate property of the injured spouse. However, if the party claiming that the award is marital, i.e., the noninjured spouse, shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the award was acquired by the injured spouse during the marriage and before separation, then the entire award will be marital property unless the other party proves by a preponderance that the award, or some portion of it, was to compensate for economic loss occurring after the date of separation and is therefore separate property.

        When a husband moved a house he had owned prior to the parties’ marriage onto a lot owned by the parties as tenants by the entirety, and the lot and house were sold, it was error for a trial court to classify all of the proceeds from that sale as marital property because, under G.S. 50-20(b)(2), the separate property remained separate absent a clear expression of the husband’s intent to give the property to the marital estate, and there were no findings indicating such an intent, so the trial court had to determine how much of the proceeds were attributable to the husband’s separate house, and how much were attributable to the lot.

        it is not necessary to determine whether post-separation appreciation of a marital asset caused by the activities of a spouse should be treated as the separate property of that spouse where the spouse was paid a fee from marital assets to perform the very services causing the post-separation appreciation to occur, and here, the wife was bound by the manner in which these distributions to the husband were treated on the company tax returns; the husband performed post-separation activities that resulted in part of the appreciation, and the findings supported the treatment of this appreciation as the husband’s separate property.

       <p>
        In ordering an equitable distribution of marital property, a court should make specific findings regarding the value of a spouse’s professional practice and the existence and value of its goodwill, and should clearly indicate the evidence on which its valuations are based, preferably noting the valuation method or methods on which it relied. The court may appoint an additional expert witness under G.S. 8C-1, Rule 706, if needed. On appeal, if it appears that the trial court reasonably approximated the net value of the practice and its goodwill, if any, based on competent evidence and on a sound valuation method or methods, the valuation will not be disturbed. Poore v. Poore, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 331 S.E.2d 266, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3680 (1985).

        When a professional practice has not been established for a sufficient period to determine goodwill based on comparable past earnings, the capitalization of excess earnings method of valuing goodwill should be used, which is based in part on the amount by which the earnings of the professional spouse exceed that which would have been earned by a person with similar education, experience, and skill as an employee in the same general locale.

       <p>
        In light of the subsequent recognition that vested pension and retirement rights should be considered marital property in the 1983 amendment to subsection (b)(1), fairness required that wife’s contributions as a homemaker to the acquisition of at least husband’s vested interests in the pension and profit sharing plans of his professional association should have been considered by the court under subsection (c)(12) in determining an equitable division of the marital property.

        Because of the substantial disparity between the value of the pension benefits and the other assets of the parties,
   
   it was determined to be equitable to award fifty-five percent (55%) of the portion of the defendant’s pension benefits that were accumulated during the marriage to the plaintiff, as provided for in subsection (b)(3)(c).

        The increased component of a retirement annuity, offered to a spouse only after separation
   
   and for which the spouse was not eligible without additional service after the date of separation, is separate property for purposes of equitable distribution, since the increase vested only after the date of separation, and since the incentive increase in pension benefits was compensation for the loss of future earnings.

        Prescribed valuation method
   
   under this section can be expressed as a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total period of time the marriage existed (up to the date of separation) simultaneously with the employment which earned the vested pension or retirement rights; the denominator is the total amount of time the employee spouse is employed in the job which earned the vested pension or retirement rights. This statutorily prescribed fraction automatically provides the method by which to value the pension or retirement pay, as marital property, as of the date of separation, by requiring the numerator to be the amount of time up to the date of separation that the employment which earns the retirement pay exists simultaneously with the marriage period.

        Where at the time the parties separated defendant had been in the Marine Corps during the marriage for 21 years, and at the time of the equitable distribution hearing defendant had been in the Marine Corps for 30 years and thus had achieved the maximum amount of retirement pay permitted regardless of the number of years served, the trial court properly calculated the amount of military retirement pay attributable to the marriage as 21/30 or seventy percent (70%), and having determined that an equal division was equitable, properly awarded the wife one-half of this seventy percent (70%), or thirty-five percent (35%), of the defendant’s gross military retirement pay, while limiting this award to fifty percent (50%) of the defendant’s disposable retired or retainer pay, consistent with the requirement of this section.

       <p>
        Under the fixed percentage method of evaluating pension and retirement benefits, deferral of payment is possible without unfairly reducing the value of the award. The present value of the pension or retirement benefits is not considered in determining the percentage to which the nonemployee spouse is entitled. Moreover, because the nonemployee spouse receives a percentage of the benefits actually paid to the employee spouse, the nonemployee spouse shares in any growth in the benefits. Yet, the formula gives the nonemployee spouse a percentage only of those benefits attributable to the period of the marriage, and that spouse does not share in benefits based on contributions made after the date of separation.

        Trial court properly distributed a portion of an account as a husband’s separate property and another portion of the account as marital property because its findings of fact supported its conclusion of law that the account was part separate property and part marital property; the husband routinely contributed marital funds to the account that were co-mingled with his separate funds.

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for equitable distribution, first the court must classify property as either marital or separate, as defined in subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. Next it must divide the marital property equally, unless it determines that an equal division is not equitable. McLeod v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the Equitable Distribution Statute, the trial judge must follow a three step procedure, i.e., (i) classification, (ii) evaluation and (iii) distribution. Cable v. Cable, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 134, 331 S.E.2d 765, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3723 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (c) of this section, equitable distribution applies only to the net value of marital property. This requires the trial court to first ascertain what is marital property, then to find the net value of that property, and finally to make a distribution based upon the equitable goals of the statute and the various factors specified therein. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 307 S.E.2d 407, <cite class="nc_code">1983 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3282 (1983); Lawrence v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C.

        To equitably distribute property, it is necessary to identify the property owned, evaluate it and order its distribution. Capps v. Capps, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3593 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In equitably distributing parties’ real property, on remand, the trial court properly treated the lot and house as a single asset and made no findings regarding the values or amounts of appreciation in the value of the lot or house separately, as such a method was supported by existing precedent.

        Wife sufficiently preserved her claim to an equitable distribution of marital property under G.S. 50-11(e) when her answer to her husband’s complaint for divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and G.S. 50-21(a) gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife’s counterclaim for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties’ marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties’ marital and divisible property.

        Rental income received from marital property between the date of separation and the date of the equitable distribution action may not be added to the marital estate. Rather than distributing the sums representing the income received from marital property, the trial court must consider the existence of this income, determine to whose benefit the income has accrued, and then consider that benefit when determining whether an equal or unequal distribution of the marital estate would be equitable.

       <p>
        In determining an appropriate distribution of the marital property, the trial court erred by failing to consider the following factors: (1) evidence that the husband paid homeowner’s insurance premiums on the marital home between the date of separation and the date of the trial should have been considered as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a); (2) evidence that the husband was primarily responsible for maintaining and preserving the marital property between the date of separation and the date of trial also should have been considered as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(11a); and (3) evidence that the wife earned a larger income than the husband should have been considered by the trial court as a distributional factor under subdivision (c)(1).

       <p>
        It was error for a trial court to order an equitable distribution of divorcing parties’ marital property under G.S. 50-20(b)(2) or (4) because the court did not make written findings supporting its determination, it did not indicate whether an equal division was an equitable division, and it could not be determined whether the court had properly valued, classified, and distributed the property.

       <p>
        Although the weight given to any factor is in the trial court’s discretion, the trial court did not make findings on all of the distributional factors upon which evidence was presented; for example, the trial court earlier found that defendant suffered from severe anxiety, clinical depression, multiple seizures and short-term memory loss, but the trial court did not make any findings of fact regarding the factor of the physical and mental health of both parties, and on remand, the trial court was to make findings of fact upon all of the factors upon which evidence was presented.

   the trial court would have to provide more detailed findings to support its decision against in-kind distribution; the order already adequately identified sources of payment for such an award where it referenced both the proceeds of a refinancing of the former marital home and income received from the family business.

        Since the trial court conducted the proper analysis under this section and its conclusions were supported by findings that were, in turn, supported by competent evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by distributing the diminution in value of a home to the wife despite the fact that the husband received the asset.

        North Carolina law did not permit a trial court to consider a party’s future inheritance under the will of a person not yet deceased as a distributional factor for purposes of equitable distribution.
   
   As such, the trial court abused its discretion by basing a portion of its award on evidence that the husband would possibly inherit the property as set out in his father’s will; therefore, because the appellate court was unable to ascertain the extent to which the trial court based its award on the husband’s future inheritance, the appellate court reversed and remanded the order for entry of a new order in accordance with the opinion.

        Contrary to the husband’s argument, the trial court’s order distributing several business holdings to the wife in a divorce case and in ordering the wife to pay a distributive award of $220,542 was proper despite the husband’s claim that the wife did not possess any business experience or acumen; the record revealed that the business interests distributed to the wife did not require the active operation or management by the wife.

       <p>
        In an ex-wife’s adversary proceeding against her debtor ex-husband, the wife was unable to have debts owed to her by the husband pursuant to the parties’ divorce settlement agreement ruled non-dischargeable, because under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(15), the phrase “incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation” required the incurrence of a new debt in the course of the divorce, which was created generally by a hold harmless or indemnification provision in the domestic order or agreement, and their agreement contained no such clause; further, under G.S. 50-20(c)(1), a right of indemnification was not automatic, so without such a provision the wife’s claim failed.

        Trial court did not err by allowing equitable distribution of property acquired during the parties’ marriage as the parties’ prenuptial agreement did not waive their claims to equitable distribution, G.S. 50-20(d); based on the former husband’s stated intentions regarding the creation of the agreement, his discussions with an attorney, and the actual language of the agreement, the trial court could properly find that the agreement constituted a “free trader” agreement that did not waive the parties’ rights to equitable distribution.

         Reconsideration of Alimony or Child Support After Equitable Distribution. —

       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 50-20(f) obviously contemplates that a child support order may precede an equitable distribution order.
   No child support order is ever final and delaying the child support order in lengthy case until after the equitable distribution issue was decided would have prolonged an already long-pending case.
   The trial court’s decision to enter child support order prior to a determination of the equitable distribution issue was proper under the statute. Cohen v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 396 S.E.2d 344, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 984 (1990).

       <p>
        If alimony and child support have not been previously awarded, equitable distribution must be made first; but if alimony or child support has already been awarded, the awards must be reconsidered upon request after the marital property has been equitably distributed. This order of events is required, no doubt, because of the obvious relationship that exists between the property that one has and his or her need for support and the ability to furnish it. Capps v. Capps, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3593 (1984).

        Even assuming arguendo that the parties’ settlement agreement in a divorce was an equitable distribution, a prior child support award, following an equitable distribution, need only be reconsidered upon the request of a party pursuant to G.S. 50-20(f); the father made no such request, and,consequently, the trial court was not required to recalculate his child support obligation in light of any equitable distribution.

        Trial court’s general statement that it “considered the other statutory distributional factors” made no specific reference to the factors under G.S. 50-20(c), regarding distribution of property, making it impossible for an appellate court to determine if it found and relied on any other statutory factors, and its findings on the statutory factors it expressly considered lacked sufficient detail, as the court did not value the marital debts it mentioned, nor did it find whether the husband’s cars were liquid or nonliquid assets, despite the requirement of G.S. 50-20(c)(9) that the court consider the liquid or nonliquid character of all marital property and divisible property.

        Although a trial court’s equitable distribution order, G.S. 50-20 and G.S. 50-21, failed to state the percentage to be distributed to each spouse upon the sale of the parties’ real property, the husband failed to explain how he was prejudiced by the omission of the percentage amount because the figure could be readily calculated using information contained in the findings and conclusions from the trial court’s order, which provided for an equal division of the proceeds; the trial court’s fair market value of the properties was negative $10,000 and $13,884.

        Trial court’s equitable distribution award was proper under circumstances in which the trial court classified the husband’s post-separation payment, from his separate funds, of a mortgage on marital property as divisible property, and found that, based on the wife’s unrepaid loan of $178,710 to the marital business from her separate funds, she was entitled to an award of $178,700 more than that of the husband; the trial court correctly granted the husband credit for his payment by subtracting $75,644 from the marital estate and subtracting $75,644 from his award to give him sole credit for satisfying the marital debt. The trial court made sufficient findings to consider the wife’s loan as a distributional factor and reflecting its distribution decision. McNeely v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C.

       <p>
        Legislature’s intent in subsection (k) was to create a right to equitable distribution
   
   of the marital property, which had not existed up to that time, and to make that right vest at the time of filing for divorce (now at the time of separation). Subsection (k) did not create any vested rights in particular marital property; it created a right to the equitable distribution of that property, whatever a court should determine that property is.

       <p>
        Subsection (k) did not create substantive rights in any party to particular marital property

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to equitable distribution is an inchoate right
   
   exercisable only in a divorce action; thus, absent a consent judgment, the right to equitable property distribution could not be effectuated during the one-year separation period that necessarily precedes a filing for absolute divorce; however, this does not mean that a claim for equitable distribution cannot be made during that period.

       <p>
        The vested right of equitable distribution does not create a property right in marital property, nor does the fact of separation create a lien on specific marital property in favor of the spouse. Rather, it only creates a right to an equitable distribution of that property, whatever a court should determine that property is. Perlow v. Perlow, 128 B.R. 412, 1991 U.S. Dist.

        Trial court did not have authority to reaffirm divorce decree and reserve for future resolution the issue of equitable distribution;
   
   since the trial court did not set aside the divorce, but rather, attempted to nullify the consequences of defendant’s failure to assert her claim for equitable distribution prior to the entry of judgment of divorce, the order failed.
   Even if the court had effectively set aside, briefly, the divorce decree itself and then immediately reinstated the divorce decree with a reservation of an equitable distribution claim, the reservation of the equitable distribution claim would have been a legal nullity because plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his equitable distribution claim and defendant did not, during the time the divorce was arguably set aside, file an answer, counterclaim, or separate action requesting equitable distribution.

       Where the wife, pursuant to entering an employment agreement prior to the parties’ separation, received 10,000 shares of the employer’s stock after the parties’ separation, which were later exchanged with the stock of the corporation that purchased the employer and was sold for net proceeds of $82,637, the trial court did not err in valuing the property pursuant to G.S. 50-21(b), which occurred after 20 years of marriage; it was reasonable for the trial court to infer that the wife’s employment with the employer resulted from experience that the wife gained while working, for 20 years, for the company from which the employer spun off and that, pursuant to G.S. 50-20.1(d), all of the shares were subject to distribution in the divorce.

       Trial court did not err in making an immediate distribution of a former husband’s pension benefits because the husband was fully vested and eligible for early retirement; the trial court awarded the husband all of his pension benefits and then awarded the former wife a larger portion of the remaining assets, precisely as permitted by

       Trial court did not clearly comply with the third and fourth steps of Bishop in reducing a former husband’s pension benefits to present value because its finding of fact as to the actuarial present value of the defined benefit plan did not specifically state whether the present value was being determined as of the earliest retirement date or date of separation; because the cost of living adjustment was not a contribution to the plan or compensation being paid after the date of separation but was instead a gain on the benefit vested at the time of separation, the trial court was required to take it into account under
   G.S. 50-20.1(d).

      <p>
       Although a husband argued the fraction an arbitrator used to determine the marital portion of the husband’s retirement plan account was not in accordance with the directive of G.S. 50-20.1(d), the arbitrator’s determination was not an evident mistake under the Family Law Arbitration Act, G.S. 50-55(a)(1), because even though the husband worked for the employer from 1977 through 2000, the husband only participated in the plan from 1989 through 2000; the husband determined the award was to be premised upon the time the marriage existed, simultaneous with the employment that earned the benefit, for a total of 34 months, as compared to the time the husband participated in the retirement plan, 123 months.

       Trial court erred in classifying and valuing a husband’s IRA because the husband’s pension rollover IRA was funded entirely from the husband’s defined pension, requiring application of the coverture fraction to derive the marital and separate components of the account, rather than the methodology presented by the wife’s expert upon which the trial court relied.

       At any time after a husband and wife begin to live separate and apart from each other, a claim for equitable distribution may be filed and adjudicated, either as a separate civil action, or together with any other action brought pursuant to Chapter 50 of the General Statutes, or as a motion in the cause as provided by G.S. 50-11(e) or (f). Within 90 days after service of a claim for equitable distribution, the party who first asserts the claim shall prepare and serve upon the opposing party an equitable distribution inventory affidavit listing all property claimed by the party to be marital property and all property claimed by the party to be separate property, and the estimated date-of-separation fair market value of each item of marital and separate property. Within 30 days after service of the inventory affidavit, the party upon whom service is made shall prepare and serve an inventory affidavit upon the other party. The inventory affidavits prepared and served pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to amendment and shall not be binding at trial as to completeness or value. The court may extend the time limits in this subsection for good cause shown. The affidavits are subject to the requirements of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 11, and are deemed to be in the nature of answers to interrogatories propounded to the parties. Any party failing to supply the information required by this subsection in the affidavit is subject to G.S. 1A-1, Rules 26, 33, and 37. During the pendency of the action for equitable distribution, discovery may proceed, and the court shall enter temporary orders as appropriate and necessary for the purpose of preventing the disappearance, waste, or destruction of marital or separate property or to secure the possession thereof.Real or personal property located outside of North Carolina is subject to equitable distribution in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 50-20, and the court may include in its order appropriate provisions to ensure compliance with the order of equitable distribution.

      <li id="t50a01s50-21ol1b">
       For purposes of equitable distribution, marital property shall be valued as of the date of the separation of the parties, and evidence of preseparation and postseparation occurrences or values is competent as corroborative evidence of the value of marital property as of the date of the separation of the parties. Divisible property and divisible debt shall be valued as of the date of distribution.

       Within 120 days after the filing of the initial pleading or motion in the cause for equitable distribution, the party first serving the pleading or application shall apply to the court to conduct a scheduling and discovery conference. If that party fails to make application, then the other party may do so. At the conference the court shall determine a schedule of discovery as well as consider and rule upon any motions for appointment of expert witnesses, or other applications, including applications to determine the date of separation, and shall set a date for the disclosure of expert witnesses and a date on or before which an initial pretrial conference shall be held.At the initial pretrial conference the court shall make inquiry as to the status of the case and shall enter a date for the completion of discovery, the completion of a mediated settlement conference, if applicable, and the filing and service of motions, and shall determine a date on or after which a final pretrial conference shall be held and a date on or after which the case shall proceed to trial.The final pretrial conference shall be conducted pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure and the General Rules of Practice in the applicable district or superior court, adopted pursuant to G.S. 7A-34. The court shall rule upon any matters reasonably necessary to effect a fair and prompt disposition of the case in the interests of justice.
      </li>

         The party has willfully obstructed or unreasonably delayed, or has attempted to obstruct or unreasonably delay, discovery proceedings, including failure to make discovery pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 37, or has willfully obstructed or unreasonably delayed or attempted to obstruct or unreasonably delay any pending equitable distribution proceeding, and

        Some of the cases below were decided prior to the rewriting of this section by Session Laws 1987, c. 844, which provides for entry of a consent judgment of equitable distribution prior or subsequent to entry of a divorce judgment, and for institution of an action of equitable distribution prior to entry of a divorce judgment.

       Public policy of this State is that equitable distribution of property shall follow decree of absolute divorce.

      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable distribution, when properly demanded, must be granted upon the divorce decree being entered; and if alimony and child support has not been previously awarded, equitable distribution must be made first; but if alimony or child support has already been awarded, the awards must be reconsidered upon request after the marital property has been equitably distributed. This order of events is required, no doubt, because of the obvious relationship that exists between the property that one has and his or her need for support and the ability to furnish it. Capps v. Capps, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 318 S.E.2d 346 (1984). But see now subsection (a) of this section .
      </p>
      <p>
       It is North Carolina’s public policy that an equitable distribution of property shall follow a decree of absolute divorce. However, a resort to the equitable distribution law is not the only recognized way for married people to dispose of their marital property. An alternative is in G.S. 50-20(d). Case v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 325 S.E.2d 661, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985). And see now subsection (a) of this section .
      </p>
      <p>
       The plain language of subsection (a) of this section clearly provides that the equitable distribution of marital property must follow a decree of absolute divorce; however, the distribution proceedings may be instituted as a cross action or in a suit altogether separate from the divorce action. This section does not require that the distribution hearing must be held immediately following entry of the absolute divorce. Sharp v. Sharp, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 351 S.E.2d 799 (1987). And see now subsection (a) of this section .

       No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, G.S. 50-20 and this section, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case arising from a divorce action, an argument that a trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an equitable distribution on April 5, 2002, was rejected because the prayers for relief put the parties on notice that they both sought equitable distribution. Moreover, regardless of whether the parties were separated at the time the complaint was filed, the record was clear that the parties were separated by the time the claim for equitable distribution was asserted. Gurganus v. Gurganus, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 796 S.E.2d 811, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 89 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       While both parties raised a claim for equitable distribution, both raised it prior to the date of separation. Because no claim for equitable distribution was filed after the parties’ date of separation, the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the equitable distribution order. Standridge v. Standridge, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 834, 817 S.E.2d 463, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 566 (2018).

       A plaintiff in a divorce action may admit to a claim for equitable distribution in a reply, and join in the claims for an equitable distribution of the marital property through a reply pleading. The defendant is precluded, by principles of equitable estoppel, from defeating plaintiff’s right to equitable distribution by submitting to a voluntary dismissal of his counterclaim. Hunt v.

       Wife sufficiently preserved her claim to an equitable distribution of marital property under G.S. 50-11(e) when her answer to her husband’s complaint for divorce requested and reserved a right to equitable distribution, because the remedy of equitable distribution in a divorce case only applied to marital assets, and G.S. 50-21(a) gave a party asserting a claim for such redress 90 days to provide specific information about the property claimed to be subject to equitable distribution; so, to constitute a valid equitable distribution claim, the wife’s counterclaim for equitable distribution did not have to state that it applied to the parties’ marital assets or property, and the husband was put on notice that the wife asked the court to equitably distribute the parties’ marital and divisible property.

       Client’s legal malpractice action failed as even assuming an attorney negligently failed to advise the client or to value the client’s estate properly under G.S. 50-20(e) and G.S. 50-21(b), the client made no forecast of the value of the marital estate as of the date of separation and therefore as to the value of the client’s equitable distribution claim; thus, the client failed to show that any negligence by the attorney proximately caused damage to the client.

       Whether to impose sanctions and which sanctions to impose under this section are decisions vested in the trial court and reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion, and in applying this standard the appellate court will uphold a trial court’s order of sanctions unless it is manifestly unsupported by reason.

       Evidence that the wife willfully obstructed or attempted to obstruct or unreasonably delay discovery proceedings and equitable distribution proceedings, which caused prejudice to the husband, supported the imposition of sanctions requiring the wife to pay $1,500 of the husband’s attorney fees.

      <p>
       Trial court erred when it sanctioned the husband under G.S. 50-21(e), finding that the husband’s refusal to accept the wife’s valuation of the business resulted in a willful obstruction of the case where the trial court summarily recast the improper assessment of expert witness costs as a sanction against the husband, where the husband was given no notice that he would be subject to sanctions, and in fact, the notice sent to the husband was misleading.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in awarding attorney’s fees to a wife in a dissolution proceeding because the trial court’s findings of fact were supported by competent evidence detailing the wife’s efforts to seek attachment of the husband’s wages and the husband’s failure to appear at any hearing in the matter, including court-ordered mediation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Wife’s due process rights were violated when sanctions were imposed for the wife’s willful obstruction and unreasonable delay of equitable distribution hearing because the wife did not receive notice required by G.S. 50-21(e); the husband did not make a written request for sanctions and the language cited by the husband as allegedly giving the wife notice appeared in the equitable distribution order a distributional factor, and not as grounds for sanctions.

         There is a strong public interest in providing fair, efficient, and swift judicial processes for establishing and enforcing child support obligations. Children are entitled to support from their parents, and court assistance is often required for the establishment and enforcement of parental support obligations.

         The State shall have laws that meet the federal requirements on expedited processes for obtaining and enforcing child support orders for purposes of federal reimbursement under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 66(a)(2). The Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services may waive the expedited process requirement with respect to one or more district court district as defined in G.S. 7A-133 on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of support order issuance and enforcement within the district.

         The State has a strong financial interest in complying with the expedited process requirement, and other requirements, of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, but the State would incur substantial expense in creating statewide an expedited child support process as defined by federal law.

     <p>
      When a child support case is before a child support hearing officer for enforcement of a child support order, the hearing officer has the same authority that a district court judge would have, except in cases of contempt. Orders that commit a party to jail for civil or criminal contempt for the nonpayment of child support, or for otherwise failing to comply with a child support order, may be entered only by a district court judge. When it appears to a hearing officer that there is probable cause for finding such contempt in a case before the child support hearing officer and that no other enforcement remedy would be effective or sufficient, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding probable cause and referring the case for hearing before a district court judge. The order may indicate the amount of payment the responsible parent may make, or other action he may take, or both, to comply with the child support order. If proof of compliance is made to the hearing officer within a time specified in the order, the hearing officer may cancel the referral of the contempt case to district court. Except as specifically limited by this section, a clerk or magistrate acting as a child support hearing officer retains all of the contempt powers he or she otherwise has by virtue of being a clerk or magistrate.

       It is the policy of this State to allow, by agreement of all parties, the arbitration of all issues arising from a marital separation or divorce, except for the divorce itself, while preserving a right of modification based on substantial change of circumstances related to alimony, child custody, and child support. Pursuant to this policy, the purpose of this Article is to provide for arbitration as an efficient and speedy means of resolving these disputes, consistent with Chapters 50, 50A, 50B, 51, 52, 52B, and 52C of the General Statutes and similar legislation, to provide default rules for the conduct of arbitration proceedings, and to assure access to the courts of this State for proceedings ancillary to this arbitration.

       Plain language of the Family Law Arbitration Act (FLAA) itself provides a mechanism for vacating an arbitration award upon proof of fraud. G.S. 50-53, 50-54. Clear and convincing evidence is needed to succeed on a motion to vacate based on allegations of fraud. Given this high standard, and the concealment and deception inherent in fraud, post-confirmation discovery naturally follows.

       Although a husband argued the fraction an arbitrator used to determine the marital portion of the husband’s retirement plan account was not in accordance with the directive of G.S. 50-20.1(d), the arbitrator’s determination was not an evident mistake under the Family Law Arbitration Act, G.S. 50-55(a)(1), because even though the husband worked for the employer from 1977 through 2000, the husband only participated in the plan from 1989 through 2000; the husband determined the award was to be premised upon the time the marriage existed, simultaneous with the employment that earned the benefit, for a total of 34 months, as compared to the time the husband participated in the retirement plan, 123 months.

      <p>
       Language, “a judgment entered pursuant to provisions of this Article,” suggests the courts construe “judgment” in pari materia and identify other uses of the term in the Family Law Arbitration Act; in G.S. 50-57(a) and 50-59(a), “judgment” refers to a court’s final ruling after confirmation, modification, or correction of the arbitration award and, thus, a “judgment entered pursuant to provisions of this Article,” is a final judgment, similar to the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act.
