        Power of Eminent Domain Is Attribute of Sovereignty. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of eminent domain is one of the attributes of a sovereign state. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 675 (1962).

        Eminent Domain Exists Independently of Constitutional Provisions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to take private property for public use exists independently of constitutional provisions. In fact, such provisions are limitations on the State’s power to exercise the right. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 675 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Eminent Domain Is Exclusively in Control of Legislature. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The method of taking land for a public use is within the exclusive control of the legislature, limited by organic law, and the courts cannot help the injured landowner, where the statute has been strictly followed, until the question of compensation is reached. Durham v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 128</cite>, 53 S.E. 531, 1906 N.C. LEXIS 80 (1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain is possessed by the government,
   
   and may be exercised by the legislature or under its authority. It is peculiarly fit to be wielded by the legislature, as it is a power founded on necessity. Raleigh &amp; G.R.R. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 451</cite>, 1837 N.C. LEXIS 56 (1837).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Unless Properly Delegated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to exercise the power of eminent domain belongs to every independent government exercising sovereign power, as a necessary incident to its sovereignty, and this power, unless otherwise provided in the organic law, rests solely in the State unless by legislative action the power is delegated, the purposes for which it may be exercised enumerated, and the procedure for such exercise prescribed. Town of Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525, 1952 N.C. LEXIS 378 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Reason for Eminent Domain. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain is granted because the public interest requires that private property shall be taken for public use under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by law. Raleigh, C. &amp; S.R.R. v. Mecklenburg Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 168</cite>, 82 S.E. 5, 1914 N.C. LEXIS 363 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public necessity alone justifies governmental taking of private property.
   
   State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126, 1965 N.C. LEXIS 986 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of eminent domain cannot be implied
   
   or inferred from vague or doubtful language. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970, 1910 N.C. LEXIS 20 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the statute is silent on the subject it is to be presumed that the legislature intended that the necessary property should be obtained by contract. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970, 1910 N.C. LEXIS 20 (1910).

        Meaning of “Eminent Domain”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “eminent domain” mean the power of the sovereign or some agency authorized by it to take private property for public use. VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318, 1963 N.C. LEXIS 527 (1963).

        Eminent Domain Not Intended Absent Provision for Compensation. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a statute makes no provision for compensation, it is to be presumed that the legislature did not intend that the power of eminent domain should be exercised. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970, 1910 N.C. LEXIS 20 (1910).

        Impairment of Property Rights Unconstitutional Unless Compensation Provided. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A statutory amendment to a former statute which destroyed and sensibly impaired vested property rights acquired under the former statute or which attempted to transfer them either to the public or any other, except under the principles of eminent domain and upon compensation duly made, was unconstitutional and invalid. Watts v. Lenoir &amp; Blowing Rock, Tpk. Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 129</cite>, 106 S.E. 497, 1921 N.C. LEXIS 30 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of “property” is broad enough to include profits ` prendre,
   
   requiring just compensation to the owner of that interest when the right to enter upon lands is lost through condemnation. In re Lee, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 354 S.E.2d 759, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2597 (1987).

        Inclusion of Equipment Within Definition of Property. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error for trial court to allow testimony about the value of the property to be taken which included various equipment present on the property, as the authority proposing to take the property never specifically excluded this equipment from its taking, and it could be included within the definition of property in G.S. 40A-2(7). Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth. v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 564 S.E.2d 71, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 584 (2002).

        Diversion of Water as a “Taking”. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Diversion of the natural flow and drainage of streams and surface waters incident to the construction of a highway, resulting in the periodic flooding of the lands of a proprietor, is a “taking” of property for which just compensation must be paid. Braswell v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 508</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 912, 1959 N.C. LEXIS 687 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly applied the common law doctrine of riparian rights to determine that a public water authority had taken property owners’ riparian rights and that the owners were entitled to compensation for the taking because the owners were able to present evidence at trial that the authority’s diversion of water had reduced and would continue to reduce the natural rate of flow in a river, and nothing in the impoundment statutes, G.S. 143-215.44 to 143-215.50, or a North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) certificate stated that the authority was not obligated to pay just compensation; the impoundment statutes and the EMC certificate authorized the authority to exercise its power of eminent domain by diverting the water flow in the river in order to develop a public water supply, but just because the authority was authorized to exercise its powers of eminent domain, it did not follow that the authority was relieved of the constitutional mandate to compensate those whose property was taken. L&amp;S Water Power, Inc. v. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 712 S.E.2d 146, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 734 (2011).

      <p>
       A tenant having month-to-month tenancy based upon periodic rental payments without a written document is considered to be an “owner” as defined by this section, and has standing to challenge a condemnation proceeding itself as arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Calco Enters., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 511 S.E.2d 671, <cite class="nc_code">1999 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 104 (1999).

       Digging a ditch across private land to drain a public road amounts to a taking
   
   of private property for a public use. State v. New, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 731</cite>, 41 S.E. 1033, 1902 N.C. LEXIS 151 (1902).

      <p>
       Statute giving power to overseers of roads to cut poles on adjacent land
   
   was an instance of the exercise on the part of the sovereign of the right to take private property for the use of the public upon making compensation. Collins v. Creecy, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 333</cite>, 1861 N.C. LEXIS 26 (1861).

       Where a landowner has granted a right-of-way over his land, he must look to his contract for compensation,

       <p>
        Reference to G.S. 40A-3(b) and (c) in G.S. 40A-51(a) makes most sense as a simple delineation of the range of entities against whom a statutory inverse condemnation action can be brought rather than a description of the motivations underlying the acts or omissions necessary for the existence of a claim; the plain meaning of the reference to G.S. 40A-3(b) and (c) in G.S. 40A-51(a) is to specify the entities against whom a statutory inverse condemnation claim can be asserted. Wilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 540</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 853, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 67 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a condemning entity must establish that a proposed taking will further a public purpose before a condemnation can be authorized, there is no reason why a reciprocal burden to establish the existence of a public purpose should be imposed upon a property owner who has been deprived of his or her property by governmental action taken for a non-public purpose. Wilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 540</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 853, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 67 (2018).

       <p>
        In the exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain, private property can be taken only for a public use and upon the payment of just compensation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126, 1965 N.C. LEXIS 986 (1965).

         Meaning of “Public Use”. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        “Public use,” as applied in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, is not capable of a precise definition applicable to all situations. The term is elastic, and keeps pace with changing conditions, since the progressive demands of society and changing concepts of governmental duties and functions are constantly bringing new subjects forward as being for “public use.” State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126, 1965 N.C. LEXIS 986 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory phrase “the public use or benefit” is incapable of a precise definition applicable to all situations. Rather, because of the progressive demands of an ever-changing society and the perpetually fluid concept of governmental duty and function, the phrase is elastic and keeps pace with the changing times. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399, 1988 N.C. LEXIS 100 (1988).

         Test of Public Use or Benefit. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        On judicial determination of whether a condemnor’s intended use is an action for “the public use or benefit” under this section, courts in this and other states have employed essentially two approaches to this problem. The first approach — the public use test — asks whether the public has a right to a definite use of the condemned property. The second approach — the public benefit test — asks whether some benefit accrues to the public as a result of the desired condemnation. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399, 1988 N.C. LEXIS 100 (1988).

         Question of Law. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While the delegation of the power of eminent domain is for the legislature, the determination of whether a condemnor’s intended use of the land is for “the public use or benefit” is a question of law for the courts. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399, 1988 N.C. LEXIS 100 (1988).
       </p>

        Expansion of sewer service constituted an action for the public use, and a city validly exercised its power of eminent domain to condemn a sewer easement over land because the easement area would be available to the public at large; using the eminent domain power to connect the city’s property to the sewer pump station under the owner’s property benefited the public because there was no sewer access on the city’s property, and extending the sewer lines would allow the development of the land.

       Situations may change and condemned property may not always be used for the purpose that gave rise to the original condemnation proceeding. When a town in good faith initiates condemnation proceedings for a public use and in accord with legal requirements, the fact that some obstacle may potentially derail the intended use will not defeat that purpose.

     <p>
      Any condemnor without having filed a petition or complaint, depositing any sum or taking any other action provided for in this Chapter, is authorized to enter upon any lands, but not structures, to make surveys, borings, examinations, and appraisals as may be necessary or expedient in carrying out and performing its rights or duties under this Chapter. The condemnor shall give 30 days’ notice in writing to the owner at his last known address and the party in possession of the land of the intended entry authorized by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Entry under this section shall not be deemed a trespass or taking within the meaning of this Chapter, however, the condemnor shall make reimbursement for any damage resulting from such activities, and the owner is entitled to bring an action to recover for the damage. If the owner recovers damages of twenty-five percent (25%) over the amount offered by the condemnor for reimbursement for its activities the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney fees to the owner.

       In an action to recover damages for the taking of land for use as a sidewalk by defendant municipality, where the jury found plaintiff was entitled to recover nothing, the court could properly tax the costs against the defendant.

The petition shall be signed and verified. If filed by the condemnor, it must contain a description of the property which the condemnor seeks to acquire; and it must state that the condemnor is duly incorporated, and that it is its intention in good faith to conduct and carry on the public business authorized by its charter, stating in detail the nature of its public business, and the specific use of the property; and that the property described in the petition is required for the purpose of conducting the proposed business. The petition, if filed by the condemnor, must also contain a statement as to whether the owner will be permitted to remove all or a specified portion of any buildings, structures, permanent improvements, or fixtures situated on or affixed to the land. The petition, whether filed by the condemnor or the owner, must also state the names and places of residence of all other owners, so far as the same can by reasonable diligence be ascertained, or those who claim to be owners of the property. If any such persons are infants, their ages, as near as may be known, must be stated; and if any such persons are incompetents, inebriates or are unknown, that fact must be stated, together with any other allegations and statements of liens or encumbrances on the property which the condemnor or the owner may see fit to make.

       <p>
        The owner’s right to have the land appraised must necessarily be predicated upon a taking of the property by the corporation possessing the right of eminent domain. And “taking” under the power of eminent domain may be defined as entering upon private property for more than a momentary period, and, under warrant or color of legal authority, devoting it to a public use, or otherwise informally appropriating or injuriously affecting it in such a way as substantially to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment thereof.

        Owner may not maintain a proceeding for the assessment of damages until there has been a taking of his property under the power of eminent domain; hence, demurrer to a petition was properly sustained when its allegations amounted to no more than that respondent had threatened to take an easement and had made preliminary surveys incidental thereto, since in such instance the petition failed to allege a taking of the property.

       In a special proceeding to condemn land for urban renewal, the clerk of superior court does not have authority to issue an order appointing commissioners of appraisal where respondents deny the allegations of the petition; the record must show that after a proper hearing the controverted facts had been determined in favor of petitioner, the clerk’s finding that commissioners should be appointed not being a sufficient finding of the controverted facts.

        A commissioners’ report that simply stated that the commissioners met on a certain day in the office of the clerk and subsequently visited the premises of the defendant, and after taking into full consideration the quality and quantity of the land involved, and all inconveniences likely to result to defendant from the condemnation of the rights-of-way, asserted the damages at zero, did not purport to show any hearing by the commissioners of the proofs and allegations of the parties, as required both by law and by the order of the clerk.

       <p>
        In estimating the fair market value of property acquired by eminent domain, all of the capabilities of the property and all of the uses to which it may be applied or for which it is adapted which affect its value in the market are to be considered, and not merely the condition it is in at the time and the use to which it is then applied by the owner.

       </p>
       <p>
        Matters such as the accessibility of the property, its slope and elevation, and the costs that will be involved for necessary grading and filling are often important factors to be considered in arriving at an opinion as to its value.

       </p>
       <p>
        The use of property in combination with other property may be considered
   
   as a basis for awarding damages if the possibility of combination is so reasonably sufficient and the use so reasonably probable as to affect the market value. City of Statesville v. Bowles, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 169 S.E.2d 467, <cite class="nc_code">1969 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1149 (1969).

       Whether property involved in a voluntary sale is sufficiently similar in nature, location, and condition to the property appropriated by condemnation to admit evidence of its sale and the price paid therefor as a guide to the value of the condemned property is a question to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of his sound discretion.

     <p>
      In case any property required by a condemnor shall be vested in any trustee not authorized to sell, release and convey the same, or in any infant, incompetent, or inebriate, the superior court shall have power, by a special proceeding, on petition, to authorize and empower such trustee or the general guardian or committee of such infant, incompetent or inebriate, to sell and convey the same to such condemnor, on such terms as may be just. In case any infant, incompetent or inebriate has no general guardian or committee, the court may appoint a special guardian or committee for the purpose of making a sale, release or conveyance, and may require security from the general or special guardian or committee as the court may deem proper. Before any conveyance or release authorized by this section shall be executed, the terms on which it is to be executed shall be reported to the court on oath. If the court is satisfied that the terms are just to the owner of the property, the court shall confirm the report and direct the proper conveyance or release to be executed, which shall have the same effect as if executed by an owner of the property having legal power to sell and convey the same.

       Purpose of former G.S. 40-23 (similar to this section) is to prevent a corporation, having the right of eminent domain, from being indefinitely postponed in acquiring title and going on with its work or from being subjected to a succession of suits for compensation, and under its provisions, the company acquires the right-of-way and the court distributes the compensation.

       The phrase “adverse and conflicting claimants” is limited to those who assert adverse titles to the property and hence a conflict in interest as to the party entitled to the sum awarded, or those who are in agreement as to their respective titles but are in disagreement as to the value of their respective estates and hence the proportion of the award to which each is entitled.

       Because a sewer line connecting a landfill and to a public sewer system would be used by at least seven other users, and potentially 28 additional property owners, and because the county was not required by G.S. 40A-40(a) to give notice as to all the planned or potential users of the sewer line, the sewer line was properly found to be for a public purpose.

       Defendant’s decision to estimate that no compensation was required did not violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights requiring just compensation because defendant adequately estimated that the benefit received by the project was sufficient compensation, and the issue of whether that was reasonable was more properly left for the condemnation hearing; defendant’s estimate of no compensation adequately satisfied the notice requirement of G.S. 40A-40.

      <p>
       It was error to grant a town judgment notwithstanding a verdict in a condemnation case on a theory that the public trust doctrine made the taking noncompensable because (1) the theory was not raised on directed verdict, (2) the sua sponte order was entered months after final judgment, and (3) the town was estopped from asserting the town possessed rights taken as the town’s complaint said the town did not, the town did not raise the issue at an “all other issues” hearing, at which the town disavowed the public trust doctrine, the town did not immediately appeal a vital ruling that the town condemned the property, and landowners introduced a scintilla of supporting evidence.

       Decision to provide a claimant whose property has been taken for a public purpose with a statutory inverse condemnation remedy while depriving a claimant who has suffered the same injury for a non-public purpose of the right to utilize that statutory remedy seems inconsistent with the likely legislative intent; a number of relevant canons of statutory construction provide support for the manner in which the supreme court believes the “plain meaning” of subsection (a) should be understood.

       Although a condemning entity must establish that a proposed taking will further a public purpose before a condemnation can be authorized, there is no reason why a reciprocal burden to establish the existence of a public purpose should be imposed upon a property owner who has been deprived of his or her property by governmental action taken for a non-public purpose.

       No simple test exists for determining when a taking occurs by aircraft overflights;

      <p>
       Plaintiffs’ allegation of a very general taking by aircraft overflights “within the past two years”
   
   failed to allege with reasonable specificity when the alleged appropriation or taking occurred; however, rather than dismissing the complaint altogether, the court should have required plaintiffs to come forward in accordance with defendant’s motion for a more definite statement and plead the facts which they possessed, so that the court could then rule on their timeliness and sufficiency.

       A citizen must surrender his private property in obedience to the necessities of a growing and progressive state, but in doing so he is entitled to be paid full, fair and ample compensation, to be reduced only by such benefits as are special and peculiar to his land. He has the right to have and enjoy the general benefits which are common to him and to his neighbors, without being required to pay therefor merely because it so happens that the use of his land is necessary for the needs of the public.

       The measure of damages or just compensation to be paid to the landowner is the difference in the fair market value of the land immediately before the taking and the fair market value immediately after the taking of the easement. Duke Power Co. v. Ribet, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 87, 212 S.E.2d 182, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2178 (1975).

      <p>
       For the purpose of determining the sum to be paid as compensation for land taken under the right of eminent domain, the value of the land taken should be ascertained as of the date of the taking, which is when the proceeding is begun. City of King's Mountain v. Goforth, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 316</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 231, 1973 N.C. LEXIS 961 (1973).

       Trial court did not err in awarding final judgment for a county water and sewer district in its condemnation action against a landowner because the trial court’s finding that the landowner did not file an answer within 120 days of service of the complaint pursuant to G.S. 40A-46 supported the conclusion of law that $ 12,000 was just compensation for the taking of the landowner’s property; the statutory procedure set forth in G.S. 40A-64 to determine just compensation is not applicable where a defendant waives the issue of just compensation by failing to file an answer within the time limits proscribed by G.S. 40A-46.

       In a condemnation action by an airport authority, the testimony of the condemnee’s expert witness as to the property’s highest and best use as if it had not been under a “cloud of condemnation” was proper. Since a property owner cannot capitalize on any increase in the property’s value due to the reasonable likelihood that it will be acquired, the condemnor likewise cannot take advantage of any resulting decrease in the property due to the threat of condemnation.

       Fact that the value of condemned property was decreased by an ordinance passed by an entity that was different from the entity that sought to condemn the property did not preclude the application of G.S. 40A-65, preventing the use of the decreased value as the property’s value for condemnation purposes, where the ordinance decreasing the property’s value was caused by the purpose for which the property was condemned.

       When landowners asserted that a decrease in the value of their property, due its inclusion in a “no-development” zone, pursuant to a county ordinance, was caused by the water development project for which the property was condemned by a water authority, the landowners were not collaterally attacking the ordinance.

       When the value of landowners’ property was decreased by its inclusion in a “no-development” zone created pursuant to a county ordinance to protect the watershed for a proposed reservoir, and the water authority subsequently sought to condemn the property, the ordinance causing a decrease in the property’s value resulted from the reservoir project; thus, the landowners could introduce evidence of the value of the property before the ordinance was enacted, in the condemnation proceeding.

       If a holder of a conservation easement contests an action to condemn property encumbered by a conservation easement on the basis that the condemnor failed to sufficiently consider alternatives to the action or that a prudent and feasible alternative exists to the action, the holder of the conservation easement may file an answer to the complaint within 30 days from the date of service of the complaint as to that issue. If the holder of the conservation easement does not assert that the condemnor failed to sufficiently consider alternatives to the action or that a prudent and feasible alternative exists to the action, the holder of the conservation easement may file an answer within 120 days from the date of service of the complaint.

       If the holder of a conservation easement contests an action pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the judge shall hear and determine whether or not a prudent and feasible alternative exists to condemnation of the property. The burden of persuasion on this issue is on the condemnor if the holder of the conservation easement, after discovery, has identified at least one alternative. If no alternative identified by the holder of the conservation easement is adjudged prudent and feasible, then the condemnation action shall proceed under the provisions of Article 3 of this Chapter, or Article 9 of Chapter 136 of the General Statutes, as applicable. If the judge determines that a prudent and feasible alternative does exist to condemnation of the property, the court shall dismiss the action and award the holder of the conservation easement costs, disbursements, and expenses in accordance with G.S. 40A-8(b) or G.S. 136-119, as applicable, except that attorneys’ fees may not be awarded. The procedure for this hearing shall be as set forth in G.S. 40A-47 or G.S. 136-108, as applicable.

     <p>
      In any action to condemn property encumbered by a conservation easement, the court shall determine just compensation pursuant to Article 4 of this Chapter or in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html" target="_blank">Chapter 136</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as applicable, by first determining the value of the property taken as a whole, unencumbered by the conservation easement, as well as any other, separately owned interest in the property. The court shall allocate the just compensation award between or among any holders of the conservation easement and any owners of the property as provided by the easement agreement or, if the agreement fails to address the issue, as the judge finds equitable based upon evidence to include the opinion of a real estate valuation expert with experience in the valuation of conservation easements. Any party may demand trial by jury on the issue of total just compensation for the taking.
