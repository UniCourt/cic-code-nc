                    Initiative at designated schools and shall appoint the Child and Family Team Leaders, who shall be a school nurse and a school social worker. Each local management entity that has any selected schools in its catchment area shall appoint
                    a Care Coordinator, and any department of social services that has a selected school in its catchment area shall appoint a Child and Family Teams Facilitator. The Care Coordinators and Child and Family Team Facilitators shall have
                    as their sole responsibility working with the selected schools in their catchment areas and shall provide training to school-based personnel, as required. The Child and Family Team Leaders shall identify and screen children who are
                    potentially at risk of academic failure or out-of-home placement due to physical, social, legal, emotional, or developmental factors. Based on the screening results, responsibility for developing, convening, and implementing the Child
                    and Family Team Initiative is as follows:

                        None of the purposes of the Juvenile Code were met by subjecting a child’s family to Department of Social Services supervision because of an adult relative’s abuse of the child in his home during a sleepover because an adjudication of abuse and neglect
                        neither promoted the child’s best interest nor protected her mother’s fundamental right to parent her child; the child’s mother and stepfather took appropriate steps to ensure the child’s safety. In re R.R.N.,

                        When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court’s order transferring a child’s custody from a department of social services to foster parents was entered eight months late, this resulted in protracted custody proceedings that left the legal relationship
                        between parent and child unresolved and left the child in legal limbo, thwarting the legislature’s wish that children be placed in safe, permanent homes within a reasonable amount of time, as stated in G.S. 7B-100(5). In re L.L.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 689, 616 S.E.2d 392, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1798 (2005).

                        In dependency proceedings, to hold that the failure of a department of social services to list the address of an allegedly dependent child in a petition under G.S. 7B-402, or that the department’s failure to file an affidavit required by G.S. 50A-209(a)
                        could prevent a trial court from acquiring subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile action, would be to elevate form over substance; such a holding would additionally impose jurisdictional limitations that the general assembly
                        clearly never intended in G.S. 7B-100(3) when it sought to balance the interests of children with the rights of parents in juvenile actions. In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>, 646 S.E.2d

                        Contrary to the mother’s assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                        to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother’s parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,

                        The common thread running throughout the Juvenile Code, G.S. 7B-100 et seq., is that the court’s primary concern must be the child’s best interest; a child’s interest in being protected from abuse and neglect is paramount to his parents’ constitutional
                        interest in the custody of their child. In re Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 561 S.E.2d 560, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 303 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S.

                        Holding that G.S. 7B-1003 did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to grant a motion for termination of parental rights that was filed during the pendency of an appeal from the trial court’s dispositional order was consistent with the purposes of
                        the Juvenile Code because the holding minimized procedural delay unnecessary to protect parental rights that interfered with addressing a child’s needs. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>,

                        Trial court’s conclusion that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because it properly considered the statutory factors; the trial court found that the conduct of the mother
                        and father demonstrated that they would not promote the child’s health, physical, and mental well-being and that the child was no closer to returning home than she was on the day she entered into the care of the department of social
                        services. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 16, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 625 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Court properly terminated a father’s parental rights because the father’s choices and actions resulted in a lengthy delay in his projected release date from incarceration and significantly limited his access to classes, programs, services, and employment
                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court’s findings of fact regarding the father’s failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                    <p>
                        While one of the essential aims of the Juvenile Code is to reunite a parent with a child after the child is taken from the parent’s custody, reunification may not always be a viable option. A trial court did not fail to consider the purpose and legislative
                        intent of G.S. 7B-100(4) when it terminated a mother’s parental rights after finding clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that supported neglect as a ground for termination. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite>                        424, 588 S.E.2d 555, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2181 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Goal of G.S. 7B-100(5) is to place children in safe, permanent houses within a reasonable time, and allowing parents to delay termination proceedings by appealing custody review orders would have thwarted G.S. 7B-100(5); G.S. 7B-1003 did not deprive the
                        trial court of jurisdiction to terminate the mother’s parental rights during the pendency of the custody review order appeal as G.S. 7B-1003 applied only to dependency proceedings, not to termination proceedings. In re R.T.W.,

                        There are certain constitutional rights which a juvenile has at a juvenile hearing which are not required in civil trials, such as the right to counsel if there is a possibility of commitment and the privilege against self incrimination. This would suggest

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in quashing s mother’s subpoena for her child’s testimony because its decision to quash the subpoena was based on a reasonable weighing of the relevance of the child’s testimony and the detrimental effect that
                        testifying would have on the child; the trial court’s evidentiary rulings assured fairness and equality and provided the mother with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the termination proceeding. In re A.H.,

                        In concluding that a stepfather’s cousin was a child’s caretaker, the trial court stretched G.S. 7B-101(3) beyond its intended scope, as the stepfather’s cousin was simply a relative who sexually assaulted the child while the child was under the cousin’s
                        temporary supervision. The trial court erred in applying the Juvenile Code on these facts and in adjudicating the child abused and neglected. In re R.R.N., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 647,

                        with her care; the child’s mother and stepfather responded appropriately, and thus, the abuse of the child by the adult relative did not warrant the State’s intrusion into the family unit. In re R.R.N.,

                        Although the term “community-based program” is a term of art, its usage by the General Assembly reflects its concern that responses to the problems of the juveniles coming before the courts be fashioned in a flexible manner so as to address the best interests
                        of the child in ways other than probation and commitment to training schools (now youth development centers). In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 861, 1981 N.C. LEXIS 1026

                        Trial court erred in adjudicating a mother’s three-month-old son as dependent, pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(9), as the trial court’s finding of fact that the mother was not willing to investigate the needs of her son in a safe environment, after the infant
                        suffered a severe head trauma while in the father’s sole care, was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; as the mother did not neglect her son, nor was he deemed abused, he was not dependent because he had a parent capable
                        of providing care and supervision. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 617 S.E.2d 325, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1785 (2005).

                        Children were dependent where the parents were neither able to care for them nor did they suggest appropriate alternate replacements; the father’s proposed replacement was insufficient because there was no evidence that his aunt was willing or able to
                        care for the children. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 615 S.E.2d 26, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1268 (2005).

                        Trial court’s findings supported its conclusion that the children were dependent under G.S. 7B-101(9) because it found that the mother could not care for her children without constant assistance, and that such assistance was not available to her. In re

                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record supported the findings that the minor child was dependent as defined by G.S. 7B-101, the mother failed to show the ability to properly parent the minor child and attend to his special needs, and the
                        mother had not seen the minor child since January 2007 and had not given gifts or support or shown any love or affection for the child since she last saw him. The findings in turn supported the trial court’s conclusions that the
                        minor child was dependent and abandoned, both of which are statutory grounds for termination. In re J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 681 S.E.2d 485, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1374 (2009).

                        Evidence supported termination of the father’s parental rights; the child had been placed in the custody of Youth and Family Services (YFS) as a result of being adjudicated dependent, and the conditions which led to the child being placed in YFS custody
                        were not necessarily tied to the fault of either parent, and instead, those conditions were based entirely on circumstances surrounding the child at the time he was adjudicated dependent, and the father made almost no effort to
                        either establish himself as a parent who could provide for the child, nor did he arrange alternative child care arrangements. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 765 S.E.2d 111,

                        Trial court’s finding of fact that the child’s mother had not appropriately cared for him was not supported by clear and convincing evidence; similarly, the finding of fact that the mother was not willing to investigate the needs of the child in a safe
                        environment was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Further, the child was not neglected as to his mother; therefore, pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(9), the child was not dependent as to his mother because she was capable
                        of providing care for and supervision of the child. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1091 (N.C. Ct.

                        Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father’s incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                        to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court’s finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                        a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court’s finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not required
                        to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 33 (2020).

                        Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile’s adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child’s adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                        was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father’s parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 645</cite>,

                        Termination of the mother’s rights on the grounds of neglect was supported by substantial evidence; the trial court determined that mother’s last-minute progress was insufficient to outweigh her long-standing history of alcohol and substance abuse and
                        domestic violence, as well as the impact these behaviors had on the children, and it was not error for the trial court to find that there likely would be a repetition of neglect in the future should they be returned to mother’s

                        to drug screens, and attending visitations, all of which reflected her inability to provide the juvenile proper care and supervision in a safe home environment, the juvenile had spent half of his life in Department of Social Services
                        custody, and the mother’s prior neglect of the juvenile and her circumstances at the time of the termination hearing supported the trial court’s conclusion that the juvenile faced a significant likelihood of future neglect if returned

                        The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without authority to enter

                        In dependency proceedings brought under G.S. 7B-101, the failure of a petition to list an allegedly dependent juvenile’s address pursuant to G.S. 7B-402 did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction because this was “routine clerical information,” and
                        the trial court could easily determine from information provided in the petition whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. In re A.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 392</cite>,

                        did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker’s verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court
                        to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2447 (2007).

                        In a case in which the court appointed custodians of a minor child filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child’s mother, the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the custodians lacked standing. The custodians did not fit within any
                        of the requirements under G.S. 7B-1103(a), and contrary to their argument, their status as custodians of the minor child did not give them the same rights as a guardian; G.S. 7B-1103 referred to both custody and guardianship, and
                        it could not be held that the words custody and judicially appointed guardian as used in G.S. 7B-1103 were not intended to have specific, distinct meanings.

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother’s petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the
                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child’s medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        Abandonment imports any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Abandonment has also been defined as willful neglect and refusal
                        to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support. It has been held that if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, the opportunity to display filial affection, and willfully neglects to lend
                        support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 332, 296 S.E.2d 811 (1982).

                        Child with a severe speech defect which could be treated by medical or other remedial care, as well as a hearing defect, which problems could be overcome with proper treatment and therapy which were available to child without expense to her mother, was
                        “neglected” where her mother refused to permit her to receive this opportunity to progress toward her full development. In re Huber, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C.

                        A finding of neglect by clear and convincing evidence was proper where the children were kept at home, and they did not receive proper medical care, supervision, or adequate nutrition.

                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a conclusion that a child did not receive proper care and supervision, and that the neglect was likely to result in physical, mental, or emotional impairment, or a substantial risk of such impairment under
                        G.S. 7B-101(15) as: (1) a mother had over two years to work on a case plan with a department of social services and had ample time to follow through with the services designed to assist her in learning to parent; (2) the mother
                        had attended only one mental health appointment and had not participated in vocational rehabilitation; (3) a father missed a psychological evaluation despite a social worker’s efforts to provide transportation; (4) the service
                        providers were unable to make contact with the parents; and (5) the parents delayed seeking medical attention for the child after a social worker telephoned the father and told him about the need to take the child to a pediatrician.

                        Even accepting the parents’ argument that they did not inflict a child’s broken ribs, because they either failed to notice their baby’s extensive injuries and pain, or noticed but ignored them, their failure to obtain medical attention constituted neglect
                        per G.S. 7B-101(15). In re S.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 653 S.E.2d 425, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2438 (2007).

                        Trial court did not err in adjudicating the second child dependent and neglected as the mother was unable to provide for the second child’s care or supervision and lacked an appropriate alternative child care arrangement, and her actions placed the child
                        at a substantial risk of some physical, mental, or emotional impairment because, while the second child was in the mother’s custody, she continuously failed to obtain meaningful mental health services for the child that could have
                        prevented or mitigated the child’s need for repeated hospitalizations at a psychiatric hospital; she greatly minimized and denied the seriousness of the child’s condition; and the mother even exacerbated the child’s condition.

                        Failure of parents, during the three months additional time allowed to them to make improvements, to provide a clean and suitable home for their children and to provide for appropriate child care when they were absent, was strong supporting evidence for

                        Trial court did not err by concluding that grounds existed to terminate a father’s parental rights because the evidence and findings of fact supported its determination that the father lacked the willingness or ability to establish a safe home for his
                        child; the father’s parental rights to another child had been involuntarily terminated, and his mental health concerns did not allow him to provide a safe home. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>,

                        Neglect may be manifested in ways less tangible than failure to provide physical necessities. Therefore, on the question of neglect, the trial judge may consider, in addition, a parent’s complete failure to provide the personal contact, love, and affection
                        that inheres in the parental relationship. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 296 S.E.2d 811, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3123 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court’s findings of fact support its legal conclusions that the juveniles were neglected, the lack of findings in the adjudication order regarding the mother’s fault or culpability in contributing to the adjudication of neglect was immaterial.
                        In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 774 S.E.2d 316, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 515 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on neglect was proper; issues of inappropriate discipline and domestic violence remained, the mother had not secured her own housing, and the findings supported the conclusion that there was a high probability
                        of the repetition of neglect if the children were returned to the mother’s care. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 614 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Even assuming findings in the trial court’s prior orders sufficed to support the corresponding adjudicatory findings, the findings did not support the conclusion that the children were neglected juveniles; the fact that the mother verbally attacked the
                        school bus driver and blocked children from boarding did not support a neglect determination, nor did the children’s absences from school, which did not show the children were being denied an education. In re J.C.M.J.C.,

                        Unchallenged findings were sufficient to support a conclusion that the child was neglected where they established that the mother’s improper care of the child and repeated allegations of sexual abuse exposed the child to harmful medical procedures, creating
                        an environment injurious to her welfare. In re E.P.-L.M., <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 847 S.E.2d 427, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 587 (2020).

                        Grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental rights based on neglect where although the father had made some progress toward completing his court-ordered case plan, his success was extremely limited and insufficient in light of the child’s placement
                        in state custody for over two years. In re J.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 772</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 44, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 628 (2020).

                        the child suffered acute alcohol intoxication, the findings of fact in the trial court’s order did not support its conclusion of law that the child was a neglected juvenile because the findings, such as they were, supported a determination
                        that a tragic and unfortunate accident occurred — an accident which might have been preventable with the benefit of hindsight, but which the mother had no way of knowing would occur, nor had any means to prevent it, absent some

                        The petitioner offered substantial evidence sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss where the evidence presented, taken in the light most favorable to petitioner, amounted to the following: (1) that respondent’s eight year-old daughter had been left
                        alone for approximately three and a half hours by respondent as a form of discipline; (2) that she was found to have a cut on her lip and bruising on her face; (3) that respondent’s boyfriend had spanked her at church when she
                        misbehaved, and had grabbed her face and hit her face when they arrived home; (4) that respondent’s boyfriend had punched holes in the walls, and that he had once cracked the car windshield with his fist while the children were
                        in the vehicle; (5) that respondent was completely uncooperative with petitioner; (6) that respondent’s son had a wound on his upper lip which respondent insisted was a cold sore but was later determined to be an infected cut;
                        and (7) that respondent had a blackened eye. In re Gleisner, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 539 S.E.2d 362, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1308 (2000).

                        Although G.S. 7B-101(15) was silent on whether a juvenile to be adjudicated as neglected had to sustain some injury as a result of neglect, there had to be some physical, mental, or emotional impairment of the juvenile or a substantial risk of such impairment
                        as a consequence of the failure to provide proper care, supervision, or discipline; and where there was no finding that the juvenile had been impaired or was at substantial risk of impairment, there was no error if all the evidence
                        supported such a finding. In re Padgett, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 577 S.E.2d 337, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 324 (2003).

                        Trial court did not err in denying the mother and father’s motions to dismiss filed at the close of the county welfare agency’s case and the close of all of the evidence, as the evidence that the older daughter was abused and the younger daughter was
                        neglected was supported by evidence sufficient to withstand their motions to dismiss. In re Morales, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 583 S.E.2d 692, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1518 (2003).

                        There was ample clear, cogent and convincing evidence that a juvenile’s injuries were the result of nonaccidental means, that her injuries were “intentionally” inflicted upon her and that, therefore, she was neglected, despite mother’s alleged love and

                        with the child, supported the trial court’s conclusion that father “acted in such a way as to evince a lack of parental concern for the child” and were sufficient to constitute neglect pursuant to G.S. 7A-289.32(2) [see now G.S.

                        the trial court’s findings of fact, which included a 16 year old mother’s prior adjudication of neglect, marijuana use, and her demonstrated inability to care for an infant, supported the conclusion that the child was a neglected

                        sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother’s infant child based on the mother’s (1) whereabouts to have been unknown upon the baby’s discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana
                        since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her psychological problems, and (5) abuse and neglect adjudication regarding an older daughter. In re M.J.G.,

                        and homemaking, (2) obtain mental health counseling, (3) have a phone, or (4) keep a clean home, all as required by her case plan, and she offered no specific plan for the children’s care while she worked, if they were returned

                        neglected juveniles under G.S. 7B-101(15); the findings included instances of drug abuse and domestic violence by the mother and the father of one of her children.

                        Trial court’s conclusion that the father neglected both children because the minor children did not receive proper care or supervision and they lived in an environment injurious to their welfare was proper where the father admitted that he had been required
                        to call the police because the mother had been throwing things. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 706, 640 S.E.2d 817, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 378, aff'd,

                        Evidence sufficiently supported the trial court’s finding that the mother’s children were neglected, including that the mother delayed taking the one child for medical treatment for the one child’s bruises because of the mother’s fear that the county
                        social services agency would take custody of the children and that the other two children had disciplinary and developmental problems while in the mother’s care. In re C.P., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite>                        698, 641 S.E.2d 13, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 377 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in concluding that the minor child was a neglected juvenile, as the allegation in the petition that the minor child was neglected because the minor child lived in an environment injurious to the minor child’s welfare was proven
                        by clear and convincing evidence; indeed, the evidence showed that the minor child’s older sibling was adjudicated abused and neglected because the mother’s boyfriend, who was cohabitating with the mother at the time of the abuse,
                        pled guilty to several felony sex offenses. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 375 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Adjudication of neglect was supported by evidence that the mother admitted to “thumping” the five-year-old daughter in the face hard enough with a finger to leave a bruise shaped like the mother’s finger, the bruising of the four-year-old child’s upper
                        leg was from a severe blow delivered by his stepfather with a brush, respondents’ effort to convince the younger child to lie about what happened to cause the bruise on his leg, the fact that the older child told the social worker
                        that the bruise on her face came from falling in the bathtub, the same lie respondents tried to exact from the younger child, and the mother’s admission that she left the younger alone in the bathtub every night for 20 to 30 minutes.

                        Trial court properly adjudicated a child to be a neglected juvenile where the testimony showed that the mother had left the child alone in a motel room when she was only 16 months old.

                        Fact that the mother admitted to using cocaine for at least two months prior to the child’s birth, the mother and the child tested positive for cocaine at the time of the child’s birth, that there were incidents of domestic violence between respondents,
                        and that the mother refused to sign a safety assessment plan, provided clear and convincing evidence supporting a finding of neglect. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 643 S.E.2d

                        Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated because the district court’s findings that the mother changed employment every couple of months and had transportation problems that contributed to the mother’s employment issues and the mother’s difficulties
                        in visitation with all of her children supported a determination that the child at issue was neglected under G.S. 7B-101. In re J.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 341</cite>, 643 S.E.2d 579, 2007 N.C.

                        Sufficient evidence supported the conclusion that a mother neglected the mother’s child under G.S. 7B-101(15) and G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) because the mother failed to stop substance abuse after the children were removed from the home and failed to meet their
                        basic needs during a trial period. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 683 (2007).

                        Child living with the maternal grandmother at the time a county department of social services’ petition for neglect was filed was properly adjudicated neglected under G.S. 7B-101(15) because the relevant question was fitness of the child’s mother to care
                        for the child at the time of the proceedings; evidence showed the mother was not fit at that time. In re K.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 653, 692 S.E.2d 437, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 730 (2010).

                        Findings relating to the prior adjudication of neglect and subsequent termination of parental rights as to the parents’ first child and the parents’ failure to comply with their case plan, when combined with the parents’ failure to acknowledge culpability
                        for their first child’s injuries, supported the conclusion that the child was a neglected juvenile based on the high risk of future abuse or neglect.

                        Termination of a mother’s parental rights to her two minor children was upheld on appeal where the unchallenged findings of fact made by the trial court established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record that the mother had willfully
                        left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their placement. The findings supporting that conclusion included: the children were in foster care for over 12 months; the
                        mother missed seven out of eleven appointments and failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program; missed five out of ten parenting classes; tested positive for drugs several times; failed to establish a permanent residence
                        and had been moving around from family and friends for a total of eight separate residences; failed to obtain employment; and failed to stay in contact with the Department of Social Services. In re A.R.H.B.,

                        Termination of a father’s parental rights was upheld on appeal since the father failed to challenge any of the findings of fact made by the trial court, namely that prior to the date the motion to terminate his parental rights was filed, he never established
                        paternity over the minor child at issue, never legitimated the child by statute or marriage, nor had he provided any financial support. In re A.R.H.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 651

                        a required parenting program, failed to attend individual counseling, and failed to address her substance abuse issues, the evidence supported the conclusion that the children were neglected under G.S. 7B-101. In re D.B.,

                        Termination order was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence based on the mother’s unfitness to have custody, and the overwhelming evidence of neglect, including improper supervision of her children, inappropriate discipline, and the severely
                        unsanitary condition of the family’s home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they were
                        taken from the mother’s custody, termination was in the children’s best interests. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 716 (2008).

                        Clear and convincing evidence supported a trial court’s finding that a minor child was neglected and dependent pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15) because the child was in an injurious environment where her father continued to be present despite his agreement
                        to stay away; because the child’s mother was not seeking to enforce the Safety Assessment Plan the father signed, the county youth and family services found it necessary to obtain a Non-Secure Custody Order to protect the child.

                        that their child was neglected and that it was probable that the neglect would be repeated. In re D.D., <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 733 (N.C. Ct. App. June 16, 2009), op. withdrawn,

                        Finding of neglect as to the mother under G.S. 7B-101(15) was supported by, inter alia, evidence that one child was locked outside for the home for a significant period of time even though the mother was home, two children frequently missed school, and
                        the third child had not obtained routine immunizations and suffered from a yeast infection, eczema, and cradle cap. In re H.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C.

                        Findings of fact supported the trial court’s conclusion that the child was neglected pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(15) because, inter alia, the trial court found that the child’s sister, who lived in the same home, had been physically abused, that the child’s
                        parents had engaged in acts of domestic violence in the child’s presence, that the mother was subsequently attacked by the father, after which she received a domestic violence protective order but never ceased contact with the

                        Clear and convincing evidence showed that children were neglected because the children were substantially at risk due to (1) one child’s life-threatening injuries and the children’s parents’ explanations that were inconsistent with the injuries, (2) the
                        instability and volatility of the children’s living conditions, (3) the parents’ deceptive natures, and (4) living in an injurious environment that involved violence.

                        Sufficient evidence supported the termination of a mother’s parental rights because the child was properly found to be a neglected juvenile under G.S. 7B-101(15) since the mother failed to complete a substance abuse program and attended only 10 of 29
                        scheduled visits with the child and such neglect was likely to continue since the mother was engaged in substance abuse, lacked employment, and failed to obtain stable housing.

                        neglected if the mother regained custody; mother had failed to maintain a stable residence, was often in arrears on rent, and since August 31, 2006, there had been seven summary ejectment actions filed against the mother. In re

                        Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights to two children for neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) and G.S. 7B-101(15), despite the progress the father made in a rehabilitation program during his incarceration. The father had exhibited
                        a pattern of recovery and relapse regarding his addiction to crack-cocaine and marijuana, and the trial court properly considered that his success at rehabilitation while incarcerated was not indicative of how he would deal with
                        his addiction once released. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 715 S.E.2d 563, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1898 (2011).

                        Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a trial court’s termination of a mother’s parental rights to her four-year-old child, based on neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1), because the mother failed to maintain stable employment and housing, had
                        continued dependence on others to meet her basic needs, and the trial court had discretion to consider evidence that the mother’s older child had been adjudicated a neglected child, pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(15); since the mother’s
                        release from jail in April 2008, she had five jobs and eight residences. In re C.G.R., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 717 S.E.2d 50, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2239

                        Trial court did not err by concluding that children were neglected juveniles pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(15) because the children had never received any medical care while in the parents’ home, and the father had beaten one of the children; the trial court
                        properly considered evidence tending to show that the children’s younger sister was an abused or neglected juvenile in determining whether the father and mother had neglected the children, and its findings of fact clearly established
                        that the children lived in an environment that was injurious to their welfare. In re S.H., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 719 S.E.2d 157, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        Sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s adjudication of neglect of a five-year-old child because the mother no longer attended mental health therapy, declined free daycare, did not allow access to her records to determine whether she was compliant
                        with her mental health medication, and the mother’s refusal to cooperate with the Department of Social Services placed the child at risk of substantial harm; one erroneous finding of fact by the trial court, which was based on
                        hearsay, did not constitute reversible error. In re T.R.T., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 737 S.E.2d 823, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 171 (2013).

                        District court did not err when it adjudicated both children neglected juveniles because the mother placed the children at a substantial risk of physical, mental, or emotional impairment as a consequence of her failure to provide proper care, supervision,
                        or discipline as she felt so overwhelmed that she could not care for the children that she left them with their father, a person she believed was a substance abuser, without even interacting with him in person to assess his sobriety
                        and current fitness to care for the children; and the mother had disciplined the younger child in such an inappropriate manner that he had been adjudicated an abused juvenile and the mother was charged with misdemeanor child abuse.

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s determination that a child was a neglected juvenile was supported by the evidence because its findings supported the conclusion that the child was not receiving proper care and supervision under the mother’s care and that he was living in
                        an environment injurious to his welfare; the trial court found that the mother had problems with drugs and that she had previously injured the child while abusing drugs. In re J.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        63, 768 S.E.2d 172, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 43 (2015).

                        Evidence that the mother was physically assaulted by the father while pregnant and continued to allow the father to have contact with the children despite a protect order support a finding of neglect. In re J.W., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                        44, 772 S.E.2d 249, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 375 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Competent evidence supported the trial court’s findings in part that: the father engaged in aggressive and violent behaviors in the home, he hit one child in the mouth causing a busted lip, and he struck the other child at least once; these findings showed
                        that the children lived in an environment injurious to their welfare and that they were at a substantial risk of physical, mental, or emotional impairment. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>                        443, 774 S.E.2d 316, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 515 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Findings supported the conclusion that all four children were neglected, as there was ample evidence to support the finding that the mother sustained bruises from her fall after being pushed by the father, the trial court found that the youngest two children
                        did not need to be in the middle of a fight to be subjected to an injurious environment, and the evidence supported the finding that all four children knew about the physical altercations; the trial court did not act under a misapprehension
                        of the law, as the findings sufficiently detailed the impacts the father’s violence with the mother had on the children. In re M.K., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 773 S.E.2d 535,

                        Child was properly adjudicated as neglected because (1) the child’s male cousin’s sexual improprieties with the child showed a lack of proper care, and (2) the child was present when adults used marijuana, slept with the cousin, and was passed between
                        adults with no determination of fitness, showing substantial risk of harm. In re T.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 781 S.E.2d 93, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1041

                    <p>
                        Because the evidence supported the trial court’s findings that a minor child’s father indicated an unwillingness to enter into a family services agreement, had never met with the child, and had no bond with the child, there was evidence to support the
                        trial court’s conclusion that the child was neglected by the father. Thus, there was evidence to terminate the father’s parental rights on this statutory ground. In re C.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                        75, 781 S.E.2d 680, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C.

                        When the department took nonsecure custody of the children, all five were in the care of their grandmother, having no home, no electricity, no plumbing, and no food, and thus neglect was the same for all five children, and the availability of the boys’
                        father, while relevant to an adjudication of dependency, had no bearing on an adjudication of neglect; the trial court could not have found that some of the children were neglected while others were not, and the trial court was
                        to adjudicate the three boys, as well as the girls, neglected juveniles. In re Q.A., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 781 S.E.2d 862, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 101 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Findings were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the child was a neglected juvenile; he suffered an actual impairment due to his exposure to controlled substances, and the mother’s erratic behavior and disregard for the domestic violence
                        protection order against the father exposed the child to a substantial risk of impairment, and it was proper for a trial court to adjudicate a juvenile neglected, even if the juvenile never actually resided in the parent’s home,
                        as was the case here. In re G.T., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 791 S.E.2d 274, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1066 (2016), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 387</cite>,

                        Trial court’s findings supported its conclusion that respondents’ child was a neglected juvenile in that respondents failed to provide proper supervision for the child. Even if inflicted by the child on himself, the child’s injuries were nevertheless
                        the result of physical harm by other than accidental means that respondents allowed to occur due to their failure to maintain the child’s medication and provide adequate supervision to meet the child’s special needs. In re K.B.,

                        Trial court did not err by adjudicating a child neglected because the parents failed to remedy the conditions that required the child to be placed with her sister in a safety plan, such that they were unable to provide the child with proper care. In re
                        H.L., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 990 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Adjudication that the child was a neglected juvenile was affirmed because the prior orders entered into the record were not the sole basis for the trial court’s decision; the child presently faced substantial risk in her living environment as the mother
                        continued to fail to acknowledge her role in her rights being terminated to her six other children, she denied the need for any services for the child’s case, and she became involved with the father, who had engaged in domestic
                        violence, even though domestic violence was one of the reasons her other children were removed from her home; and the mother had not made sufficient progress in recognizing domestic violence warning signs, and in accurately assessing
                        poor decisions from the past. In re J.A.M., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 1</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 693, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 53 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Child was neglected because the child’s father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father’s ability to parent the child, and lacked
                        stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would occur in the future if the child were to be placed with the
                        father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 259 (2020).

                        Child was properly adjudicated dependent where although there was no evidence that the father had sexually abused her, the mother’s allegations rendered him unavailable to provide care or supervision at the time of the petition. In re E.P.-L.M.,

                    <p>
                        Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper on the ground of neglect because he failed to appreciably address his substance abuse issues; he had only shown an extended abstinence from cocaine use while incarcerated; he did not complete substance
                        abuse treatment; he incurred serious felony charges during the pendency of the case and was convicted of discharging a firearm into occupied property; during his incarceration, he made no attempt to contact the child and had limited
                        contact with the Department of Social Services; and he could not use his incarceration as a shield against a conclusion that there was a probability of future neglect. In re A.S.T., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 547</cite>,

                        Trial court properly adjudicated a child as neglected and dependent because its findings that the child suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of matters he witnessed while in the mother’s care and that he regressed in treatment following
                        visits with the mother were supported by clear and convincing evidence; considered with the unchallenged findings regarding drug abuse and domestic violence in the home, those findings demonstrate the environment resulted in harm
                        to the child. In re S.R.J.T., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 857 S.E.2d 345, 2021- NCCOA-94, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 122 (2021).

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that grounds existed to terminate a mother’s parental rights based on neglect because the child was removed from the mother’s care and adjudicated to be a neglected juvenile primarily due to the mother’s unstable
                        housing and history of domestic violence and the court found a likelihood of repetition of neglect if the child was returned to the mother’s care due to a lack of stable housing and unresolved domestic violence issues. In re M.A.

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s conclusion that children in the custody of a relative were neglected juveniles was appropriate because the relative’s inappropriate physical discipline of the children, refusal to follow recommendations from comprehensive clinical assessments,
                        refusal to complete parenting programs, and failure to comply with in-home services supported a finding of neglect. In re A.D. & A. (Aug. 3, 2021).

                        Trial court did not err by adjudicating the child a neglected juvenile because its findings, including the parents’ and the child’s positive drug test results, showed that the child lived in an environment injurious to his welfare. In addition, both parents
                        admitted to previous substance use, two heroin overdoses necessitating emergency medical response occurred in the home, and drug paraphernalia was present in the home. In re K.H., 2022-NCCOA-3, 867 S.E.2d 757, 2022- NCCOA-3,

                        Grounds existed to terminate the mother’s parental rights on the basis of neglect because the mother failed to take advantage of multiple opportunities to engage in services, she did not comply with the recommendations, and she did not make reasonable
                        progress in her mental health and substance abuse treatment; four of her screens were positive for marijuana, and one was positive for cocaine. In re M.S.E., 2021-NCSC-76, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 40</cite>,

                        Thus, the trial court reasonably concluded that there was a high probability that the child would be neglected in the future were he placed in the father’s care. In re W.K., 2021-NCSC-146, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 331</cite>,

                        father had been convicted of causing the infant’s death; where the mother had been advised regarding the cause of this non-accidental death but continued to support the father’s version of events; where the parents had neither
                        expressed nor exhibited any concern for the future safety of their newborn in their home; and where the father “extended most of the care for the juvenile” during the visits of the parents with the child. In re McLean,

                        The trial court’s findings of fact did not support its conclusion that a child was neglected, where the trial court’s finding that the mother did not provide the child with proper care, supervision, or discipline was more properly denominated a conclusion

                        Anonymous call, reporting a naked child two years of age, unsupervised in a driveway, did not, standing alone, constitute a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency, so the statutory investigative mandate was not properly invoked against the parents of
                        the child that refused to let a caseworker privately interview the child or the child’s siblings; the determination of neglect required the application of the legal principles set forth in G.S. 7B-101(15), and was therefore a conclusion

                        injury while in his father’s sole care, which could not have been attributed to rolling off the couch as the father contended happened when he went to get a bottle for the infant, the proof was insufficient to show that the mother

                        of fact indicated that the mother was not at the home when the child suffered his injuries; (3) the child was developing appropriately and had never missed any doctor’s appointments; (4) there were no allegations, evidence, or

                        Since the time the petition to terminate the father’s rights was filed, the father was released from incarceration, had obtained full-time employment, had family medical insurance available through the father’s employer, and had

                        lived, this fact alone did not support a conclusion that the children were neglected. The trial court also failed to make any findings of fact regarding other factors that would have supported a conclusion that the abuse would
                        have been repeated. In re J.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 757 S.E.2d 487, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 404 (2014).

                        and act out upon the children, and (4) allowed the father to drive the children after the father had consumed a large quantity of alcohol sufficiently supported a determination that the mother allowed to be created a substantial

                        who suffered injuries that were not accidental (including fractures), who had failed to thrive, and who was an abused juvenile as defined by G.S. 7B-101(a); thus, respondent mother’s argument that the termination was based solely

                        physical condition was consistent with child sexual abuse; the child’s testimony that her father raped her repeatedly over the course of a year was corroborated by the physician, who found that her vaginal trauma was consistent

                        The following findings supported the court’s conclusion that a mother’s parental rights should be terminated for neglect: (1) The child was in the bottom 5% of children in her age group in weight; (2) the mother failed to supervise her properly; (3) the
                        child was allowed to remain in dirty diapers and to drink out of discarded bottles; (4) the child lived in an environment injurious to her health and welfare; and (5) the mother suffered mental problems resulting in inability to

                        Even if there is no evidence of neglect at the time of the termination proceeding, parental rights may still be terminated if there is a showing of a past adjudication of neglect and the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence a probability

                        learned to control their aggressive tendencies, that their conduct was harmful to the children, and that termination of parental rights was in the children’s best interests. In the Matter of T.J.C.,

                        Trial court did not err by terminating a mother’s parental rights to three children on grounds of neglect because there was evidence of prior neglect, the neglect was ongoing, a substantial probability existed the children would be neglected or abused
                        in the future, and the mother continued to associate with individuals who abused her or the children. In re D.A.H.-C., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 742 S.E.2d 836, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 616 (2013).

                        District court’s findings supported the conclusion that the father’s parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father’s care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in
                        constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,

                        The trial court’s decision adjudicating a mother’s son as a neglected and dependant juvenile was not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence because the trial court’s order (1) did not distinguish between findings of fact and conclusions of
                        law, (2) did not reference any of the several statutory grounds for determining neglect, and (3) was based on an order adjudicating the son’s siblings neglected in another case, which had been remanded for adequate findings of
                        fact and conclusions of law. In re T.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 801, 606 S.E.2d 416, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 17 (2005).

                        There was ample evidence showing that the Department of Social Services used reasonable efforts towards reunification, and thus the mother’s argument that the trial court did not have the evidence it needed to find her behavior was willful or that her

                        Department of social services “alleged” that the mother’s dependency and mental illness were the cause of her child’s problems so, even without allegations of specific facts, it was error under G.S. 7B-602 for the lower court not to appoint a guardian

                        Decision that a child was dependent under G.S. 7B-101(9) was reversed because a trial court failed to conduct the two-part analysis; the court did not consider the availability of alternative child care arrangements where the evidence showed that a relative

                        Fact that the father could have been criminally liable for statutory rape pursuant to G.S. 14-27.7A(a), standing alone, was insufficient to support a conclusion that the father was unable to provide appropriate care for the child and that therefore the

                        proper care in a safe home, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(19), a trial court erred in changing custody of a child from a father to the mother because the court was required to find, but did not find, that the child would receive from
                        the mother the necessary proper care and supervision in a safe home, particularly in light of prior evidence that domestic violence had occurred in the home.

                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of the court’s prior findings

                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child’s medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        had, conducted an investigation and found that allegations of abuse and neglect by the mother’s church and the caretaker of the children were unfounded; once an official finding that no abuse and neglect had occurred, the trial

                        jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother’s parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under G.S. 7B-200(a)(4) and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired
                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)

                        Juvenile court, which acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter when the summons was served upon mother, although it was not served upon father, as required by former G.S. 7A-565, had the authority to decide the issue of neglect and dependency of

                        Failure of the director of a county department of social services to sign and verify before a notary, pursuant to G.S. 7B-403(a), a petition for a finding that a minor child was a neglected juvenile rendered the petition fatally deficient and inoperative
                        to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court; because there was no evidence in the record suggesting later filings sufficient to invoke subject matter jurisdiction as to the lower court’s subsequent order from a
                        review hearing, the trial court erred in proceeding on the matter due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.R.P., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C.

                        jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother’s parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under G.S. 7B-200(a)(4) and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired
                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)
                        the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in G.S. 7B-504 and 7B-506(a). In re T.P.,

                        In a case in which a district terminated the parental rights of a mother and a father, the mother and the father unsuccessfully argued on appeal that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to act upon a motion in the cause to reassume custody
                        by appellee, a county Department of Social Services, because the district court terminated its jurisdiction over the juvenile when it ordered the case closed. Closing a case did not mean the same thing as terminating jurisdiction,
                        and each was a separate action with distinct consequences; once jurisdiction of the court attached to a child custody matter, it existed for all time until the cause was fully and completely determined. In re S.T.P.,

                        Trial court did not err in asserting jurisdiction over a child custody action after a juvenile proceeding was terminated because the court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the father’s custody claim once he invoked jurisdiction by filing a

                        Although a trial court in a custody dispute ended the custody of a county department of social services, the court did not err in retaining jurisdiction to conduct period review hearings, despite a father’s claim that the court, under G.S. 7B-906(d) (repealed,
                        see now G.S. 7B-906.1), the court was relieved of the duty to conduct such reviews after custody was awarded to the father; in deciding a custody case under G.S. 7A-657, the almost-identical predecessor to G.S. 7B-906 (repealed,
                        see now G.S. 7B-906.1), the state’s supreme court had already ruled that the relevant statutory language meant only that a trial court had a right to terminate its jurisdiction, but a trial court was not required to do so. Further,
                        in the context of the Juvenile Code, North Carolina, G.S. 7B-201 provided that once a court obtained jurisdiction over a juvenile, that jurisdiction continued until terminated by a court order or until the juvenile reached the

                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child’s medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        Anonymous call, reporting a naked child two years of age, unsupervised in a driveway, did not, standing alone, constitute a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency, so the statutory investigative mandate was not properly invoked against the parents of

                        of the juvenile, and take appropriate steps to secure an order for nonsecure custody of the juvenile. The assessment and evaluation shall include a visit to the place where the juvenile resides, except when the report alleges abuse
                        or neglect in a child care facility as defined in Article 7 of Chapter 110 of the General Statutes. When a report alleges abuse or neglect in a child care facility as defined in Article 7 of Chapter 110 of the General Statutes,
                        a visit to the place where the juvenile resides is not required. When the report alleges abandonment, the assessment shall include a request from the director to law enforcement officials to investigate through the North Carolina
                        Center for Missing Persons and other national and State resources whether the juvenile is a missing child.

                        Domestic violence protective order entered against a father pursuant to G.S. 50B-3 was erroneous because there was no competent evidence that the father had placed a member of the mother’s family in fear of (1) imminent serious bodily injury or (2) continued
                        harassment that rose to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress; the fact that there was an investigation by the Department of Social Service was not relevant where there was no evidence presented regarding what
                        any alleged investigation revealed. The director of Department of Social Service was required to investigate any report of abuse, neglect, or dependency pursuant to G.S. 7B-302(a). Burress v. Burress,

                        The trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in a prosecution for first-degree statutory sexual offense and two counts of felonious child abuse by suppressing defendant’s incriminating statement to officers as being taken in violation of the Sixth Amendment
                        to the United States Constitution. The filing of a petition alleging abuse and neglect commences a civil proceeding, and by its terms, the Sixth Amendment applies only to criminal cases. The Supreme Court could not say, as did
                        the Court of Appeals, that the civil and criminal proceedings were so intertwined that the commencement of the civil proceeding triggered the protection involved in a criminal case. State v. Adams,

                    <p>
                        In a case involving crimes against child victim where a social worker went beyond merely fulfilling her role as the victim’s social worker and began working with the sheriff’s department on the case prior to interviewing defendant, the social worker’s
                        role changed and became essentially like that of an agent of the State; accordingly, because the social worker did not advise defendant of her Miranda rights, the trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress statements
                        made during her interview with the social worker. State v. Morrell, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 424 S.E.2d 147, <cite class="nc_code">1993 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 98, cert. denied,

                        When suspected child abuse occurs in a public school classroom, a report made in good faith by the principal of the school to his or her superior who is responsible for school personnel would clearly fall within the scope of the immunity contemplated
                        by the statute. Davis v. Durham City Schools, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 372 S.E.2d 318, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 824 (1988).

        Statutory Good Faith Presumption Shields Reporter from Slander Per Se Action. —

                    <p>
                        Summary judgment for the defendant on the issue of slander per se was appropriate where the plaintiff’s description of retaliatory motives for defendant’s report failed to rebut the statutory presumption created in favor of the defendant by the child
                        abuse reporting provisions of G.S. 7B-301 and this section which together provide immunity not merely conditional upon proof of good faith, but a “good faith” immunity which endows the reporter with the mandatory presumption that
                        he or she acted in good faith. Dobson v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 77</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 829, 2000 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2000).

                        The report referred to in this section is clearly an initial report of child abuse, as specified in former G.S. 7A-543 (see now G.S. 7B-301), which is to be made to the Director of the Department of Social Services. Coleman v. Cooper,

                        Where plaintiff alleged that defendant made false accusations of child abuse and neglect and injury and forecast evidence that the defendant knew the report to be false, a genuine issue of material fact existed — particularly as to whether the defendant
                        acted with malice and therefore lost the immunity accorded by former 7A-550 — to withstand summary judgment in a slander per se cause of action. Dobson v.

                        Under G.S. 7B-310, a trial court in a child neglect case did not err in admitting certain evidence in violation of a mother’s psychologist-patient privilege; that privilege did not operate to bar relevant evidence in an action that concerned the abuse

                        A school resource officer, who allegedly knew that a teacher was facilitating sexual liaisons between a 14-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy, was not required, nor was he permitted, to weigh the safety interests of the public when he decided not to
                        report the boy’s possible statutory rape of the girl or the teacher’s sexual exploitation of the girl and boy — rather, his duty to report abuse was imposed by statute and involved no deliberation or discretionary consideration;
                        thus, his failure to report known child abuse was outside the scope of conduct generally associated with law enforcement and the public duty doctrine did not bar the claim. Smith v. Jackson County Bd. of Educ.,

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother’s petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the
                        stepmother struck him, and thus, her name was properly added to the RIL; the child’s medical records contained numerous instances where his birthday was shown, and the stepmother did not argue that the birthdate was incorrect.

                        Trial court did not err in placing a stepmother’s name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child’s testimony tended to establish that when the stepmother struck him in the head it was intentional; because the name of an individual identified
                        as a responsible individual had to be placed on the RIL after it was determined the individual was a responsible individual, the statute required the trial court to conclude that the stepmother’s name had to be placed on the RIL.

                        Trial court had jurisdiction to hear a stepmother’s petition for judicial review of the order finding that she was a responsible individual and placing her name on the Responsible Individuals List (RIL) because the child was 17 years old at the time the

                        District court properly concluding a petitioner’s name should not be included on the Responsible Individuals List because Department of Social Services’ multi-year delay — almost four years — even well beyond the statute of limitations to prosecute for
                        a misdemeanor criminal charge, deprived the petitioner of his ability to mount a defense to preserve his protected liberty interest. In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 828 S.E.2d

                        and identified the individual as a responsible individual. The petition for judicial review shall contain the name, date of birth, and address of the individual seeking judicial review, the name of the juvenile who was the subject

                        The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without authority to enter
                        order adjudging a juvenile as neglected. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 485 S.E.2d 623, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 370 (1997).

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother’s children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in G.S. 7B-503, the court was not deprived of subject matter
                        jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother’s parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under G.S. 7B-200(a)(4) and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired
                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)
                        the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in G.S. 7B-504 and 7B-506(a). In re T.P.,

                        Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction after periodic judicial reviews were discontinued to adjudicate juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent when a director of social services (DSS) sought court action based on a new report of abuse, neglect,
                        or dependency without the prior filing of a verified petition by the DSS. Moreover, the trial court could not proceed directly to a dispositional hearing without first conducting an adjudicatory hearing and actually adjudicating
                        the juveniles as abused, neglected, or dependent. In re T.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 803 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 496 (2017).

                        Failure of the director of a county department of social services to sign and verify before a notary, pursuant to G.S. 7B-403(a), a petition for a finding that a minor child was a neglected juvenile rendered the petition fatally deficient and inoperative
                        to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. In re T.R.P., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 541, 619 S.E.2d 525, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2098 (2005),

                    <p>
                        Trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a review order in a neglect action because the juvenile petition that initiated the case was not verified as mandated by G.S. 7B-403(a); the trial court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction in the absence
                        of the verification, and thus the trial court’s order was void ab initio. In re T.R.P., <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 588</cite>, 636 S.E.2d 787, 2006 N.C. LEXIS 1193 (2006).

                        Petitions for nonsecure custody filed by DSS did not comply with G.S. 7B-403, DSS was not an agency awarded custody of the minor children by a court of competent jurisdiction, DSS did not have standing under G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3) to file the termination
                        of parental rights petitions, and the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the termination orders as: (1) the petition for adjudication with respect to child one contained a “Signature of Petitioner” as
                        the “Director of DSS by an employee” and did not contain the signature of the director under G.S. 10B-3(25); (2) DSS filed an amended petition regarding child two with no signature in the “Signature of Petitioner” space; and (3)
                        the orders awarding DSS custody were void ab initio. In re S.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 646 S.E.2d 617, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1431 (2007).

                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition filed by the caseworker even though the caseworker did not sign it and, thus, the trial court could enter its termination of parental rights order regarding the father; while the caseworker
                        did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker’s verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court
                        to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2447 (2007).

                        Failure to verify a juvenile petition as required under G.S. 7B-403 deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, and there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing between a juvenile petition and a Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of
                        International Child Abduction petition when it comes to the verification requirement; because of the mandatory nature of the remedy under the Hague Convention, which entails removing a child from a parent and returning the child
                        to another country, the interests at stake have the same magnitude and the potential consequences of any error would be just as devastating as with a juvenile petition, and the failure to verify a petition filed pursuant to the
                        Hague Convention deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over that petition. Obo v. Steven B., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 687 S.E.2d 496, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2325 (2009).

                        Juvenile petition contained a verification that appeared facially valid, as it was signed by an authorized representative of the director of the human services department, but the signature was illegible, and the space reserved for that person’s title
                        was blank; respondent had the burden of showing that the petition was not verified before a person authorized to administer oaths, and considering the presumption of regularity that attached to the trial court’s decision to exercise
                        jurisdiction, the appellate court had no basis to conclude that the petition was not properly verified. In re N.T., <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 705</cite>, 782 S.E.2d 502, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 175 (2016).

                        was effective to grant jurisdiction to the trial court. In re N.X.A., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 803 S.E.2d 244, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 640 (2017).

                        The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without authority to enter
                        order adjudging a juvenile as neglected. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 485 S.E.2d 623, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 370 (1997).

                        Juvenile petition was filed June 11, 2004, and the summons was issued four days later, but the summons was returned by the sheriff on June 30, 2004, unserved; on July 8, 2004, the mother attended a hearing regarding the allegations her minor child was
                        neglected and dependent. The mother was not only present in court, but also agreed to continue the matter until July 22, 2004, and there was no evidence that the mother raised any objection at that hearing regarding insufficient
                        service of process or personal jurisdiction; thus, her actions amounted to waiver of her right to challenge the trial court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over her regardless of whether she was served with a juvenile summons
                        in compliance with G.S. 1A-1-4. In re A.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 630 S.E.2d 33, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1220 (2006).

                        Failure to serve the children with a petition alleging abuse and neglect could not be basis for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because only a parent, guardian, or caretaker was required to be served. In re M.G., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite>                        536, 653 S.E.2d 581, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C.

                        Although a summons in a juvenile neglect proceeding was not properly signed pursuant to G.S. 7B-406 and 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(b), only personal jurisdiction, rather than subject matter jurisdiction, was implicated, and where the parents appeared in
                        the neglect proceeding and they failed to object thereto, such defense was waived; a termination of parental rights in reliance on the neglect order was valid. In re K.J.L., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 343</cite>,

                        A trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter orders in a juvenile delinquency proceeding where no summons, petition or other notice was ever served on the juvenile or her parents, guardian or custodian prior to any of the hearings. In re McAllister,

                        Failure of a record of a juvenile delinquency proceeding to show the exact time and manner of service of the summons and petition upon the juvenile and his parents was not fatal where the record affirmatively showed that the juvenile and his mother were
                        in fact accorded sufficient notice of the hearing at which he was adjudicated delinquent to provide adequate opportunity to prepare, that at least seven days prior to the hearing he had been represented by privately employed counsel,
                        and that he was represented by such counsel at the hearing, which had already been once continued. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 182 S.E.2d 662, <cite class="nc_code">1971 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1305 (1971).

                        Temporary custody means the taking of physical custody and providing personal care and supervision until a court order for nonsecure custody can be obtained. A juvenile may be taken into temporary custody without a court order by a law enforcement officer

                        Trial court had authority pursuant to G.S. 7B-200(a)(6) to issue an ex parte order directing a mother to cease interference with a department’s juvenile investigation concerning her children; however, where no request for nonsecure custody was presented
                        and no petition alleging that the children were neglected was filed, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award custody of the children to their father.

                        Proper order of custody existed prior to a trial court’s entering its adjudication and dispositional order that a mother’s son was neglected because the trial court entered an order stating that pending further hearings, the son would remain or be placed
                        in the non-secure custody of the county Department of Social Services (DSS); assuming, without deciding, that a magistrate lacked authority to enter a nonsecure custody order, the mother cited no authority suggesting that such
                        a lack of authority stripped the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over the petition filed by DSS, alleging that her son was neglected. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 679,

                        There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened

                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)

                    The custody order shall be in writing and shall direct a law enforcement officer or other authorized person to take physical custody of the juvenile and to make due return on the order. A copy of the order shall be given to the juvenile’s parent, guardian,
                    custodian, or caretaker by the official executing the order.

                <p>
                    An officer receiving an order for custody which is complete and regular on its face may execute it in accordance with its terms. If the court finds on the basis of the petition and request for nonsecure custody or the testimony of the petitioner that
                    a less intrusive remedy is not available, the court may authorize a law enforcement officer to enter private property to take physical custody of the juvenile. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize
                    a law enforcement officer to make a forcible entry at any hour. The officer is not required to inquire into the regularity or continued validity of the order and shall not incur criminal or civil liability for its due service.

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother’s children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in G.S. 7B-503, the court was not deprived of subject matter
                        jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother’s parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under G.S. 7B-200(a)(4) and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired
                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)
                        the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in G.S. 7B-504 and 7B-506(a). In re T.P.,

                        The trial court had jurisdiction to enter a temporary nonsecure custody order placing children who had been visiting noncustodial parent in North Carolina, but whose “home state” under the former UCCJA was Iowa, with DSS where there was a reasonable factual

                        When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child’s custody with the child’s foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child’s best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)c, this was error
                        because, inter alia, G.S. 7B-505 required the trial court, in entering a nonsecure custody order, to first consider the child’s placement with a relative; G.S. 7B-506(h) continued this requirement at each hearing to determine the
                        need for the child’s continued custody outside of her home, so the general assembly intended to apply this requirement to reviews of custody placements.

                        The determination of “reasonable efforts” under former G.S. 7A-577(h) is a conclusion of law because it requires the exercise of judgment; appellate review of a trial court’s conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact.

                        County department of social services (DSS) had no right to appeal the trial court’s denial of the court’s motion to review the foster care board rate provisions of a nonsecure custody order under G.S. 7B-1001(a)(1), which permitted appeal from any order
                        finding absence of jurisdiction, as the trial court never ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide DSS’s motion. Under G.S. 7B-506(d), 7B-200(a), the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to enter a nonsecure custody order;
                        and, assuming arguendo that the court erred in the scope of the court’s order for board payments to foster parents, this did not necessarily deprive the court of jurisdiction.

                        When a trial court did not completely fill out form orders granting an agency temporary nonsecure custody of a mother’s children, by failing to specify the statutory grounds for nonsecure custody in G.S. 7B-503, the court was not deprived of subject matter
                        jurisdiction to subsequently enter orders terminating the mother’s parental rights to the children because (1) the court generally had jurisdiction over this type of case, under G.S. 7B-200(a)(4) and 7B-201(a), (2) the court acquired
                        jurisdiction over the children and the mother when an agency filed petitions under G.S. 7B-401 alleging the children were neglected and dependent juveniles, as defined in G.S. 7B-101(9) and (15), pursuant to G.S. 7B-405, and (3)
                        the failure to fully complete the form orders did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction, as it was not alleged that the court did not observe the criteria for such orders in G.S. 7B-504 and 7B-506(a). In re T.P.,

                        Notwithstanding the trial court’s authority to take notice of the court’s own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court’s findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for most findings in the neglect adjudication;
                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of the court’s prior findings
                        undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 834 S.E.2d 670, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 842 (2019).

                        by an order entered pursuant to G.S. 7B-905, but required only that DSS be granted custody by a court of competent jurisdiction. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 643 S.E.2d 471,

                        Hearing on five petitions alleging abuse, neglect, and/or dependency was clearly denominated a hearing to determine the need for continued custody. The judge therefore had the discretion to either continue nonsecure custody or to return the children to
                        their home; he did not have the authority to dismiss the petitions because in so doing he made an unauthorized determination of the merits of the case. There is no express statutory authority allowing the judge to dismiss the petitions

                        When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child’s custody with the child’s foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child’s best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)c, this was error
                        because, inter alia, G.S. 7B-505 required the trial court, in entering a nonsecure custody order, to first consider the child’s placement with a relative; G.S. 7B-506(h) continued this requirement at each hearing to determine the
                        need for the child’s continued custody outside of her home, so the general assembly intended to apply this requirement to reviews of custody placements.

                        to persist if such efforts were clearly inconsistent with a juvenile’s health, safety, and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time, since ICWA shared the primary aim of the Adoption and Safe Families

                        did not prohibit ceasing reunification efforts before a proceeding to terminate parental rights, as the subsection only required a finding that “active efforts” to prevent the disruption of the Indian family “proved unsuccessful.”

                        Trial court erred in authorizing a permanent plan for a child at the disposition hearing on a dependency petition, seemingly without the required statutory notice to respondent. On remand, the trial court was required to provide the statutory notice.

                        Trial court repeatedly found that the immediate threat of harm to a child outweighed the reasonable efforts to reunify him with respondent mother. Due to the severe abuse by the mother and the mother’s reaction to the boyfriend’s abuse, the trial court
                        determined it was not in the best interests of the child to order reasonable efforts to reunify the child with respondent, as it was too dangerous to do so, and the trial court properly complied with G.S. 7B-507. In re R.B.B.,

                        In proceedings to terminate parental rights, a trial court’s permanency planning order, which implicitly ceased reunification efforts between a mother and her children, did not comply with G.S. 7B-507(b) because, while the order detailed the mother’s
                        case history and her failure to complete her case plan, the order did not contain any of the findings of fact regarding the continuation or cessation of reunification efforts as required by G.S. 7B-507(b)(1). In re A.P.W.,

                        the mother would be futile or that such efforts were inconsistent with the children’s health, safety, and need for a permanent home, and the findings listed were actually conclusions of law. In re Weiler,

                        with parents known to abuse their children; (3) the mother failed to comply with a sibling’s case plan; (4) the department of social services had offered the parents intensive case management services after the child’s birth; and

                        significant changes for the better. In re T.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 702 S.E.2d 108, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2071 (2010).

                        In a parental rights termination proceeding, a trial court, through processes of logical reasoning and based on the evidentiary facts before it, found the ultimate facts essential to support the conclusions of law that directed that reunification efforts
                        cease; the necessary findings for such cessation were sufficiently made pursuant to G.S. 7B-507(b)(1). In the Matter of T.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C.

                        There was no abuse of discretion in a trial court’s order that provided for cessation of reunification efforts between parents and their minor children pursuant to G.S. 7B-507(b)(1), as there were extensive findings regarding the father’s history of domestic
                        violence, the impact of that violence on the minor children, and the father’s lack of appreciation of the effect of such violence, even after attending the available programs. In the Matter of T.J.C.,

                        Trial court’s decision to cease reunification efforts and award guardianship of a child to the paternal grandparents was not done in error under G.S. 7B-507(b)(1) because the court’s findings established that verbal aggression and significant conflict
                        between the parents was continuing, including two significant episodes only three months before the hearing, and the parents had not successfully engaged in couples therapy. The conflict and domestic violence continued to have
                        a detrimental effect on the child’s physical and emotional well-being. In re A.Y., <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 737 S.E.2d 160, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 67 (2013).

                        Trial court’s decision to cease reunification efforts with respect to a mother’s children was supported by its findings, which were not challenged on appeal, that reunification was not in their best interest since their parents had not addressed the issue
                        of child abuse. In re J.P., 745 S.E.2d 917, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 824 (Ct. App. 2013), op. withdrawn, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 905 (N.C. Ct. App. Aug.

                        Trial court properly found further efforts to reunify a mother’s children with the mother were unwarranted because uncontested findings of fact supported the court’s conclusions that reunification efforts were inconsistent with the children’s health,
                        safety and need for a permanent home within a reasonable period of time and were not required. In re T.H., <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1158 (N.C. Ct. App. Nov. 5, 2013), op. withdrawn,

                        Trial court’s finding that a mother and her husband were not addressing the husband’s abuse of one child by remaining together although there was a no-contact order between the husband and child were linked to and supported the trial court’s conclusion
                        that reunification efforts should cease as required by G.S. 7B-507(b). In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 750 S.E.2d 543, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1209 (2013).

                        Trial court did not err in entering an order ceasing reunification because the findings in the cease reunification order standing alone suggested that reunification efforts would be futile; the order found unchallenged that the mother failed to attend
                        visits or complete her case plan, had pending criminal charges, and had not been participating in drug screens, and as such, the children would be unable to go home within six months.

                        Because the trial court properly concluded that the Department of Social Services made reasonable efforts to reunify and to eliminate the need for placement of the juvenile, it necessarily complied with the ADA’s directive that a parent not be excluded
                        from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program. The mother expressly declined mental health services and services and did not demonstrate skills needed to care for the
                        child or herself. In re A.P., 2022-NCCOA-29, 868 S.E.2d 692, 2022- NCCOA-29, <cite class="nc_code">2022 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 47 (Ct. App. 2022).

                        Trial court properly related its findings that child two could not be placed with her mother since she resided with the father and he had a no contact order with child two, that the father had pled guilty to child abuse and had violated his probation
                        and that a permanent plan of custody was in the children’s best interests to a conclusion of law that specifically set forth the basis for ceasing reunification efforts.

                        Trial court did not err in ordering that reunification efforts with the mother cease because they were inconsistent with the child’s health, safety and need for a safe, permanent home as the mother had not shown sustained parenting improvements during
                        the last two years; she had sporadic visitation attendance during the last two years; a social worker testified that the mother had been unable to consistently demonstrate skills learned in parenting classes during her interactions
                        with the child; the mother lacked awareness of or insight into her own past of domestic violence with the child’s father; despite working on anger management issues for over a year, she could not control her emotions; and she had
                        failed to maintain stable housing. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1250 (2016).

                        especially since the father’s paternity was at issue, and thus placement with the paternal grandparents as suggested by the father might not be in the best interests of the minor child since the minor child might find that they

                        because while the court held multiple proceedings pursuant to G.S. 7B-906 (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1), there was never a finding made that guardianship was the permanent plan under G.S. 7B-907 (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1);

                        Trial court properly performed its statutory duty to verify that a child’s relative and the relative’s long-term partner understood the legal significance of their appointment as guardians because the testimony of the relative, the testimony from a social
                        worker, and the home study report each provided competent evidence that both of the guardians understood the legal significance of the guardianship appointment.

                        When in a petition a juvenile is alleged to be abused or neglected, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile. When a juvenile is alleged to be dependent, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the juvenile.
                        The juvenile is a party in all actions under this Subchapter. The guardian ad litem and attorney advocate have standing to represent the juvenile in all actions under this Subchapter where they have been appointed. The appointment

                        a nonattorney is appointed as a guardian ad litem, an attorney shall be appointed in the case in order to assure protection of the juvenile’s legal rights throughout the proceeding. The duties of the guardian ad litem program shall
                        be to make an investigation to determine the facts, the needs of the juvenile, and the available resources within the family and community to meet those needs; to facilitate, when appropriate, the settlement of disputed issues;
                        to offer evidence and examine witnesses at adjudication; to explore options with the court at the dispositional hearing; to conduct follow-up investigations to insure that the orders of the court are being properly executed; to

        Appointment Of Guardian Ad Litem Program Staff Member Satisfies Requirements Of The Statute. —

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s appointment of a guardian ad litem was valid because the use of a properly appointed Guardian Ad Litem Program staff member to serve as a juvenile’s guardian ad litem fully satisfied the requirements of G.S. 7B-601; when a Guardian Ad Litem
                        Program staff member is formally appointed by the trial court to serve as an individual guardian ad litem and fulfills the duties of a guardian ad litem as required by G.S. 7B-601(a), that staff member is acting as an actual guardian
                        ad litem under the statute and cannot be considered a substitute or “de facto” guardian. In re A.N.L., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 714 S.E.2d 189, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1400 (2011).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child from the beginning of a termination proceeding; a GAL and an attorney advocate performed distinct and separate roles, so the appointment of the attorney advocate as the GAL
                        after three and a half days of testimony was insufficient, even though the advocate had been involved in the case from an earlier time. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 614 S.E.2d

                        Because five different guardian ad litems (GAL) made sporadic appearances for a mother’s children at different hearings over a three-year period, and the only GAL actually appointed by the court never appeared at any hearing, there was no GAL discharging
                        their duty to protect and promote the best interests of the children until formally relieved of the responsibility by the court as required by G.S. 7B-601(a). , rev’d <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 168</cite>,

                        Trial court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for a mother’s son because the guardian ad litem prepared a report, which reflected an investigation that complied with her duties as set forth in G.S. 7B-601(a); the report was submitted
                        to the trial court in connection with the initial adjudication hearing, the trial court’s adjudication and disposition order asserted that the guardian ad litem appeared at the hearing on the son’s behalf, and that she submitted
                        a report to the trial court relating to the son. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 679, 661 S.E.2d 313, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1099 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 254</cite>,

                        Trial court did not err in conducting a permanency planning review hearing in the absence of a guardian ad litem appointed to represent a juvenile because the juvenile’s mother neither asserted nor argued prejudice as a result of the absence of a guardian
                        ad litem at the permanency planning hearing; according to the plain language of G.S. 7B-1108 and G.S. 7B-601, the guardian ad litem’s appointment did not terminate until the permanent plan had been achieved for the juvenile and
                        approved by the court, and consequently, the guardian ad litem was required to continue to represent the juvenile at the permanency planning review hearing, but, standing alone, the failure to adhere to the requirement during a
                        permanency planning hearing did not warrant reversal and, as such, the matter was subject to harmless error review. In re H.K.L., <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 820 (N.C. Ct. App. May
                        3, 2011).

                    <p>
                        Because the mother failed to object to the lack of a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child during the termination proceedings, the issue was not preserved for appellate review; furthermore, the appellate court did not find it necessary to invoke the rule
                        suspending the Rules of Appellate Procedure to prevent manifest injustice to either the mother or the child and to review the decision not to appoint a GAL in light of the mother’s willful failure to make progress on her case plan,
                        both before and after reunification efforts were ceased, and because a GAL appointment was not statutorily required. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C.

                        As G.S. 7B-601 and G.S. 7B-1108 mandated the guardian ad litem’s (GAL) physical presence at a termination of parental rights hearing, because a GAL was not present the court presumed prejudice, as the children were not represented by a GAL at a critical
                        stage of the termination proceedings. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 695 S.E.2d 162, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1148 (2010), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 171</cite>,

                        to assist the GAL, the general assembly did not intend by the use of the word “represent” in G.S. 7B-1108(b) to obligate the volunteer GAL to appear in court during the TPR hearing unless the attorney advocate or the trial court
                        deemed the GAL’s presence necessary to protect the minor’s best interests; G.S. 7B-1108 did not impose on the GAL volunteer a special duty to “represent” a juvenile beyond what G.S. 7B-601 required of a GAL as an appointed member
                        of the GAL program. The GAL program performed the duties listed in G.S. 7B-601(a). In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 171</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 118, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 384 (2011).

                        District court jurisdiction attached on March 25, 1987, when guardian ad litem filed a motion in district court to compel Department of Social Services (DSS) to grant his requests to visit child and to obtain information on any prospective adoptive parents,
                        and subsequent notice, received on March 31, 1987, to the effect that a petition for adoption had been filed, did not end the district court’s jurisdiction.

                        In a termination of parental rights case in which a mother argued that the trial court violated her rights and committed reversible error by failing to ensure that the children had proper guardian ad litem (GAL) representation throughout every critical
                        stage of the proceeding, the 20 April 2009 order terminating the mother’s parental rights was the only order currently before the appellate court. By an order filed on 19 March 2009, an individual was appointed as the children’s
                        GAL; therefore, the children were represented by a GAL at the 19 March 2009 termination hearing, and any alleged violation of G.S. 7B-601(a), with respect to the prior termination hearings, could not be used to challenge the 17

                        Trial court erroneously failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother as required by G.S. 7B-602 where the mother had mental health issues, a depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, which resulted in the daughter’s dependency.

                        G.S. 7B-602 required that a guardian ad litem (GAL) be appointed if the juvenile was alleged to be “dependent” and the parent was incapable as a result of mental illness of providing the proper care and supervision of the juvenile; G.S. 7B-602 was not
                        limited to termination cases, and the trial court’s failure to sua sponte appoint a GAL for the mother in a dependency case was error where the trial court was on notice of the mother’s alleged mental conditions, and made references
                        to and questioned the mother’s mental condition in several orders. In re D.D.Y., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 621 S.E.2d 15, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1257 (2005).

                        Because a petition did not mention any developmental disabilities or limitations and the mother’s brief cited nothing in the record indicating that her inability to care for her children without constant assistance was due to her mental health issues,
                        the court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem. In re J.J., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 637 S.E.2d 258, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2412 (2006),

                        In a neglect and dependency proceeding, the trial court erred in not appointing a guardian ad litem pursuant to G.S. 7B-602(b)(1) for a mother because she was found to be suffering from mental illness, including depression and a borderline personality

                        Mother was not entitled to the appointment of a guardian ad litem in an action to terminate her parental rights; the mother’s sparse references to her need to counseling and drug treatment did not rise to the level of being so intertwined with the neglect
                        of her children and to be virtually inseparable and while the Department of Social Services recommended counseling, there was no significant evidence in the record to suggest that the mother’s parental rights were terminated due

                        While the presence of the minor children’s nonattorney guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteer at a termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing was preferable, the nonlawyer volunteer’s attendance was not mandatory because, given the role of the attorney advocate
                        to assist the GAL, the general assembly did not intend by the use of the word “represent” in G.S. 7B-1108(b) to obligate the volunteer GAL to appear in court during the TPR hearing unless the attorney advocate or the trial court

                        Trial court did not err by disallowing a deposition under the Rules of Civil Procedure; as the Juvenile Code provided for discovery, specifically including depositions, the Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply here. The trial court merely instructed

                        Trial court did not err by denying a mother’s motion to interview her son for whom a proceeding was initiated against the mother for termination of her parental rights because, as evidenced by the multiple findings of fact contained within multiple court
                        orders, any contact the mother had with the child was disruptive to his own therapeutic progress and it was clear from the record that the trial court was concerned with the mother’s behavior in attempting to learn of the child’s
                        whereabouts, particularly since the mother abducted the child from his school bus stop while he was in foster care. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1589 (2005).

                        Trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion by applying an administrative order governing all discovery in abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings and denying the parents’ motions to continue because the gravamen of the problem fell with the
                        inability of the attorneys to make time to review the records in accordance with the administrative order. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 641 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 494 (2007).

                        Trial court did not refuse to allow the father to depose the social worker; the trial court instructed the father to first avail himself of the information sharing provisions under the statute, while explicitly leaving open the possibility that he could
                        later file a motion for discovery requesting a deposition. As the trial court did not exercise its discretion under the statute to deny a discovery request, it could not have abused its discretion. In re M.M.,

        Improper Petition Amendment. —

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in adjudicating a child to be a neglected juvenile where the petition alleged only that the child was a dependent juvenile, the trial court had essentially amended the nature of the juvenile petition by allowing the department to proceed
                        on a claim of neglect, and as a result the mother had no notice of the claim of neglect. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 644 S.E.2d 640, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1168 (2007).

                        Trial court’s decision to allow the Department of Social Services to amend its petition to add sexual abuse allegations against a second child was erroneous because it changed the nature of the conditions relied upon in the original petition. In re M.G.,

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother’s parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)
                        would be a possible ground to support termination, and G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660

                        The North Carolina Supreme Court construed former G.S. 7A-627 (see now this section) to permit a juvenile petition to be amended only if the amended petition does not charge the juvenile with a different offense. In re Davis,

                        Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition that the caseworker filed in the termination of parental rights case regarding the father even though the caseworker did not sign the juvenile petition; the caseworker verified
                        the petition, which was sufficient to confer jurisdiction, and in any event, would have been allowed to amend the petition by signing it if not signing it was a problem.

                        Amendment to a juvenile petition alleging abuse, neglect, and dependency to add allegations of sexual abuse did not change the nature of the conditions upon which the petition was based in violation of G.S. 7B-800, because the amendment did not change

                        It has never been the practice in juvenile proceedings wholly to exclude parents, relatives or friends, or to refuse juveniles the benefit of counsel. Even so, such proceedings are usually conducted without admitting the public generally. In re Burrus,

                        his psychological evaluation and the parents’ joint motion for a continuance as: (1) the trial court continued the dispositional hearing under G.S. 7B-803 based on its need to review the father’s psychological evaluation; (2) the
                        parents requested a continuance of the case; (3) the adjudication hearing was conducted within the 60-day deadline established by G.S. 7B-801(c); (4) the dispositional order was entered less than 30 days after the dispositional
                        hearing under G.S. 7B-905(a); and (5) reunification efforts were not ceased until the dispositional hearing. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 644 S.E.2d 588, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1043 (2007).

                        Failure to hold a timely hearing as required under G.S. 7B-801 and G.S. 7B-803 was not erroneous where respondents failed to show prejudice as a result of any delay; at the adjudication and dispositional stage it was the status of the juvenile that was
                        at issue, and because parental status was not at issue, it was more difficult for respondents to show prejudice. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 643 S.E.2d 644, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 833 (2007).

                        As for delays in a child neglect case based on various continuances, most of the delay was attributed to respondent-parents’ search for an expert witness, and their request for a special trial setting, and not as they argued, due to the trial court; any
                        assignment of error based on G.S. 7B-801(c) and G.S. 7B-803 was overruled. In re T.M., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 694, 654 S.E.2d 502, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2568

                        Trial court, which continued a neglect and dependency case seven times due to a crowded docket, three times due to the absence of parties, and four times due to the absence of attorneys, did not abuse its discretion when it continued the case due to an
                        attorney’s medical needs and again due to a death in the mother’s family, as these situations might have been considered extraordinary circumstances justifying a continuance. However, a new trial was required because the court
                        abused its discretion by continuing the case the other times in a manner inconsistent with G.S. 7B-803; therefore, the court’s violations of the time limits set out in G.S. 7B-801(c) and G.S. 7B-906(a) (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1)
                        were not justified, and the mother and the fathers of her two children were prejudiced by the delays. In re R.L., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 652 S.E.2d 327, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2314 (2007).

                        Although it is proper for a court to enter a consent order in an abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding, such an order may be entered only when all parties are present, the juvenile is represented by counsel, and all other parties are either represented
                        by counsel or have waived counsel, and sufficient findings of fact are made by the court. Sherrick v. Sherrick, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C.

                        The respondent/mother’s failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by clear and convincing
                        evidence; nor was the father’s purported consent sufficient to support a finding of neglect. Thrift v. Buncombe County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 528 S.E.2d 394,

                        In the absence of the father’s presence, the mother’s consent to the adjudication of neglect as to their daughter was insufficient to dispense with the requirement of an adjudicatory hearing.

                        consent to the judgment, and testimony by a social worker did not meet the clear and convincing evidence requirement of G.S. 7B-805. In re J.R., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 592 S.E.2d

                            of abuse, neglect, or dependency, it must either adjudicate the juvenile as abused, neglected, or dependent if the allegations were proven by clear and convincing evidence or dismiss the allegation if the necessary evidentiary

                            by a county department of social services (DSS) at the hearing. As a result, the trial court’s findings of fact consisted of recitations from the facts alleged in the petitions and wholesale incorporation of reports prepared

                            or dependency without the prior filing of a verified petition by the DSS. Moreover, the trial court could not proceed directly to a dispositional hearing without first conducting an adjudicatory hearing and actually adjudicating

                            So long as proceedings in the juvenile court meet the requirements of due process, they are constitutionally sound and must be upheld. This means that: (1) The basic requirements of due process and fairness must be satisfied in a juvenile court adjudication
                            of delinquency. (2) U.S. Const., Amend. XIV applies to prohibit the use of a coerced confession of a juvenile. (3) Notice must be given in juvenile proceedings which would be deemed constitutionally adequate in a civil or criminal
                            proceeding; that is, notice must be given the juvenile and his parents sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare, and the notice must set forth the alleged misconduct
                            with particularity. (4) In juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile’s freedom is curtailed, the child and his parents must be notified of the child’s
                            right to counsel and, if unable to afford counsel, to the appointment of same. (5) Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, as a result of which the juvenile may be committed to a State institution, must be regarded as
                            “criminal” for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege applies in juvenile proceedings the same as in adult criminal cases. In re Burrus,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a mother’s third motion to continue in the proceeding commenced to terminate her parental rights to her son because, though she was incarcerated prior to the hearing, such incarceration was the result
                        of her own actions in abducting the child and the preceding continuance was allowed expressly for the purpose of allowing the mother to gather the documents that she asserted she needed to obtain. In re J.B.,

                        Because a parent did not demonstrate any extraordinary circumstances that necessitated a continuance, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in initially denying the parent’s motion to continue.

                        Given that there was no violation of a parent’s due process rights when parental rights are terminated at a hearing at which the parent was not present, respondent’s motion to continue was not based on a constitutional right, and the denial of the motion
                        was reviewed for abuse of discretion. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 614 (2017).

                        Failure to hold a timely hearing as required under G.S. 7B-801 and G.S. 7B-803 was not erroneous where respondents failed to show prejudice as a result of any delay; at the adjudication and dispositional stage it was the status of the juvenile that was
                        at issue, and because parental status was not at issue, it was more difficult for respondents to show prejudice. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 84, 643 S.E.2d 644, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 833 (2007).

                        Trial court, which continued a neglect and dependency case seven times due to a crowded docket, three times due to the absence of parties, and four times due to the absence of attorneys, did not abuse its discretion when it continued the case due to an
                        attorney’s medical needs and again due to a death in the mother’s family, as these situations might have been considered extraordinary circumstances justifying a continuance. However, a new trial was required because the court
                        abused its discretion by continuing the case the other times in a manner inconsistent with G.S. 7B-803; therefore, the court’s violations of the time limits set out in G.S. 7B-801(c) and G.S. 7B-906(a) (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1)

                        his psychological evaluation and the parents’ joint motion for a continuance as: (1) the trial court continued the dispositional hearing under G.S. 7B-803 based on its need to review the father’s psychological evaluation; (2) the

                        The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence, G.S. 8C-1, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court
                        could properly consider written psychological reports in determining, on motion brought by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of children would be best served by modification
                        of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 336 S.E.2d 136, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4394 (1985) (decided prior

                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of the court’s prior findings

                        In a juvenile adjudicatory hearing, the respondent is entitled to have the evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. The State, therefore, must present substantial evidence of each essential element of the
                        offense charged and of respondent’s being the perpetrator. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2633 (1986).

                        Court reversed a trial court’s order adjudicating a mother’s children as neglected, because the county department of social services did not present any evidence by which the trial court could have made any findings of fact or conclusions of law as required
                        by G.S. 7B-807, and nevertheless, the trial court entered certain findings of fact, one of which recited verbatim the summary of the department’s intervention, which report had not been introduced into evidence. In re A.W.,

                        While the findings of fact and conclusions of law showed, by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to G.S. 7B-805, that a father neglected his three-month-old infant under G.S. 7B-101(15), based on an incident where the infant suffered a severe head
                        injury while in his father’s sole care, which could not have been attributed to rolling off the couch as the father contended happened when he went to get a bottle for the infant, the proof was insufficient to show that the mother
                        had neglected the infant; she was not at home when the incident occurred and there were no other incidents involving the infant. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 617 S.E.2d 325,

                        Disagreement among expert physicians as to whether a six-month-old child’s broken clavicle, compression fracture of the spine, and hemorrhaged eyes were caused by accidents or by non-accidental trauma, as well as a trial court’s findings that the child’s
                        regular pediatrician saw no reason for concern about child abuse and that there was no evidence that her parents had problems affecting their parenting ability, supported the trial court’s conclusion of law that clear and convincing
                        evidence was not presented to show that the child was abused or neglected under G.S. 7B-805. In re A.R.H., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 797, 629 S.E.2d 925, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1183 (2006).

                        Finding of child abuse under G.S. 7B-101(1) was improper because the only evidence of record was a spanking by the father with a belt, resulting in a bruise on the child’s buttocks, which did not rise to the level of “serious injury” to constitute abuse

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that the minor child was a neglected juvenile, as the allegation in the petition that the minor child was neglected because the minor child lived in an environment injurious to the minor child’s welfare was proven
                        by clear and convincing evidence; indeed, the evidence showed that the minor child’s older sibling was adjudicated abused and neglected because the mother’s boyfriend, who was cohabitating with the mother at the time of the abuse,
                        pled guilty to several felony sex offenses. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 375 (2007).

                        Trial court erred in adjudicating a child as dependent and placing her in the custody of the a social service agency because, while the trial court acknowledged that the father’s paternity had been established, it made no findings and the agency made
                        no allegations and presented no evidence that the father, although a minor, was unable to provide or arrange for the care and supervision of the child.

                        Dismissal of a summary ejectment action was error because a trial court held the landlord to a clear, cogent, and convincing evidence standard, and in a summary ejectment action, the landlord’s burden of persuasion was by the preponderance of the evidence
                        as set forth in G.S. 42-30; this standard also applied to appeals of summary ejectment actions in the district court. Durham Hosiery Mill Ltd. P'ship v.

                        A trial court’s failure to state the standard of proof used in making a determination of abuse or neglect constitutes error. However, because no appeal was taken or other relief sought from trial court’s failure to state the standard of proof used in

                        The trial court did not err by concluding that petitioner was authorized to file petition to terminate parental rights, nor by ruling that the parties were estopped from relitigating abuse and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent
                        was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent
                        the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused his children.

                        Trial court did not err in consolidating the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings for evidentiary purposes in the mother’s case alleging abuse and neglect against her child, as there was no requirement that those two stages be conducted at separate
                        hearings and the trial court still applied the proper, separate evidentiary standards, namely “clear and convincing evidence” for the adjudicatory stage and the “best interests of the child” standard for the disposition stage.

                        Notwithstanding the trial court’s authority to take notice of the courts own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court’s findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for most findings in the neglect adjudication;
                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of its prior findings undermined
                        the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 834 S.E.2d 670, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 842 (2019).

                        The respondent/mother’s failure to be present at the adjudicatory hearing did not relieve the trial court of its duty to find, based on competent evidence, that the allegations of neglect contained in the petition were supported by clear and convincing

                        Trial court erred in entering a consent judgment finding that a mother had neglected her children; pursuant to G.S. 7B-902, consent by the father of a child was insufficient to bind the mother when the mother was not present at the hearing and did not
                        consent to the judgment, and testimony by a social worker did not meet the clear and convincing evidence requirement of G.S. 7B-805. In re J.R., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 592 S.E.2d

                        with the injuries observed, the injuries occurred while the child was in the physical custody of the mother, the injuries were severe, and the mother failed to obtain medical attention for the child. In re T.H.T.,

                        In a case alleging abuse, neglect, and dependency, a medical expert explained that with an infarction, part of the brain tissue begins to swell, will become damaged, and will either scar down or just go away; the damaged portion of the brain typically
                        will not regenerate. Thus, based on the expert’s testimony, the trial court’s finding of fact that the areas effected by the infarctions will not regenerate was supported by clear and convincing evidence. In re J.A.G.,

                        Evidence supported a finding of neglect under former G.S. 7A-635 where the trial court found that respondent parents intended to live with their new infant in the home of the maternal grandparents where their previous child died; where the child’s father
                        had been convicted of causing the infant’s death; where the mother had been advised regarding the cause of this non-accidental death but continued to support the father’s version of events; where the parents had neither expressed
                        nor exhibited any concern for the future safety of their newborn in their home; and where the father “extended most of the care for the juvenile” during the visits of the parents with the child. In re McLean,

                        In a case alleging abuse, neglect, and dependency, the finding that the mother had neglected in the past to appropriately care for the child was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, because: (1) although the mother testified that she neither
                        placed any devices on the sofa to prevent the child from falling off nor placed any pillows in front of the sofa in the event that the child did roll off, the child was unable to roll over, and was not otherwise mobile, during
                        the prior instances when the parents placed him on the sofa; (2) it was not unusual for parents to place an immobile infant on a sofa, couch, or bed; and (3) the child had never missed any doctor’s appointments, was developing
                        appropriately, and had no prior injuries. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1091 (N.C. Ct. App. June 7, 2005), op. withdrawn, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        Fact that the father could have been criminally liable for statutory rape pursuant to G.S. 14-27.7A(a), standing alone, was insufficient to support a conclusion that the father was unable to provide appropriate care for the child, and thus that the child

                        the trial court’s extensive findings indicated a careful evaluation of all of the evidence, the appellate court’s review of the record, without the benefit of a narration of the missing evidence, failed to show any prejudice to

                        Although G.S. 7B-1109 does not specifically require the trial court to affirmatively state in its order terminating parental rights that the allegations of the petition were proved by clear and convincing evidence, this section does require such a statement,
                        and without such an affirmative statement the appellate court is unable to determine if the proper standard of proof was utilized for its ruling on parental termination.

                        Nothing in G.S. 7B-807(a) allowed the trial court to hold a ruling on an allegation in a petition alleging abuse, neglect, or dependency in abeyance, as the trial court attempted to do in this instance; when a trial court was required to adjudicate allegations
                        of abuse, neglect, or dependency, it must either adjudicate the juvenile as abused, neglected, or dependent if the allegations were proven by clear and convincing evidence or dismiss the allegation if the necessary evidentiary

                        Trial court’s finding of abuse and neglect were based on clear and convincing evidence where three physicians, two of whom were experts in the area of child abuse, testified that the juvenile was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of child
                        abuse with a substantial risk of morbidity and even mortality, possibly induced by the mother either smothering the juvenile or administering a toxin.

                        In a case where there was an adjudication of dependency, neglect, and abuse, any error in the admission of the child’s hearsay statements was harmless because the other evidence alone supported a finding of dependency and neglect. The evidence at trial
                        clearly showed (1) the mother violated a safety plan by leaving the child alone with men who were alleged to be sexually abusing her; (2) an examining doctor found extensive eroding dental caries going into the gums and a one-inch
                        linear scar on the child’s lower leg that was opined to be inflicted by the mother with either a shoe, a stick with thorns, or the metal part of a belt; (3) the mother called the child a “whore” and a “bitch” and further stated
                        that the child was no longer her daughter and that she was on her own and no longer had a mother; and (4) expert testimony that the child displayed symptoms of anxiety, anger, disassociation, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

                        Trial court’s detailed findings of fact, including that the doctors noted in medical records that the infant was a healthy, well-cared-for, three-month-old baby and that respondents were at all times forthcoming and cooperative in the investigation and
                        did not delay in seeking medical attention, did not support the conclusion that respondents inflicted or allowed the infliction of the infant’s injuries. That respondents could not explain the injury did not necessitate a finding

                        Trial court improperly incorporated the allegations from the juvenile petition as its findings of fact under G.S. 7B-807(b) in its adjudication of the child’s neglect or dependency due to the mother’s absence from home. The trial court also erred in failing
                        to address visitation as required by G.S. 7B-905(c). In the Matter of S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 718 S.E.2d 709, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2350 (2011).

                        Trial court met the requirements of this section by stating the standard used at the adjudication stage of the proceeding; he was not also required to recite that his decision at the disposition stage of the proceeding was discretionary. Clark v. Williamson,

                        In appeals from adjudicatory and dispositional orders in which the alleged error is the trial court’s failure to adhere to statutory deadlines set forth in G.S. 7B-807(b) and 7B-905(a), such error arises subsequent to the hearing and therefore does not
                        affect the integrity of the hearing itself; thus, a new hearing serves no legitimate purpose, does not remedy the error, and only exacerbates the error and causes further delay. Instead, a party seeking recourse for such error
                        should petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 22(a). In re T.H.T., <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 446</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 54, 2008 N.C. LEXIS 686 (2008).

                        could not have been remedied by a new hearing. The proper remedy would have been to seek a writ of mandamus pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 22(a) to compel the trial court to enter the order. In re T.H.T.,

                        such a continuance. This is particularly so in light of the provision of former G.S. 7A-632 (see now G.S. 7B-803 and 7B-2406) that “The judge may continue at any time any case to allow additional factual evidence, social information

                <p>
                    The purpose of dispositions in juvenile actions is to design an appropriate plan to meet the needs of the juvenile and to achieve the objectives of the State in exercising jurisdiction. If possible, the initial approach should involve working with the
                    juvenile and the juvenile’s family in their own home so that the appropriate community resources may be involved in care, supervision, and treatment according to the needs of the juvenile. Thus, the court should arrange for appropriate
                    community-level services to be provided to the juvenile and the juvenile’s family in order to strengthen the home situation.

                        Trial court did not err in consolidating the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings for evidentiary purposes in the mother’s case alleging abuse and neglect against her child, as there was no requirement that those two stages be conducted at separate

                        Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject to the discretionary powers of

                        Trial court could be presumed to have disregarded the incompetent evidence because the trial court made no findings pertaining to hearsay evidence in support of its adjudication of neglect and dismissed the sexual abuse allegation, and the trial court
                        was authorized to consider the hearsay evidence and other evidence to show propensity in its dispositional order. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C.

                        Despite an appellate court’s determination that several of the trial court’s findings of fact were not supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in a neglect and abuse case, it also found that several findings of fact were so supported and provided
                        sufficient evidence to uphold the neglect and abuse adjudication of a mother’s infant child based on the mother’s (1) whereabouts to have been unknown upon the baby’s discharge from the hospital, (2) testing positive for marijuana
                        since the adjudication hearing, (3) refusal to attend several substance abuse assessments, (4) failure to make progress on her psychological problems, and (5) abuse and neglect adjudication regarding an older daughter; the trial
                        court did not err by admitting the evidence of the DSS and guardian ad litem’s reports, because the formal rules of evidence did not apply to dispositional hearings.

                        In an adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning order concluding that the son was an abused juvenile, the trial court erred in relieving the county department of social services from making further reunification efforts following the initial

                        beyond the retired judge’s oral recitations, and because rendering and entering judgment was more than a ministerial task, the chief district court judge had no authority to sign the adjudication and disposition orders, which were

                        The medical evaluation of juveniles is of critical importance in proceedings involving allegations of abuse and neglect under the Juvenile Code. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 384 S.E.2d 558,

                        The provision in subsection (6) of former G.S. 7A-286 that a juvenile judge may not commit a child directly to a mental institution was clearly designed to prevent conflicts with various statutes under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite>.

                        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutional defense, procedural, and evidentiary rules. To allow juvenile judges to commit minors to

                        as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2019 (1976).

                        The determination of “best interest” under former G.S. 7A-647(2)c. is a conclusion because it requires the exercise of judgment; appellate review of a trial court’s conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported by findings of fact. In re
                        Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1061 (1997).

                        There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened

                        Under former G.S. 7A-647, once a minor is adjudicated neglected, a judge has the authority to place the child in the custody of the Department of Social Services. In re Devone, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 356

                        Trial court did not err in placing the minor child in the custody of the county social services department despite the father’s contention that the minor child could have been placed with relatives; no showing was made that suitable relatives existed,
                        especially since the father’s paternity was at issue, and thus placement with the paternal grandparents as suggested by the father might not be in the best interests of the minor child since the minor child might find that they
                        were not the minor child’s relatives after all. In re D.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 641 S.E.2d 18, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 375 (2007).

                        Trial court did not err in finding that returning children to their parents’ custody would be contrary to their health, safety and welfare. because the trial court’s findings of fact clearly established the children lived in an environment that was injurious

                        When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child’s custody with the child’s foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child’s best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)c, this was error
                        as: (1) this statutory requirement applied to the review hearing at which the trial court entered its custody order because G.S. 7B-906 (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1), which governed the hearing, incorporated dispositional alternatives
                        in G.S. 7B-903, which gave priority to placing a child with a suitable relative; (2) 42 U.S.C.S. § 671(a)(19) required that, as a condition for receiving federal foster care funds, a state had to have a foster care plan that gave
                        preference to placement with a relative; (3) G.S. 7B-505 required the trial court, in entering a nonsecure custody order, to first consider the child’s placement with a relative, and G.S. 7B-506(h) continued this requirement at
                        each hearing to determine the need for the child’s continued custody outside of her home, so the general assembly intended to apply this requirement to reviews of custody placements; and (4) exempting review hearings from the requirement
                        to first consider placement with relatives risked undermining the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), G.S. 7B-3800, as home studies of out-of-state relatives required by the ICPC were often not completed until

                        Trial court erred in granting guardianship of a father’s child to a non-relative because the father had standing to raise the issue on appeal inasmuch as the paternal grandmother was never a party in the juvenile case, the father was asserting his own
                        interest to have the court consider a potentially viable relative placement for the child before granting guardianship to a non-relative, the question of whether the grandmother should have been given priority placement consideration
                        over a non-relative had never been addressed by the court, the trial court specifically found that both parents opposed appointing a non-relative guardian for the child and wished for the child to be placed with her grandmother

                        court was not authorized to award custody of the children to their aunt and uncle in Arizona; the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children required that Arizona notify DHS the proposed placement of the children did not appear

                        that loaded weapons were kept in their home, yet in the contempt proceeding, the trial court made no findings addressing a prior adjudication in which it had been determined that the child was neglected, and no findings were made
                        as to whether efforts to mend the mother’s relationship with her husband had been resolved. In re H.S.F., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 628 S.E.2d 416, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 866 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred by placing children in the custody of the county department of social services because its dispositional order failed to contain a finding required for the adoption of one of the dispositional alternatives outlined in G.S. 7B-903(a)(2);
                        G.S. 7B-903(a) requires that a finding that the juvenile needs more adequate care or supervision or needs placement be made as a precondition for the adoption of one of the dispositional alternatives outlined in G.S. 7B-903(a)(2).

                    The trial court did not have authority, pursuant to this section, to order respondent to “secure and maintain safe, stable housing and employment” nor to contact a child support enforcement department. This section is the trial court’s only source of
                    authority over the parent of a juvenile adjudicated abused or neglected, and the trial court may not order a parent to undergo any course of conduct not provided for in the statute.

                    Pursuant to G.S. 7B-904(d1)(3), a trial court did not exceed its authority in ordering the mother to comply with its directive that the father not have any contact with the son, as the infant had suffered a severe head trauma while in the father’s sole
                    care, which could not have been attributed to the infant’s having rolled off the couch, as the father claimed. In re J.A.G., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 617 S.E.2d 325, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                    LEXIS 1785 (2005).

                    Trial court erred in ordering a father to contact the Child Support Enforcement Agency and to pay child support for the benefit of the children as G.S. 7B-904(d) did not provide the trial court with authority to order the father to contact a child support
                    enforcement authority. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 706, 640 S.E.2d 817, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 378, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 686</cite>, 651 S.E.2d

                    Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction under G.S. 7B-200(a) over neglect proceedings, and as G.S. 7B-903 authorized the placement of the neglected child with the child’s mother, the trial court had authority under G.S. 7B-904 to order a father to
                    pay child support to the child’s mother; however, further findings were required under G.S. 7B-904(d) and G.S. 50-13.4(c) as to the reasonable needs of the child and the relative ability of the father to provide that amount. In re

                    Trial court erred in ordering a father to obtain and maintain stable employment under G.S. 7B-904 as nothing suggested that the father’s employment situation, or lack thereof, led to or contributed to the juvenile’s adjudication as a neglected child.

                    In a case in which the district court properly determined that the younger child was abused and that both children were neglected, the district court lacked the authority to order the mother to maintain stable housing and employment because nothing in
                    the district court’s findings of fact suggested that the mother’s lack of employment or unstable housing contributed to the children’s removal from her custody as the primary factors which led to the removal of the children in November
                    2013 were the mother’s inability to provide proper care and discipline for the children, in that she abused the younger child and neglected both children. In re H.H., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 431,

                    Court’s dispositional order requiring a child’s father to maintain steady employment and obtain a domestic violence assessment and follow the assessment’s recommendations did not exceed the court’s authority because there was a nexus between the order’s

                <p>
                    The determination of reunification requirements is a conclusion of law because it requires the application of legal principles pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(b2); appellate review of a trial court’s conclusions of law is limited to whether they are supported
                    by findings of fact. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 505, 491 S.E.2d 672, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1061 (1997).

                    Support payments ordered pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(c) should be based on the interplay of the trial court’s conclusions as to the amount of support necessary to meet the needs of the child and the ability of the parents to provide that amount. The
                    court’s conclusions should in turn be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to show that the court gave due regard to the relevant factors in G.S. 50-13.4(c) and any other relevant factors of the particular case. When such
                    findings are not made, the order should be vacated, because appellate courts have no means of determining whether the order is supported by the evidence and is based on the proper considerations. In re Botsford,

                    Conditions imposed on the parents of the neglected children who were removed due to domestic violence were reasonably related to aiding the parents in remedying the conditions which led to the children’s removal where the parents were required to comply
                    with the recommendations of mental health professional, medical professionals supplying prescription medications, substance abuse evaluations, drug screens and the child medical evaluation, and provide copies of deeds or leases, and
                    employment or income records. In re A.R., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 742 S.E.2d 629, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 608 (2013).

                    Trial court did not err by ordering the mother to show proof of income because it was reasonably related to ensure that the children had adequate care and supervision as the condition that led to their adjudication was lack of care and supervision. In

                    Trial court did not err by ordering the mother to refrain from allowing mental health to impact her parenting because it bore relationship to her children’s removal from her home, as the trial court found that the mother had conspired with the father
                    and the paternal grandmother to develop a completely false narrative about the child’s injuries and the mother promulgated a false narrative about her toddler child being at fault for for the older child’s burns. In re W.C.T., 2021-NCCOA-559,

                        Because a father did not object when the department of social services informed the trial court that the hearing was noticed on for both permanency planning and disposition, and it wanted to proceed with both, he has waived appellate review of the propriety
                        of the combined hearing; the father received multiple notices in the weeks and months before the hearing that the trial court would be conducting a combined adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning hearing. In re H.L.,

                        Trial court erred in failing to provide for visitation between the mother and the mother’s older two children who were placed with the father due to the mother’s neglect; the trial court was required by statute to provide for appropriate visitation as
                        would be in the best interests of the minor children, consistent with their health and safety, and the trial court’s failure to so provide meant the trial court had to consider the issue of visitation upon remand of the case to
                        it. In re C.P., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 698, 641 S.E.2d 13, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 377 (2007).

                        When a son was found to be abused and the son and a daughter were found to be neglected, a trial court’s dispositional order did not comply with G.S. 7B-905(c) because the order neither provided for visitation between the children and the children’s parents
                        nor found that such visitation was not in the children’s best interests. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 678 S.E.2d 794, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1075

                        In a child neglect hearing in which the trial court did not include a visitation plan by the mother, as required by G.S. 7B-905(c), the mother could not be heard to complain on appeal since the trial court gave the mother exactly what she wanted. It was
                        clear from the trial court’s unchallenged findings of fact that the mother had declined to engage in visitation with the two children, had expressly stated that she did not want to see them, and was generally unwilling to do anything
                        to promote reunification between herself and the children; the mother could have hardly made her lack of interest in visiting with the children clearer.

                        to address visitation as required by G.S. 7B-905(c). In the Matter of S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 718 S.E.2d 709, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2350 (2011).

                        Visitation order, giving the mother two hour long visits, complied with the statutory mandate in this section. In re J.W., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 772 S.E.2d 249, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 375 (2015).

                        Trial court’s order for supervised visitation as to the mother was not manifestly unsupported by reason, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting her to a minimum of one hour per week of supervised visitation with the child, because
                        the trial court had heard testimony that the parent’s unsupervised visitation had previously been rescinded due to separate instances of visitation where they appeared to be under the influence, the child’s guardian ad litem recommended
                        supervised visitation, and the child’s therapist’s letter also described concerns with changing the juvenile’s routine. In re I.K., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C.

                        Father’s argument that the trial court failed to provide him with notice of his right to file a motion with the trial court to review the visitation plan was rejected because in open court the trial court made the parties aware in a general sense that

                        Trial court’s order providing for a father’s supervised visitation with his child every other week, to be reduced to once a month if he acted inappropriately, required additional findings and conclusions as to the time, place, and conditions of an appropriate
                        visitation plan. In re J.P., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 750 S.E.2d 543, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1209 (2013).

                        Trial court’s visitation plan was insufficient because the court did not establish the duration of a mother’s monthly visitation. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C.

                        specify whether the visits with the mother would be supervised or unsupervised. In re J.D.M.-J., <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 817 S.E.2d 755, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 604 (2018).

                        Trial court properly accounted for the minimum frequency and length of visitation and provided for the visitations to be supervised by the family therapist; nothing required the court to designate a time and place for the visitations. In re N.B.,

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s visitation provisions were not inconsistent because the trial court’s conclusion that the mother was a parent whose status conveyed a right to visitation was subject to the determination of the scope and duration of visitation as would be
                        in the best interest of the child consistent with his health and safety; the trial court’s determination that the foster parents be appointed the child’s guardians conveyed the parental status the mother retained following that
                        determination. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 826 S.E.2d 258, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 226 (2019).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying visitation because visitation with the mother was not in the child’s best interest consistent with his health and safety; the trial court’s ultimate finding that visitation would be inappropriate and
                        not in the child’s best interest was supported by the trial court’s evidentiary findings. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 826 S.E.2d 258, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 226 (2019).

                        Trial court did not err by limiting the mother’s visitation with her children to one-hour of highly supervised weekly visits because the parents failed to provide the name of an appropriate alternative placement before the temporary placement ended, the
                        children were placed with a foster family one-and-a-half hour drive the parents’ home, and the order allowed the foster parents and the parents to agree to additional visitation time. In re W.C.T., 2021-NCCOA-559, 867 S.E.2d 14,

                        Trial court impermissibly delegated its judicial function to a father because the disposition order delegated to the father substantial discretion over kinds of visitation, such as the mother having lunch with the child at school; the order also provided

                        made no reference to visitation and made no findings supporting the conclusion, and (2) a finding adopting reports of the Department of Social Services and the guardian ad litem as findings of fact was insufficient. In re J.R.S.,

                        Trial court improperly gave the father substantial discretion over the circumstances of the mother’s visitation by allowing him to choose the location and supervisor of the visitation, even though the father testified he was not willing to facilitate

                        Mother’s appellate claim that a trial court erred in ordering supervised visitation without addressing cost, who would bear the expense, or the mother’s ability to pay that expense was considered on appeal despite her failure to object because no objection

                            of the combined hearing; the father received multiple notices in the weeks and months before the hearing that the trial court would be conducting a combined adjudication, disposition, and permanency planning hearing. In re

                            ability to support the child was not sufficient evidence of such ability. In re P.A., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 772 S.E.2d 240, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                            Trial court’s findings when establishing a guardianship for a mother’s child did not violate G.S. 7B-906.1(e)(2) because (1) no authority required the court to find every right the mother might possibly retain, and, (2) when the court specified no right
                            the mother retained other than supervised visitation, she retained none. In re M.B., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 800 S.E.2d 757, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                            Remand for further proceedings was necessary because a district court erred by requiring a parent to pay for supervised visits without making necessary findings, waiving further review hearings without making all necessary findings of fact, awarding legal

                            District court erred in entering a permanency planning review order and an order appointing a guardian for a child because the court did not hold a proper hearing inasmuch as it failed to make the required findings of fact, did not first determine that
                            the father was unfit, acted inconsistently with his constitutionally protected parental status, or was otherwise unfit to serve as a parent to the child, and the father was not afforded the opportunity to raise an objection
                            on constitutional grounds at the permanency planning review hearing. In re R.P., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 798 S.E.2d 428, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                            would be in the best interests of the minor children, consistent with their health and safety, and the trial court’s failure to so provide meant the trial court had to consider the issue of visitation upon remand of the case

                            Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject to the discretionary powers of

                            In order to have custody restored, former G.S. 7A-657 requires the mother to show only that child will receive proper care and supervision and that such placement is deemed to be in the best interest of the child. Consequently, evidence of the mother’s
                            own changed circumstances and evidence that the child’s welfare is being adversely affected by the child’s present environment are both factors in the equation. In re Shue, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 586</cite>,

                            Because the trial court was statutorily required to hear testimony from the foster parents and any person who would aid in its review, its decision to permit the foster parents and their counsel to participate in the permanency planning proceedings was

                            see now G.S. 7B-906.1), the court was relieved of the duty to conduct such reviews after custody was awarded to the father; in deciding a custody case under G.S. 7A-657, the almost-identical predecessor to G.S. 7B-906, the

                            planning hearing, subsequent permanency planning hearings were to be held at least every six months thereafter, and that the hearings could be combined with review hearings under G.S. 7B-906 (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1);
                            while the hearings could be dispensed with under certain circumstances, the trial court failed to find all the criteria under former G.S. 7B-906(b) before doing so.

                            Trial court’s order which changed a mother’s permanency planning order from reunification efforts with her two minor children to termination of her parental rights was based on findings of fact which were deemed insufficient to support the conclusions
                            of law, and accordingly, there was no compliance with the requirement of G.S. 7B-507(b), and the order was reversed; the trial court failed to make specific factual findings that efforts towards reunification with the mother
                            would be futile or that such efforts were inconsistent with the children’s health, safety, and need for a permanent home, and the findings listed were actually conclusions of law. In re Weiler,

                            Even though the trial court did not specifically identify the various statutory factors it considered in authorizing a change in permanency planning from reunification to adoption, it was clear from the record that all of them had been taken into account;
                            moreover, since there was competent evidence in the record to support the conclusion that adoption was in the best interest of the children (where one child had become pregnant while staying in the parental home and the other
                            expressed a longing to be adopted by the foster parents), the appeals court would not disturb the order. In re J.C.S., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 595 S.E.2d 155, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 746 (2004).

                            to the children’s adoption, there was not finding as to whether adoption should be pursued as required by former G.S. 7B-907(b)(3); (3) there was no finding as to whether the children should remain in the current placement
                            or be placed in another permanent living arrangement and why as required by former G.S. 7B-907(b)(4); and (4) the only report specifically discussing the children submitted for the permanency planning hearing was the guardian
                            ad litem’s report, and it was not incorporated in the findings of fact. In re Z.J.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 645 S.E.2d 206, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 1161 (2007).

                            therapy sessions, failed to safe secure housing and income, and had unprotected sex resulting in numerous unplanned pregnancies that strained the mother’s already limited resources, including the time and money she could devote
                            to caring for the child. In re K.S, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 315, 646 S.E.2d 541, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1164 (2007).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not fail to make sufficient findings of fact under G.S. 7B-907(b) (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1) because it considered the stability of a minor child’s home life, her ability to interact with her siblings and mother, and her desire
                            to remain in her current living situation with the aunt and uncle; the findings sufficiently supported and explained the basis for the trial court’s determination that placement with the father within the next six months would
                            not be in the child’s best interest, and the child had to be placed in another permanent living arrangement. In re B.G., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C.

                            Although there was sufficient evidence in the record to support proper findings regarding a trial court’s decision to cease reunification efforts between a mother and child, the actual findings made by the trial court were insufficient because the trial
                            court entered one order that pertained to two parents in very different situations, it did not clearly delineate which findings applied to each parent, and while the record showed that the trial court meant to cease reunification

                            to G.S. 7B-1001, could have appealed from either the review hearing ceasing efforts to reunify the family or from the permanency planning order that changed the permanency plan to termination of parental rights. In re C.L.C.,

                            Appellate court dismissed a mother’s appeal from the trial court’s order which found that her child was neglected and set adoption as the permanent plan for the child because the appeal became moot when the trial court entered a subsequent order terminating

                            Allowing the mother to stay the termination proceedings pending an appeal of a custody review order would have precluded compliance with the termination timeline mandated under G.S. 7B-907, G.S. 7B-1109, and G.S. 7B-1110, and this would have been improper.

                            did not assign as error the trial court’s findings of fact; therefore, the findings were deemed to be supported by competent evidence and were conclusive on review.

                            entered on March 12, 2008 and the trial court’s additional findings of fact supported a conclusion that placement with the grandmother was not in the children’s best interests. In re E.K.,

                        Statute clearly contemplates the use of multiple, concurrent plans including reunification and adoption, and during concurrent planning, the Department of Social Services is required to continue making reasonable reunification efforts until reunification
                        is eliminated as a permanent plan; under the framework of concurrent planning, the prior order here did not explicitly or implicitly eliminate reunification as a permanent plan, and thus the order failed to meet the requirements

                        Because the hearing was designated as a permanency planning hearing, mother was on notice that the trial court could change the permanent plan for the juveniles and that she needed to present all evidence relevant to her arguments concerning proper disposition;
                        although mother argued that notice of a change in recommendations be given in advance of the hearing, such notice is not required by the chapter and mother’s due process rights were not violated. In re H.A.J.,

                    <p>
                        Order contained no findings under G.S. 7B-901(c) as that subsection did not apply since the child was not placed in department of social services custody; thus, when establishing permanent plans, the trial court was required to make reunification a primary
                        or secondary plan and require reunification efforts unless it found they would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with the child’s health or safety, and it could make that finding even though it was the first hearing. In re H.L.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 807 S.E.2d 685, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 990 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s findings of fact were not sufficient to support the court’s conclusion that reunification efforts should have ceased since the evidence contained in the agency and guardian ad litem reports, while indicating concern with the parents’ extensive
                        substance abuse history and the sustainability of recent improvements, did not support the finding, and the findings provided little indication as to what clear and convincing evidence the court found persuasive in reaching the
                        court’s conclusion. In re I.K., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 818 S.E.2d 359 (2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Findings that efforts to reunify a mother and child should cease were sufficient because (1) the findings were not contradictory, (2) the mother acted in a manner inconsistent with the child’s health or safety, and (3) the findings addressed the substance
                        of G.S. 7B-906.2(b). In re M.T.-L.Y., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 829 S.E.2d 496, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 475, writ denied, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 709</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Termination of parental rights and permanency plan orders were vacated because the orders did not comply with recent precedent requiring that an initial permanency plan order contain a plan for reunification. In re M.T.-L.Y.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 829 S.E.2d 496, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 475, writ denied, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 709</cite>, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 1269 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Ceasing reunification efforts was not error where an assigned social worker’s testimony that the mother attempted but had not been able to show that she could obtain and maintain information or parent the children in a safe environment supported the findings,
                        notwithstanding any evidence to the contrary. Even though a finding that the county social services department did not have a release for the mother’s mental health records was erroneous, it did not impact the ultimate determination.

                        Even if the trial court had not used the precise language of G.S. 7B-906.2(b), that was not fatal as the trial court’s findings addressed the health, safety, and welfare of the children. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. App.</cite>                        427, 848 S.E.2d 749, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 665 (2020).

                        No evidence showed mother abusing medications, having mental health breakdowns, or being involved in unhealthy relationships for three years after child was removed from her care, her limited communications and visits with the child were described as
                        appropriate, and she maintained stable employment and housing; finding reunification efforts would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with child’s health was unsupported by clear evidence and did not meet the mandatory requirements
                        of the statute. In re J.C.-B., 856 S.E.2d 883 (Mar. 16, 2021).

                        Nothing indicates concrete action steps or that timelines were established from contacts, reviews, and assessments to reunify child with mother, department made no diligent or substantial efforts towards reunification in the more than 10 months between
                        court’s decision in March 2019 and the hearing in January 2020, and the statutorily required efforts were arguably non-existent. In re J.C.-B., 856 S.E.2d 883 (Mar. 16, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Neither the trial court’s order nor the department’s evaluation provided evidence to support findings specifically addressing the statutory factors; trial court found that the child’s therapist felt the child needed to remain with grandmother, that the
                        mother was taking medications for mood and anxiety, and that the mother did not file a report of her counseling or provide a signed release to her counselors, but these findings were inadequate to support the conclusion that reunification
                        efforts should cease. In re J.C.-B., 856 S.E.2d 883 (Mar. 16, 2021).

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s findings of fact reflecting the father’s progress directly contradicted the trial court’s conclusion that reunification would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with the health or safety of his children; the father completed all his services
                        and changed his behavior based on what he learned from those services. In re J.M., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. App.</cite> 291, 856 S.E.2d 904, 2021- NCCOA-92, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 110 (2021).

                        Trial court failed to make the findings required by G.S. 7B-906.2(b) and (d) to cease reunification efforts, which was reversible error; the evidence did not explain why it would be contrary to the child’s welfare to remain in foster care six more months
                        to allow the mother to try to secure housing. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 857 S.E.2d 332, 2021- NCCOA-93, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 123 (2021).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ceasing reunification efforts because its findings made clear that the trial court considered the evidence in light of whether reunification would be futile or inconsistent with the child’s health, safety, and
                        need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time. In re S.R.J.T., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 857 S.E.2d 345, 2021- NCCOA-94, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 122 (2021).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred when it ceased reunification efforts; mother engaged in all services required of her in order to correct the conditions that led to the removal of the children, including requiring the father to move out, and a finding that reunification
                        efforts would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with the children’s health, safety, and need for a permanent home was contradictory to all evidence presented to the trial court.

                        Court failed to make required findings of fact because, while the record contained little evidence presented by the parties on the issue of the mother’s availability, the written report to the trial court for the permanency planning hearing included information
                        about the mother’s attendance at court dates and scheduled visitations, as well as her failure to attend child and family team meetings; the information contained in the reports did not satisfy the trial court’s statutory obligation.

                        or would be inconsistent with the child’s health or safety. In re D.A., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 811 S.E.2d 729, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 224 (2018).

                        Trial court’s order ceasing reunification efforts and excluding reunification of a mother with the mother’s children as a permanent plan was not an abuse of discretion because the evidence supported the court’s finding that the mother only made some progress
                        with respect to the mother’s parenting skills. Moreover, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that ceasing reunification was in the best interests of the children. In re J.H., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 264</cite>,

                        Trial court complied with its obligations under the statue because it set a primary and secondary plan and determined that no further reunification efforts were required; the trial court’s findings, which were supported by testimony and evidence introduced
                        at the hearing, demonstrated that the father completely failed to comply with his case plan while the child was in a safety placement with her sister.

                        Findings were insufficient to demonstrate the degree of success or failure towards reunification as they demonstrated only that the Department of Social Services was unable to locate any services that could help the mother progress towards reunification
                        and that the mother was unable to make progress towards reunification because she was unable to obtain a U Visa; the trial court erred in removing reunification as a primary or secondary plan and in ceasing reunification efforts

                        reunification because the parent was unable to obtain a U Visa. In re E.A.C., 2021-NCCOA-298, 2021- NCCOA-298, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 306 (N.C. Ct. App. July 6, 2021).

                        Permanent guardianship of a child to foster parents was in err because nothing in the court’s permanency planning order or in the court’s rulings pronounced in open court supported the court’s conclusory finding that the biological parents were unfit
                        to parent the child. Furthermore, the trial court failed to make statutorily required findings of fact related to whether the parents demonstrated the degree of failure towards reunification necessary to support ceasing reunification

                        Nothing in the language of G.S. 48-9.1(1) gives foster parents standing to contest the department’s or agency’s exercise of its rights as legal custodian; therefore, foster parents are without standing to bring an action seeking custody of minor child

        Responsibility of Guardian ad Litem in Adoption Process. —

                    <p>
                        The legislature charged the county department of social services or other licensed child-placing agency with the responsibility of selecting adoptive parents. The guardian ad litem’s responsibility during this process is to raise any issue of the agency’s
                        abuse of discretion within ten days after she receives written notice of the filing of the adoption petition. The legislature provided no other responsibility for the guardian ad litem once a petition for adoption is filed and
                        none seems appropriate. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2700 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under G.S. 48-16(a), the legislature clearly vested the Department of Social Services with the duty and responsibility to make investigations regarding adoptions. Thus, absent any responsibilities or duties to perform, the guardian ad litem is superfluous
                        to an adoption proceeding. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2700 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The guardian ad litem is empowered under former G.S. 7A-659(f) (see now this section) to request information about and be consulted concerning the adoption selection process. This includes confidential adoption information regarding adoptive parents.
                        In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 242 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the duty and right of guardian ad litem to inquire into Department of Social Services’ handling of child’s adoption, and it was within the district court’s jurisdiction to order DSS to turn over requested information, despite its confidential nature.
                        In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 242 (1988).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guardian ad litem’s responsibility to child is intact for the 10-day period after he receives written notice of filing of adoption petition for the purpose of raising any issue of abuse of discretion. In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite>                        79, 365 S.E.2d 213, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 242 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Guardian ad litem who first made a motion to the court for information five days before receiving written notice that an adoption petition had been filed still had a responsibility and a duty, pursuant to former G.S. 7A-659(f) (see now this section),
                        at the time he received notice of the adoption petition to raise any issue of abuse of discretion. In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 242 (1988).

                        jurisdiction over adoption proceedings is vested solely in superior court. Thus, the district court has no jurisdiction to act once a petition for adoption is filed, and its jurisdiction is in abeyance once the petition is filed.

                        Court did not fail to find if the court should retain jurisdiction because (1) the court did not terminate jurisdiction and said the parties could ask the court to review visitation, (2) a mother did not claim the court wrongly kept jurisdiction or did
                        not follow statutory procedures, and (3) the mother did not support a claim that transfer to an N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 50 proceeding was not analyzed.

                        Trial court did not err in asserting jurisdiction over a child custody action after a juvenile proceeding was terminated because the court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the father’s custody claim once he invoked jurisdiction by filing a
                        motion; the juvenile order terminated the jurisdiction of the juvenile court over the child and, thus, the legal status of the juvenile and the custodial rights of the parties reverted to the status they were before the juvenile

                        There was no requirement that the trial court enter two different orders in a neglect action; the trial court could enter one order for placement in both the juvenile file and the civil file as long as the order was sufficient to support termination of
                        juvenile court jurisdiction and modification of custody. In re A.S., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 139, 641 S.E.2d 400, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 484 (2007).

                        Trial court’s order stating that it resolved any pending claim for custody complied with G.S. 7B-911 because it contained findings of fact which were relevant to the issue of the child’s best interest and welfare, and contained findings which established
                        that the mother failed to seek medical attention for the child, yet the father took appropriate action. In re T.H.T., <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C.

                        Trial court, in a custody case involving the son where reunification with a parent was the original goal and the county social services agency had obtained legal custody of him while awaiting a permanent disposition, did not enter a proper civil child-custody
                        order pursuant to G.S. 7B-911. It made no findings of fact regarding its decision to transfer the son’s juvenile case pursuant to “Chapter 50,” G.S. 50-13.1, and to terminate its jurisdiction. In re J.B.,

                        her behavior was erratic during visits, that the father tested negative for drugs, that his residence was appropriate for the child, and that it was in the best interest of the child to award custody to father. In re J.D.R.,

                        Trial court did not err in granting a mother legal and primary physical custody because the court was permitted to make an initial child custody determination since the juvenile court in the neglect proceeding returned custody to the parties; in the absence
                        of an existing permanent child custody order, the trial court was not required to find or conclude that there existed a substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child for purposes of modifying an existing

                        Mother’s parental rights to three children were properly terminated under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) because the children had been in an out-of home-placement since March 2008 neglect proceedings, and the court’s order converting the neglect case into a civil
                        custody case, pursuant to G.S. 7B-911, qualified as a “court order” under G.S. 7B-1111; the children were placed with the paternal grandparents after the neglect proceedings and, after a permanency planning review in September
                        2008, the grandparents were awarded legal and physical custody. In re L.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 739 S.E.2d 596, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 342 (2013).

                        Because the trial court did not make the required findings that there was no need for continued State intervention on behalf of the child, it erred in terminating its jurisdiction over the child by transferring the issue of the child’s custody to a North

                        Order granting the father custody of a child who was the subject of a juvenile petition was reversed because (1) the court intended to terminate juvenile court jurisdiction but six months had not passed since the court held the child’s permanent plan
                        was placing the child with the father, and (2) a finding that this period had passed was required since the child did not live with the father when the juvenile petition was filed.

                        Trial court erred in terminating the juvenile proceeding and initiating a civil action because it made no findings satisfying either subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), and the findings it did make did not allow the court of appeals to infer that those statutory

                        of law, because, based upon the evidence, there was no factual support for a conclusion that a mother was unfit to have custody of the mother’s children.

                        It is fundamental that before an order may be entered modifying a custody decree, there must be a finding of fact of changed conditions. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 334 S.E.2d 428, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 4049 (1985).

                        A decree of custody is entitled to such stability as would end the vicious litigation so often accompanying such contests, unless it be found that some change of circumstances has occurred affecting the welfare of the child so as to require modification
                        of the order. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 334 S.E.2d 428, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4049 (1985).

                        For case in which the court found no change in the needs of juvenile requiring that her custody be returned to her parents, see In re Botsford, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 330 S.E.2d 23, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 3613 (1985).

                        Evidence of prior neglect which led to an adjudication of neglect shows circumstances as they were and therefore is relevant to whether a change of circumstances has occurred since the court’s order. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite>                        242, 350 S.E.2d 140, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2693 (1986).

                        Where court had previously deemed it in the best interest of minor children who had been adjudicated neglected that mother comply with certain orders of the court, the court acted with full statutory authority when it later conducted a hearing upon social
                        worker’s subsequent motion and determined that mother’s refusal to cooperate with community-level services and orders applicable to her constituted a “change of circumstances” affecting the best interest of the children, sufficient
                        to require modification of prior custody orders. In re Brenner, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 350 S.E.2d 140, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2693 (1986).

                        mandatory, had run; the mother failed to show that she was prejudiced by the period of delay, as the mother did not take advantage of visitation and did not have contact with the petitioning agency, and the mother, pursuant to

                        Trial court, by making a minor child’s maternal aunt and uncle the guardians for the child, modified the child’s custody from the county department of social services to the aunt and uncle, which allowed the child’s father to appeal the permanency planning
                        order as to child pursuant to G.S. 7B-1001(a)(4). As a result, the appellate court had jurisdiction to consider the father’s challenge to the permanency planning order on the merits. In re J.V., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite>                        108, 679 S.E.2d 843, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1137 (2009).

                        Trial court’s order denying a guardian ad litem’s motion for relief was appealable because the order determined that a county department of social service’s voluntary dismissal of juvenile petitions was effective, thus depriving the trial court of jurisdiction,

                        Notwithstanding the trial court’s authority to take notice of the court’s own orders, it was problematic to allow the trial court’s findings in the first order on nonsecure custody to serve as the sole support for most findings in the neglect adjudication;
                        the trial court was not bound by the rules of evidence at the custody hearing and respondents had no right to appeal, and to allow the trial court to find adjudicatory facts by taking judicial notice of the court’s prior findings
                        undermined the procedural safeguards for adjudications. In re J.C.M.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 834 S.E.2d 670, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 842 (2019).

                        order-stating the parent’s desire to appeal both the adjudication order and the disposition order. Therefore, the parent’s appeal of both the adjudication order and the disposition order was properly before the appellate court.

                        Because a county’s department of social services (DSS) chose to file a petition to terminate parental rights, there were two actions relating to the child: the neglect proceeding and the termination of parental rights (TPR) proceeding. DSS’s claim that
                        the trial court was free to act in the neglect proceeding while the TPR order was on appeal did not comport with the legislature’s intent in enacting G.S. 7B-1003, as revealed by the long-standing interpretation given to G.S. 7B-1003

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper based on willful abandonment of her child as the mother made no effort to contact the child and paid nothing toward his support during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the grandparents’
                        petition to terminate because, while her parental rights had been previously terminated, there was no evidence that the mother sought to stay the order while her appeal was pending, or otherwise requested visitation with the child
                        from the trial court or the grandparents; she was not prohibited from contacting and visiting the child; and she demonstrated almost no interest in the child since losing custody of him. In re D.E.M.,

                    <p>
                        As to a trial court’s authority to enter orders pending an appeal, the rule adopted by the General Assembly for abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings (G.S. 7B-1003(b)(2)) is that the trial court may only enter orders affecting the custody or placement
                        of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile; if the appeal arises out of a termination of parental rights petition, then under G.S. 7B-1003(c) the court may enter a temporary order affecting the
                        custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile. The language in both subsections limits the trial court’s authority to the traditionally-recognized need to protect children pending
                        appeals. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 674 S.E.2d 789, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 376 (2009).

                        abuse, neglect, and dependency action — only to enter a temporary order affecting the custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile. In re K.L.,

                        then G.S. 7B-1003(c) applies. In re K.L., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 674 S.E.2d 789, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 376 (2009).

                        Termination order was improper under circumstances in which the trial court proceeded with the termination hearing before complying with the appellate mandate vacating permanency planning order, which changed the permanent plan from reunification to termination;
                        the legislature did not intend for its amendment of G.S. 7B-1003 to divest trial courts of jurisdiction over termination petitions during appeals of dispositional orders, but to nonetheless allow trial courts to avoid the effect

                        parents to delay termination proceedings by appealing custody review orders would have thwarted G.S. 7B-100(5), which sought to place children in safe, permanent houses within a reasonable amount of time. In re R.T.W.,

                        from exercising jurisdiction or holding hearings before the appellate court’s mandate issued, (2) the mandate’s issuance returned the power to exercise subject matter jurisdiction to the trial court, and (3) the trial court did
                        not exercise jurisdiction until after the mandate issued, as the trial court did not hear or decide the motion until after that issuance. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>, 722 S.E.2d

                        the Juvenile Code because the holding minimized procedural delay, which was unnecessary to protect parental rights, but which interfered with addressing a child’s needs, and was consistent with the obligation of the Department
                        of Social Services, under G.S. 7B-907(e) (repealed, see now G.S. 7B-906.1), to seek termination of parental rights within 60 days of a permanency planning hearing; allowing the timing of the filing of a termination motion to decide
                        if the trial court had jurisdiction elevated form over substance. In re M.I.W., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 374</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 469, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 22 (2012).

                        The general purpose of this Article is to provide judicial procedures for terminating the legal relationship between a juvenile and the juvenile’s biological or legal parents when the parents have demonstrated that they will not provide the degree of
                        care which promotes the healthy and orderly physical and emotional well-being of the juvenile.

                        a relationship with biological or legal parents.

                        Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights to his children because, while it was undisputed that he lacked minimum contacts with North Carolina, due process did not require a nonresident parent to have minimum contacts with the State to
                        establish personal jurisdiction for purposes of termination of parental rights proceedings since the protections usually afforded by the minimum contacts requirement were outweighed by the State’s interest in adjudicating the status
                        of children who resided in the state. In re F.S.T.Y., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 532</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 160, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 494 (2020).

                        parental rights. It provides for the basic procedural elements which are to be utilized in these cases. Due to the legislature’s prefatory statement in former G.S. 7A-289.22 (see now this section) with regard to its intent to establish
                        judicial procedures for the termination of parental rights, and due to the specificity of the procedural rules set out in the article, the legislative intent was that this Article (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>,
                        Article 11) exclusively control the procedure to be followed in the termination of parental rights. It was not the intent that the requirements of the Rules of Civil Procedure, G.S. 1A-1, be superimposed upon the requirements of
                        this Article. In re Allen, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 293 S.E.2d 607, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2763 (1982).

                        The judicial procedure to be used in termination of parental rights cases is prescribed by the legislature in this Article. The Rules of Civil Procedure, G.S. 1A-1, while they are not to be ignored, are not superimposed upon these hearings. In re Allen,
                        <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 293 S.E.2d 607, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2763 (1982).

                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother’s parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)
                        would be a possible ground to support termination, and G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660

                        While a determination of jurisdiction over child custody matters will precede a determination of jurisdiction over parental rights, it does not supplant the parental rights proceedings; the language of subdivision (4) of this section (now G.S. 7B-1100(4))

                        Given both the statement of legislative intent in G.S. 7B-1100(1) and the specificity of the procedures in G.S. 7B-100 et seq., Article 11 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>                        provides the exclusive procedures to be used in a termination of parental rights proceeding; a defendant therefore cannot rely on G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 13 as the basis for a counterclaim for termination of parental rights.

                    <p>
                        G.S. 7B-1100 et seq. does not provide a procedure through which a party may counterclaim for termination of parental rights in response to a complaint for child visitation; rather, Article 11 contemplates that a termination petition should be brought
                        in a separate action. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2419 (2007).

                        Because G.S. 7B-1100 et seq. provided the exclusive procedures for a termination of parental rights proceeding and contemplated that a termination petition be brought in a separate action, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a termination
                        of parental rights action brought as a counterclaim to a visitation action; although the trial court had tried to rectify the error by having summonses issued under G.S. 7B-1106(a), the issuance of a summons alone did not vest
                        a trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over an action that was never properly commenced. In re S.D.W. &amp; H.E.W., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 653 S.E.2d 429, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2419 (2007).

                        It was not an abuse of discretion, in a termination of parental rights proceeding, for a trial court to find that the subject child’s adoption by the child’s foster parents better served the child’s best interests than placement of the child with the
                        child’s relatives because the court (1) made findings regarding the relevant provisions of G.S. 7B-1110(a) and G.S. 7B-1100, (2) made extensive findings as to the relative situations of the foster parents and the child’s relatives,
                        and (3) specifically provided the court’s reasons for determining that the child’s best interests would be served by termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption by the child’s foster parents, finding the foster parents
                        had provided the child with a safe, stable, home, and the relatives did not timely present themselves in a reasonable time to provide the child a safe permanent home.

                        grounds to terminate parental rights be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a dual burden of proof was created in which the state provisions and federal provisions had to be satisfied separately; i.e., the state grounds for
                        termination had to be supported by clear and convincing evidence, while the federal law required evidence which justified termination beyond a reasonable doubt.

                        The legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care. Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care, and because the superior court has
                        jurisdiction over adoptions, that court’s jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin,

                        The legislature expressed its intent that the best interests of the child are controlling by recognizing the necessity for any child to have a permanent plan of care at the earliest possible age, and by providing that action which is in the best interests
                        of the child should be taken in all cases where the interests of the child and those of his or her parents or other persons are in conflict. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709,

                        Where the allegations contained in a petition or motion to terminate parental rights tend to show that the respondent is incapable of properly caring for his or her child because of mental illness, the trial court is required to appoint a guardian ad
                        litem to represent the respondent at the termination hearing pursuant to this section and G.S. 7B-1111(6). In re Estes, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 579 S.E.2d 496, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 734 (2003).

                        When a Division of Social Services pursues termination on the grounds of parental incapability under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6), the parent has the right to counsel, and to appointed counsel in cases of indigency, unless the parent waives the right. A guardian
                        ad litem shall also be appointed. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 129 (2004).

                        Although a trial court found, inter alia, that a mother suffered from significant mental health issues, it terminated her parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) because she had neglected her daughter; however, because the mother’s mental instability
                        was so intertwined with a child’s neglect, the trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother pursuant to G.S. 7B-1101 at a parental rights termination hearing. In re J.D.,

                        Mother was entitled to a guardian ad litem where the petition to terminate her parental rights alleged that depression and personality and emotional problems rendered her unable to parent her child; because the trial failed to appoint a guardian ad litem
                        for the mother, the termination order was reversed and the case was remanded. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 494, 602 S.E.2d 694, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        Order terminating the parental rights of both parents to four minor children was reversed on appeal, because the trial court erred by failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the parents, who had significant mental health issues that bore directly on
                        their ability to provide proper care and supervision of their children. In re B.M., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 607 S.E.2d 698, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 252 (2005).

                        Trial court did not err by not appointing a guardian ad litem for the mother for a termination of parental rights hearing as it was not alleged, pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6), that the mother was incapable of properly caring for her children; additionally,
                        whether the trial court should have appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother in a prior dependency proceeding was not an issue before the court on the appeal of the termination of the mother’s parental rights. In re O.C.,

                        Trial court erred when it failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for mother pursuant to prior language of G.S. 7B-1101 after reviewing her psychological evaluation, but still considered her mental illness, even though it never mentioned G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6)
                        as a factor in terminating her parental rights. Accordingly, the mother was entitled to a new termination hearing and the appointment of a guardian ad litem.

                        of the parent’s condition and the child’s neglect. In re C.B., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 614 S.E.2d 579, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1205 (2005).

                        in making that determination; therefore, G.S. 7B-1101 required appointment of a guardian ad litem for the mother, and the failure of the trial court to do so was error.

                        as required by G.S. 7B-1101(1), and regardless of whether that failure prejudiced the father, remand was required for appointment of a guardian ad litem and for rehearing.

                        Mother was not entitled to the appointment of a guardian ad litem in an action to terminate her parental rights; the mother’s sparse references to her need to counseling and drug treatment did not rise to the level of being so intertwined with the neglect
                        of her children and to be virtually inseparable and while the Department of Social Services recommended counseling, there was no significant evidence in the record to suggest that the mother’s parental rights were terminated due
                        to any mental illness or substance abuse. In re As.L.G., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 619 S.E.2d 561, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2116 (2005).

                        In termination of parental rights action, the trial court was not required to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother under G.S. 7B-1101, because the termination did not allege dependency. In re J.S.L., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        151, 628 S.E.2d 387, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 883 (2006).

                        Trial court terminated a mother’s parental rights based on: (1) neglect; (2) wilfully leaving the children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress; (3) wilfully failing to provide financial support to the children; and
                        (4) abandonment of the children for at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights; the mother did not request that a guardian ad litem (GAL) be appointed. Also, the petition
                        for termination of her parental rights did not allege the mother’s incapability to parent the children, and no allegations were asserted, and no showing was made that the mother was incompetent; thus, the trial court was not required
                        to appoint a GAL to the mother under either G.S. 7B-1101 and 35A-1101, or G.S. 1A-1-17 . In re D.H., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 629 S.E.2d 920, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1195 (2006).

                        After a mother filed a notice of appeal of a permanency planning order under G.S. 7B-1003(b), the trial court no longer had jurisdiction to rule on the petitions to terminate her parental rights under G.S. 7B-1101; consequently, the order terminating
                        the mother’s parental rights was void ab initio, and did not render moot the appeal of the permanency planning order. In re Z.J.T.B., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 645 S.E.2d 206,

                        County court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the petition for termination of the father’s parental rights because the very first allegation in the petitions to terminate parental rights was that the children were citizens and residents of
                        Washington State, which alone established the lack of subject matter jurisdiction for termination of parental rights; both children had resided in Washington state with the mother since 2007; they did not reside in and were not
                        found in Alexander County, North Carolina, when the petition was filed on October 17, 2011; and the children had never been in the legal or actual custody of the county department of social services or any child-placing agency.

                        Where a termination of rights petition did not address guardianship issues raised by the noncustodial parent respondent, where no custody order was attached, and where the trial court merely announced that it had decided the claimed guardianship was void,
                        without further explanation, it was impossible to review the trial court’s decision and the appeals court was forced to hold that the trial court had lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the facial defects of the petition.

                        Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court; that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance
                        County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure
                        by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.

                        G.S. 7B-1101.1 requires that a guardian ad litem be appointed in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17 to represent a parent, meaning that where an allegation is made that parental rights should be terminated, a trial court is
                        required to conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed to represent the parent, and an allegation under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6) serves as a triggering mechanism, alerting the trial court that it should
                        conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed; at the hearing, the trial court must determine whether the parents are incompetent within the meaning of G.S. 35A-1101, such that the individual would
                        be unable to aid in their defense at the termination of parental rights proceeding, and the trial court should always keep in mind that the appointment of a guardian ad litem will divest the parent of their fundamental right to
                        conduct his or her litigation according to their own judgment and inclination. In re J.A.A., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 623 S.E.2d 45, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        mother seventeen days after the petition for termination was filed and more than three months before the first hearing in the termination proceeding took place; G.S. 7B-1101.1(c) only mandates timely appointment of a guardian ad

                        Trial court acting under G.S. 7B-1101.1(c), must conduct a hearing in accordance with the procedures required under G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17, in order to determine whether there is a reasonable basis for believing that a parent is incompetent or
                        has diminished capacity and cannot adequately act in his or her own interest; if the court chooses to exercise its discretion to appoint a guardian ad litem under G.S. 7B-1101.1(c), then the trial court must specify the prong under
                        which it is proceeding, including findings of fact supporting its decision, and specify the role that the guardian ad litem should play, whether one of substitution or assistance. In re P.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite>                        460, 737 S.E.2d 152, <cite class="nc_code">2012 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1454 (2012).

                        Role of the guardian ad litem should be determined based on whether the trial court determines that the parent is incompetent or whether the trial court determines that the parent has diminished capacity and cannot adequately act in his or her own interest
                        G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17(e), which addresses the duties of a guardian ad litem for an incompetent person, should apply if the parent is incompetent, the role of the guardian ad litem should be one of substitution; on the other
                        hand, if the parent has diminished capacity, G.S. 7B-1101.1(e) should apply and the role of the guardian ad litem should be one of assistance. In re P.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 460,

                        appointment of a guardian ad litem if the parent has diminished capacity; the extent of the parent’s disability logically informs the role a guardian ad litem needs to play for the parent in a termination of parental rights proceeding.

                        When it was alleged that a mother’s parental rights to two children should be terminated because she (1) neglected them while they were in an agency’s care within the meaning of G.S. 7B-101, under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1), (2) willfully left the children in
                        foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their removal, under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), and (3) willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the children’s
                        care while in an agency’s custody, under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(3), there was no requirement that a guardian ad litem be appointed for the parent, even though the petition made reference to the mother’s drug abuse and mental illness,
                        because there was no allegation under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6) that the mother was incapable of caring for her children, she did not seek a guardian ad litem, and the trial court properly inquired into her competency, under G.S. 1A-1,

                        and a psychiatric evaluation, which found her to have a flare for dramatic behavior, to be easily excited, to be prone to emotional outbursts, to be overly sensitive to the opinions of others, and to be impulsive and rebellious,
                        did not constitute a diagnosis of a mental health issue; (3) as the mother had made threats to harm the child, it was prudent to require a psychological evaluation before visitation resumed; and (4) doubting the mother’s ability
                        to parent the child did not necessarily indicate that the mother was incapable of handling her affairs for G.S. 7B-1101.1(c) and G.S. 35A-1101 purposes.

                        herself and the mother read and signed the waiver of counsel form, which expressly stated that she did not want the assistance of a lawyer. In re J.K.P., <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 767

                        Respondent claimed that the order entered on her assistive guardian ad litem’s motion to withdraw was fatally deficient because it does not make adequate findings or conclusions, but respondent had no right to appeal this order, and even if she did, it
                        would have been lost due to her failure to provide timely written notice of her intent to exercise that right. In re J.R.W., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 765 S.E.2d 116, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1173 (2014).

                        Father was entitled to a new hearing on the termination of his parental rights because he was denied effective assistance of counsel; the father’s counsel did not make sufficient efforts to communicate with him in order to provide him with effective representation,
                        and that failure deprived the father of a fair hearing. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 767 S.E.2d 905, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 20 (2015).

                    <p>
                        In a termination of parental rights case, the record on appeal contained insufficient information to allow the appellate court to review the mother’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it was silent on the reasons why counsel did not object
                        during the testimony of the witnesses for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not cross-examine those witnesses, and did not present any evidence; the record did not compel a conclusion that the mother did not cooperate
                        with her counsel and waived her right to representation or undermined her counsel’s ability to advocate for her; and the appellate court declined to speculate about what counsel could have argued or how it would have affected the
                        outcome. In re C.D.H., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 829 S.E.2d 690, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 492 (2019).

                        Father failed to show that any of the alleged deficiencies in his counsel’s performance or conduct would have resulted in a different outcome, and thus father could not prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In re G.G.M.,

                        In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the father failed to show an error arising from the trial court’s failure to hold a rehearing in the abuse and neglect proceeding prior to the case, as such a hearing on abuse and neglect was redundant with
                        parts of the termination hearing, and there was a length of delay resulting from an earlier appeal, the status of the children and the need to determine permanency had changed.

                        of the notice was made mandatory by this section and G.S. 1A-1, Rule 5(b), and the agency’s failure to provide a proper notice was reversible error. Orange County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Alexander,

                        to terminate under G.S. 7B-1102 in an ongoing juvenile abuse, neglect, and dependency case, the summons would not have been required, and the agency would only have been required to service notice of the motion to terminate on

                        Evidence supported the trial court’s finding that a child resided continuously with his grandmother for the two-year period immediately preceding the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights. Consequently, the grandmother had standing under

                        District court re-acquired subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings because the Department of Social Services (DSS) initiated a new action by issuing a new summons and filing a termination of parental rights petition against the father and the
                        DSS had standing to file the petition under G.S. 7B-1103 due to the mother’s relinquishment of custody of her daughter to the DSS. In re A.L., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 781 S.E.2d 856,

                        Orders granting the county department of social services (DSS) custody of a child were not void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and DSS had standing to file the petition to terminate the mother’s parental rights, because the trial court had “home

                        In a case in which the court appointed custodians of a minor child filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child’s mother, the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the custodians lacked standing. The custodians did not fit within any
                        of the requirements under G.S. 7B-1103(a), and contrary to their argument, their status as custodians of the minor child did not give them the same rights as a guardian; G.S. 7B-1103 referred to both custody and guardianship, and
                        it could not be held that the words custody and judicially appointed guardian as used in G.S. 7B-1103 were not intended to have specific, distinct meanings.

                        Two-year period required under G.S. 7B-1103(a)(5) was not tolled until a mother reached the age of majority, even though the mother did not have a guardian ad litem appointed in earlier neglect and dependency proceedings, as the mother was an adult during
                        the entire termination of parental rights proceeding, was represented by counsel, and did not directly attack the prior neglect and dependency proceedings based on the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother; G.S.
                        7B-1103(a)(5) was not a statute of limitations, or the equivalent of one. In re E.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 623 S.E.2d 300, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2724

                        While it is a correct statement of the law that a statute of limitations is tolled during the minority of a plaintiff, it does not follow that the two-year requirement of G.S. 7B-1103(a)(5) is a statute of limitations or the equivalent of such; this statute
                        confers standing on the petitioners to file a termination of parental rights proceeding based on their two-year relationship with the child, which is in no manner related to the parent or his or her relationship with the child
                        during that two-year period, and the person or persons with whom legal custody lies during this time period is irrelevant. In re E.T.S., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 623 S.E.2d 300,

                        Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court; that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance
                        County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure
                        by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.

                        of parental rights petitions, and the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to enter the termination orders as: (1) the petition for adjudication with respect to child one contained a “Signature of Petitioner” as
                        the “Director of DSS by an employee” and did not contain the signature of the director under G.S. 10B-3(25); (2) DSS filed an amended petition regarding child two with no signature in the “Signature of Petitioner” space; and (3)

                        Like the verified pleadings in divorce and juvenile actions, verified petitions for the termination of parental rights are necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter. In re Triscari Children,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 426 S.E.2d 435, <cite class="nc_code">1993 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 224 (1993).

                    <p>
                        Because the petition for termination of parental rights was not accompanied by a copy of the custody order then in effect, the petition failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court; that omission need not have been fatal if the Vance
                        County Department of Social Services (DSS) had simply amended the petition by attaching the proper custody order or otherwise ensured the custody order was made a part of the record before the trial court. Thus, it was the failure
                        by the DSS either to attach the custody order to the petition or to remedy that omission that ultimately deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        790, 629 S.E.2d 895, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1224 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Where Vance County Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a motion for termination of parental rights, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction only if the record included a copy of an order, in effect when the petition was filed, that awarded
                        DSS custody of the child; that was implicitly recognized by G.S. 7B-1104(5), which set out the requirements for a petition for termination of parental rights, and provided in part that the petition would set forth the name and
                        address of any person or agency to whom custody of the juvenile had been given by a court of North Carolina or any other state, and a copy of the custody order would be attached to the petition or motion for termination. In re
                        T.B., <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 790, 629 S.E.2d 895, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1224 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Although a social services agency filed a petition to terminate a parent’s parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1102, the petition was not verified as required by G.S. 7B-1104; therefore, the trial court never obtained jurisdiction over the termination
                        action, and the trial court’s termination of parental rights order was void. In re T.R.M., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 702 S.E.2d 108, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Director’s verification of the contents of the termination motion satisfied the concerns that underlay the verification requirement enunciated in § 7B-1104 despite the notary’s failure to record the date upon which the verification was made, and thus,
                        the termination motion substantially complied with the verification requirement enunciated in § 7B-1104 and sufficed to give the trial court subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the parents’ parental rights in the child. In
                        re C.N.R., 2021-NCSC-150, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 409</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 666, 2021- NCSC-150, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1327 (2021).

                        DSS’s failure to attach a custody order to a termination of parental rights petition in accordance with G.S. 7B-1104(5) was not fatal as a mother did not demonstrate any prejudice arising from the technical defect, as there was no indication that the

                        DSS’s failure to attach a custody order to a termination of parental rights petition in accordance with G.S. 7B-1104(5) was not fatal, as a father did not demonstrate any prejudice arising from the technical defect as from the time the father became a
                        party to the case through his second counsel’s withdrawal, he was consistently represented by counsel at hearings at which it was made abundantly clear that his child was in DSS custody, and the attorneys’ knowledge was imputed

                        When an incarcerated parent is denied transportation to the hearing in contested termination cases, the better practice is for the court, when so moved, to provide the funds necessary for the deposing of the incarcerated parent. The parent’s deposition,
                        combined with representation by counsel at the hearing, will ordinarily provide sufficient participation by the incarcerated parent so as to reduce the risk of error attributable to his absence to a level consistent with due process.

                        Trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the father’s petition for termination of the mother’s parental rights due to the father’s failure to include language, required under G.S. 7B-1104(7), that the petition “has not been filed to circumvent the
                        provisions of Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement

                        Trial court did not err in considering the issue of neglect due to the father’s failure to allege that the mother had neglected the child since, under G.S. 7B-1104(6), the factual allegations in the father’s petition were sufficient to give the mother
                        notice as to the issue of neglect. In re Humphrey, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 577 S.E.2d 421, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 236 (2003).

                        were sufficient to put the mother on notice of neglect allegations. In re A.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 612 S.E.2d 639, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 797 (2005).

                        Although the termination of parental rights petition did not specifically refer to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6), the petition, which contained language directly paralleling G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6), provided the mother with sufficient notice of the acts, omissions, or
                        conditions on which the petition was based. In re A.H., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 644 S.E.2d 635, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1159 (2007).

                        Termination petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the trial court; the father asserted no prejudice from the alleged omissions, and none were found. The father had access to all required information and the petition was substantially compliant

                        Father’s claim in termination of parental rights proceeding that the petition to terminate was deficient because the underlying juvenile petition was deficient had to be rejected; the underlying juvenile petition was sufficient to confer jurisdiction
                        on the trial court because it was verified, and the petition to terminate was proper because it was signed and verified. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1,

                        Petitioner specifically alleged that since September 2017, respondent had declined to exercise visitation as permitted by the trial court; thus, the petition contained more than a mere recitation of the statutory grounds for termination and gave respondent
                        sufficient notice of the acts or omissions at issue, and thus the trial court’s denial of respondent’s motion to dismiss was appropriate. In re B.C.B., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 32</cite>, 839 S.E.2d

                        Defendant’s proposed use of G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15 to deprive the court of personal jurisdiction over the newly identified biological father, despite compliance with G.S. 7B-1105, through the creation of a “new action” when the biological father
                        was eventually identified and made a party to the action would have defeated the entire purpose of G.S. 7B-1104 and G.S. 7B-1105; therefore, the biological father was properly added as a party to the termination proceeding pursuant
                        to the trial court’s order and the subsequent issuance and service upon him of the summons and petition to terminate parental rights in the minor child. Because G.S. 7B-1105(b) did not require that the Department of Social Services
                        file an amended petition upon identification of the unknown parent, and the amended petition did not change or otherwise add an additional ground for terminating the father’s parental rights and did not add a party to the proceeding
                        as the biological father was already a party to the termination proceeding, the amended petition to terminate parental rights to the minor child did not supersede the original petition such that a new action was brought upon its

                        While there was sufficient evidence to support the termination of mother’s parental rights with regard to her two older children, including the children’s multiple placements in foster homes, the mother’s severe mental problems, and the mother’s inability
                        to provide a stable residence, the trial court should have dismissed the Department of Social Services’ petition for termination of parental rights as to her youngest child, removed from her care the day after its birth, because
                        the petition did not allege any facts to support the allegation that the mother was unable to provide for the proper care and supervision of this child, as was required by G.S. 7B-1104(6). In re Hardesty,

                        Where a termination of rights petition did not address guardianship issues raised by the noncustodial parent respondent, where no custody order was attached, and where the trial court merely announced that it had decided the claimed guardianship was void,
                        without further explanation, it was impossible to review the trial court’s decision and the appeals court was forced to hold that the trial court had lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the facial defects of the petition.

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court erred in allowing the county department of social services to amend the petitions to terminate a mother’s parental rights to conform to the evidence, the original petitions failed to put the mother on notice that G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2)
                        would be a possible ground to support termination, and G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed. In re B.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 660

                    <p>
                        Because the allegations in the termination of parental rights petition were bare recitations of the alleged statutory grounds for termination listed in G.S. 7B-1111, the motion to terminate the mother’s parental rights failed to comply with this section,
                        and was insufficient to put the mother on notice as to what acts, omissions, or conditions were at issue, and the termination of her rights was improper.

                        It was improper to terminate a father’s parental rights for leaving the children in foster care for 12 months without reasonable progress to alleviate the conditions leading to the children’s removal because the petition alleged no such ground, so the
                        father had no notice of the allegation. In re L.S., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 822 S.E.2d 506, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1164 (2018).

                        Former G.S. 7A-289.26 (see now this section) contains no provision to determine the “whereabouts” of the parent whose parental rights the petitioner seeks to terminate; rather, the section authorizes a preliminary hearing to ascertain the name or identity
                        of such parent. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 83, 332 S.E.2d 196, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3721 (1985).

                        Defendant’s proposed use of G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15 to deprive the court of personal jurisdiction over the newly identified biological father, despite compliance with G.S. 7B-1105, through the creation of a “new action” when the biological father
                        was eventually identified and made a party to the action would have defeated the entire purpose of G.S. 7B-1104 and G.S. 7B-1105; therefore, the biological father was properly added as a party to the termination proceeding pursuant
                        to the trial court’s order and the subsequent issuance and service upon him of the summons and petition to terminate parental rights in the minor child. Because G.S. 7B-1105(b) did not require that the Department of Social Services
                        file an amended petition upon identification of the unknown parent, and the amended petition did not change or otherwise add an additional ground for terminating the father’s parental rights and did not add a party to the proceeding
                        as the biological father was already a party to the termination proceeding, the amended petition to terminate parental rights to the minor child did not supersede the original petition such that a new action was brought upon its
                        filing. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 684 S.E.2d 463, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1616 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Father’s paternity of the subject child in a termination of parental rights proceeding was sufficiently found because, while the father’s putative paternity was sufficient to terminate the father’s putative parental rights, the trial court sufficiently
                        identified the father as the child’s father as the judgment found the father lied about fathering the child and referred to the father’s mother as the child’s paternal grandmother. In re A.N.S., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        46, 767 S.E.2d 699, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 16 (2015).

                        It was no error to terminate a father’s parental rights without holding a preliminary hearing to find the father’s paternity because, inter alia, contingent alternative allegations about a “John Doe” father were not inconsistent with the father’s paternity,
                        as (1) no factual allegations suggested John Doe’s paternity, and (2) the allegation’s contingency was consistent with allegations that the father was not named on the birth certificate and paternity had not been judicially established.

                        Trial court did not err by exercising personal jurisdiction over a mother with regard to terminating her parental rights to her son by serving the summons required by G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5) upon the attorney advocate of the child’s guardian ad litem rather
                        than the guardian ad litem, because the guardian ad litem did not object at trial to the sufficiency of service nor did the guardian ad litem argue the issue on appeal; the mother actually lacked standing to challenge service of
                        the summons in that she was not an aggrieved party on that issue. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1589 (2005).

                        Because no summons was issued to the juvenile as required by G.S. 7B-1106(a), the order terminating the father’s parental rights had to be vacated. In re K.A.D., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 653 S.E.2d 427,

                        Because a county agency failed to issue a summons to a minor child or the child’s guardian ad litem under G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5), the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights proceeding; had the agency filed a motion
                        to terminate under G.S. 7B-1102 in an ongoing juvenile abuse, neglect, and dependency case, the summons would not have been required, and the agency would only have been required to service notice of the motion to terminate on
                        the parties specified in G.S. 7B-1106.1. In re I.D.G., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 655 S.E.2d 858, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 195 (2008).

                        Pursuant to G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5), the summons had to name the juvenile in order for the trial court to acquire subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile in a case involving the termination of parental rights. In re A.F.H-G,

                        Though the child was not served the summons required by G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5), nor was the child’s guardian ad litem, but rather, the guardian ad litem’s attorney advocate received the summons regarding the termination of parental rights proceeding, such
                        procedural irregularity caused no prejudice to the parents and the guardian ad litem never objected to the same. In re B.D., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 620 S.E.2d 913, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2387 (2005).

                        Termination of a mother’s parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) was vacated because the mother was not provided notice of the termination hearing as required by G.S. 7B-1106, as there was no evidence that the addresses to which notices were sent
                        were the mother’s dwelling, and this fact, along with the fact that the mother did not attend the hearing or respond in any way, refuted the presumption of valid service under G.S. 1A-1-4(j)(2). In re K.N.,

                        Where a petition to terminate parental rights was captioned with the names of both children, but the summons that was issued referenced only the younger child, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the mother’s parental rights
                        in the older child because a summons pertaining to the child was not issued. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 683

                    <p>
                        When a juvenile’s guardian ad litem was represented by an attorney advocate in a termination of parental rights proceeding, the service of a summons on the attorney advocate amounted to service on the guardian ad litem. Therefore, service of the summons
                        on the guardian ad litem constituted service on the juvenile, as expressly stated in G.S. 7B-1106(a). In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 716 (2008).

                        Because the captions of the summonses named the children, and because the guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed for the children certified that the GAL was served with a copy of the summonses, pursuant to G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5), the trial court had subject matter
                        jurisdiction over the mother’s parental rights termination proceedings. In re N.C.H., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 665 S.E.2d 812, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1621

                        Since the failure of a summons to comply with G.S. 7B-1106(a)(5) implicated the trial court’s jurisdiction over the children, not over the termination of parental rights action as a whole, pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1), a general appearance
                        by the children’s guardian ad litem and attorney advocate waived any objection to the jurisdictional requirements of G.S. 7B-1101. In re J.T., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 1</cite>, 672 S.E.2d 17, 2009

                        Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over termination of parental rights proceedings against a mother and father because the caption of the summons contained the name of their child, and copies of the summons and petition were served on the child’s
                        guardian ad litem at the county courthouse. In re I.T.P-L, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 670 S.E.2d 282, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2234 (2008).

                        Trial court erred in terminating the parental rights of parents to their minor children; the notice of the action required by this section provided to the parents by an agency failed to meet the statutory requirements for such a notice, the service of

                        to terminate under G.S. 7B-1102 in an ongoing juvenile abuse, neglect, and dependency case, the summons would not have been required, and the agency would only have been required to service notice of the motion to terminate on

                        failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the child; it was improper to punish the child for the father’s late response. In re J.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 721, 608 S.E.2d 823,

                        As G.S. 7B-601 and G.S. 7B-1108 mandated the guardian ad litem’s (GAL) physical presence at a termination of parental rights hearing, because a GAL was not present the court presumed prejudice, as the children were not represented by a GAL at a critical
                        stage of the termination proceedings. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 695 S.E.2d 162, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1148 (2010), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 171</cite>,

                        While the presence of the minor children’s nonattorney guardian ad litem (GAL) volunteer at a termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing was preferable, the nonlawyer volunteer’s attendance was not mandatory because, given the role of the attorney advocate
                        to assist the GAL, the general assembly did not intend by the use of the word “represent” in G.S. 7B-1108(b) to obligate the volunteer GAL to appear in court during the TPR hearing unless the attorney advocate or the trial court
                        deemed the GAL’s presence necessary to protect the minor’s best interests; G.S. 7B-1108 did not impose on the GAL volunteer a special duty to “represent” a juvenile beyond what G.S. 7B-601 required of a GAL as an appointed member
                        of the GAL program. The GAL program performed the duties listed in 7B-601(a). In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 171</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 118, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 384 (2011).

                        Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child from the beginning of a termination proceeding; a GAL and an attorney advocate performed distinct and separate roles, so the appointment of the attorney advocate as the GAL
                        after three and a half days of testimony was insufficient, even though the advocate had been involved in the case from an earlier time. In re R.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 614 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not err in conducting a permanency planning review hearing in the absence of a guardian ad litem appointed to represent a juvenile because the juvenile’s mother neither asserted nor argued prejudice as a result of the absence of a guardian
                        ad litem at the permanency planning hearing; according to the plain language of G.S. 7B-1108 and G.S. 7B-601, the guardian ad litem’s appointment did not terminate until the permanent plan had been achieved for the juvenile and
                        approved by the court, and consequently, the guardian ad litem was required to continue to represent the juvenile at the permanency planning review hearing, but, standing alone, the failure to adhere to the requirement during a
                        permanency planning hearing did not warrant reversal and, as such, the matter was subject to harmless error review. In re H.K.L., <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 820 (N.C. Ct. App. May

                        In a termination of parental rights case, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to forego guardian ad litem (GAL) assistance in determining the child’s best interests because a social worker testified about the child’s current foster care placement,
                        his relationship with his foster parents, and his emotional and developmental needs; the mother testified about her current living arrangement, employment, drug and alcohol abstinence, and family support system; the grandmother
                        testified about her desire and ability to assume the child’s care and custody; and the trial court’s comments at the conclusion of the termination hearing clearly demonstrated that the child’s best interests were carefully weighed
                        against the evidence presented. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1250 (2016).

                        Attorney who was appointed to serve as guardian ad litem (GAL) and attorney advocated investigated the case prior to the termination hearing and reported his observations to the trial court, such that competently fulfilled his role as GAL, and the trial
                        court’s clerical oversight in its execution of the proper form regarding its failure to check the GAL designation box for the person whom it properly designated on the same form to serve as attorney advocate was not prejudicial

                        Petition to terminate a mother’s parental rights was not filed by a guardian ad litem, and no guardian ad litem had previously been appointed for the child; therefore, the trial court was required to appoint the child a guardian ad litem under G.S. 7B-1108(b),
                        although the mother did not preserve this issue for appeal. In re A.D.N., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 752 S.E.2d 201, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1250 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Because the mother failed to object to the lack of a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the child during the termination proceedings, the issue was not preserved for appellate review; furthermore, the appellate court did not find it necessary to invoke the rule
                        suspending the Rules of Appellate Procedure to prevent manifest injustice to either the mother or the child and to review the decision not to appoint a GAL in light of the mother’s willful failure to make progress on her case plan,
                        both before and after reunification efforts were ceased, and because a GAL appointment was not statutorily required. In re P.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 794 S.E.2d 843, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1250 (2016).

                        Mother failed to preserve the issue of whether a child should been appointed a guardian ad litem for appellate review where she had not objected at trial, and she made no argument that invocation of N.C. R. App. P. 2 was necessary to prevent manifest
                        injustice. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1032 (2017).

                        Terminating a father’s parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as the father sought the children’s custody
                        during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children’s custody to others, terminating the father’s child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and purporting to waive any objection to termination,
                        erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order’s terms did not meet statutory requirements
                        for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d 741, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        Because proof of both the parent’s incapability to provide proper care and supervision and the parent’s lack of an alternative child care arrangement is required to terminate parental rights under subsection (a)(6), a trial court may adjudicate the nonexistence
                        of this ground by finding the absence of either element, or by finding the petitioner’s failure to prove either element by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,

                        Trial court must comply with G.S. 7B-1109(e) and G.S. 7B-1110(c) in denying a petition for the termination of parental rights; this reiterates that the trial courts must make findings of those material and ultimate facts from which it can be determined
                        whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether they support the conclusions of law reached, and this requirement is consistent with the trial court’s duty regarding the entry of judgments following civil bench trials.

                        By its own terms, G.S. 7B-1109(e) applies equally to instances in which the trial court adjudicates the existence or nonexistence of any of the circumstances set forth in G.S. 7B-1111; consequently, G.S. 7B-1109(e) places the same duty on the trial court
                        to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, regardless of whether the court is granting or denying a petition to terminate parental rights. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>,

                        Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile’s adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child’s adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                        was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father’s parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 645</cite>,

                        Trial court’s finding that the essential underlying issues of the neglect adjudication that concerned the father were his abuse of alcohol and illegal substances as well as housing and employment instability was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing
                        evidence because although the direct issues that led to the adjudication of neglect primarily related to the mother, the trial court was permitted to consider indirect issues which contributed to the child’s neglect and removal.

                        Termination of a mother’s parental rights was inappropriate because all findings of fact had to be based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. However, the factual findings which the trial court made were insufficient to support the termination of

                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court’s findings of fact regarding the father’s failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                        after her entry into state custody; as a result, the record adequately supported the trial court’s finding concerning the inconsistency of the father’s contacts. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 349</cite>,

                        Former G.S. 7A-289.30 and former G.S. 7A-289.31, when read together, mean that in the adjudication stage, the petitioner must prove clearly, cogently, and convincingly the existence of one or more of the grounds for termination listed in former G.S. 7A-289.32.
                        Once the petitioner has proven this ground by this standard, it has met its burden within the statutory scheme of former G.S. 7A-289.30 and 7A-289.31. The petitioner having met his burden of proof at the adjudication stage, the
                        court then moves on to the disposition stage, where the court’s decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 101</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 246, 1984 N.C.

                        or the probability of its repetition, existed at the time of the termination proceeding. The court then had to determine whether termination was in the child’s best interest. In re Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Reber,

                        any of the circumstances set forth in G.S. 7B-1111, which authorize the termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition is governed by G.S. 7B-1110, which provides in relevant part that, upon a finding that any one
                        or more of the conditions authorizing a termination of the parental rights of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent unless the court shall further determine that the best
                        interests of the juvenile require that the parental rights of the parent not be terminated under G.S. 7B-1111(a). In re Baker, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C.

                        Adjudication and disposition are the two phases required by subsection (e) of this section in a termination of parental rights proceeding, but there exists no requirement that the two phases be conducted during separate hearings. At the adjudication phase,
                        the petitioner has the burden of proving there is clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supporting at least one statutory ground under G.S. 7B-1111 for termination, and at the disposition phase, the determination is whether it
                        is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2181 (2003).

                        During the initial adjudication phase of the trial, the petitioner seeking termination must show by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that grounds exist to terminate parental rights and a finding of any one of those grounds is sufficient to support
                        termination of parental rights. If the petitioner succeeds in establishing the existence of any one of the statutory grounds, the trial court moves to the second, or dispositional, stage, where it determines whether it is in the
                        best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights; so long as the court applies the different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings.

                        Failure to conduct a termination hearing within 90 days after petition was filed did not require reversal because the father was not prejudiced by the delay; the Department of Social Services stated that the long delay was the result of it’s inability

                        Failure to hold a termination of parental rights hearing within 90 days did not require reversal because the oldest child’s detailed plan showed that the delay was due to the extraordinary efforts by the trial court to allow the mother to demonstrate
                        an ability to parent the three younger children by monitoring the mother’s performance in parenting the older child; rather than prejudicing the mother, the efforts inured to the mother’s benefit, affording the mother every possible

                        Time limitations in the Juvenile Code were not jurisdictional in termination cases and did not require reversal of orders in the absence of a showing by the appellant of prejudice resulting from the time delay; the mother made no serious effort to establish
                        prejudice, but rather argued that the late filing resulted in prejudice per se, which was a contention consistently rejected, and in any event, the record revealed no violation of G.S. 7B-1109(a) under circumstances in which the
                        continuances of the termination hearing were because of the need to appoint new counsel for the mother, to allow time for responsive pleadings, to allow the mother discovery, and to allow sufficient time to fully hear the case.

                        In a termination of parental rights case where the trial court failed to adhere to the statutory time for holding a hearing, the father should have filed a petition for writ of mandamus but offered no explanation for his failure to do so at any point
                        during the 33 months between the filing of the termination petition and the termination hearing. Instead, the father sat on his rights and allowed the delay to continue without objection. In re C.R.L.,

                        by G.S. 7B-1109(f); the only evidence presented to the trial court on this subject established that she had been employed at various times since 1999 and did not address whether she was employed during the six months preceding

                        When a trial court did not sign a written order terminating a father’s parental rights within 30 days of the hearing resulting in that order, the trial court’s statutory violation did not require that its order be vacated, as no authority compelled such

                        he suffered any prejudice from the trial court’s delay. In re J.L.K., <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 598 S.E.2d 387, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1162 (2004).

                        Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction over a termination of parental rights hearing because the trial court did not comply with the time limits as set forth in G.S. 7B-1109(a) and (d) as: (1) each continuance granted by the trial court
                        was necessary in order for all the essential parties to be present and to provide testimony and evidence at the termination hearing; (2) at no time did mother object to any delay or continuance; and (3) the mother failed to provide

                        the delay inured to the mother’s benefit since it gave the mother more time to address housing, employment, individual counseling, and substance abuse issues.

                        Seven month delay between a termination hearing and the trial court’s entry of its termination order ran counter to the legislative intent in enacting the 30-day requirement of G.S. 7B-1109(e) and G.S. 7B-1110(a), and prejudiced the mother, who was prevented
                        from filing an appeal until seven months after the hearing; pending the appellate court’s determination of the appeal, the child remained in the department’s custody, and subsequent court proceedings involving the child were limited

                        beyond the 90-day deadline of G.S. 7B-1109(a) before a hearing was held on the petition, the delay was egregious because the services’ termination of the mother’s visitations with the children constituted a de facto termination
                        of the mother’s parental rights 14 months prior to the matter actually coming before the trial court; for 14 months the mother was denied the company and familial relationship with her children solely through the inaction of the

                        her extreme neglect of her two minor children, such supported the termination of her parental rights; moreover, as the trial court announced its adjudication of neglect and its decision to terminate the mother’s parental rights
                        in open court, the delay in reducing the trial court’s order to writing did not prejudice the mother and, thus, did not warrant reversal of the termination order.

                        Order terminating mother’s parental rights to her four minor children was proper because the children were previously adjudicated neglected, there was a probability of repetition of neglect if returned to the mother, four to five trial placements with
                        the mother had failed, the mother had a history of failing to show a positive response to counseling and educational programs, the mother left a stable job and housing to move to another state where she did not have employment
                        or independent housing, and she had been unable to cope with the pressure of caring for the children at the same time, with such findings being sufficient to establish neglect under G. S. 7B-1111(a)(1). In re L.O.K.,

                        Termination of a father’s parental rights based on the probability of repetition of neglect was supported by substantial evidence that showed that the father made no effort to visit his son in the five months prior to termination hearing, that the father
                        met with a parenting class instructor only once even though parenting classes were part of case plan, and that the father held only occasional part-time jobs.

                        District court’s findings supported the conclusion that the father’s parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father’s care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in
                        constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Ground of neglect for termination of a father’s parental rights existed because the father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father’s
                        ability to parent the child, and lacked stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would have occurred in the
                        future if the child were to have been placed with the father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 259 (2020).

                        Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights based on neglect as there was no requirement that he be responsible for the prior adjudication of neglect, he made minimal efforts to show interest in the child while incarcerated, and the record
                        evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan’s requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court’s findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the father’s
                        care, the father was responsible for the lack of visitation, and his convictions and sentence were drug-related. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 67</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 315, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 275

                        In light of the frequent interchangeable usage of the terms “ground” and “grounds” in legal authorities to refer to a singular basis for a decision, the trial court did not harbor a mistaken belief that multiple statutory grounds for termination were
                        necessary in order to terminate a father’s parental rights; by itself, the trial court’s use of the phrase “necessary grounds,” which pluralized the term “ground,” did not connote the commission of error by the trial court. In

                        In determining whether there is neglect which authorizes the termination of parental rights, the trial court is allowed to consider a previous adjudication of neglect. It must also consider any evidence of changed conditions in light of the evidence of

                        The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence do not apply. Therefore, the trial court could properly
                        consider written psychological reports in determining, on a motion brought by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of the children would best be served by modification

                        Factual findings must be based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Such properly supported findings are binding on appeal, even though there may be evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, findings of fact not excepted to are deemed to be supported

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed to obtain stable housing for at least six months
                        as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and she failed to complete the recommended treatment

                        Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father’s incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                        to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court’s finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                        a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court’s finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not required
                        to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 33 (2020).

                        Where a jailed father asked not to be taken to court to appear at a parental rights termination hearing, it showed that the child was not a priority and that the child was a neglected and abandoned; termination of the father’s parental rights was therefore
                        in the child’s best interest. Whittington v. Hendren, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 576 S.E.2d 372, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 132 (2003).

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the son’s best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                        permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>, 835 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in the children’s best interests to terminate a mother’s parental rights because the trial court thoroughly considered the children’s developmental challenges and their likelihood of adoption
                        based on the children’s then placement and potential future adoptive parents. Furthermore, there was testimony that the children were thriving and showing great improvement developmentally in their placements. In re J.H.,

                        Findings fully supported the trial court’s conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a mother’s parental rights based upon her willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care during the children’s placement in county department of social
                        services custody because the mother was on notice of her failure to pay something towards the cost of care for her children; the trial court repeatedly found in its permanency planning orders that none of the parents were paying

                        County department of social services did not satisfy its burden of proving the allegations in its juvenile petitions by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence under G.S. 7B-1109 because the subject children were not neglected juveniles under G.S. 7B-101(15),
                        nor dependant juveniles under G.S. 7B-101(9); the trial court in its ruling properly entered uncontested findings of fact that: (1) the father possessed a gun, but did not point it at the mother or the children during a domestic
                        disturbance; (2) the parents’ three oldest children left their residence with the father, but no kidnapping was reported, and an Amber Alert was not issued; (3) the district attorney’s office dismissed the charges against the father
                        for communicating threats to and assault by pointing a gun at the mother; and (4) the father was not in possession of a gun when he was arrested. In re H.M., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 308,

                        Order terminating a father’s parental rights was improper because it did not identify any G.S. 7B-1111(a) grounds for termination and did not indicate the evidentiary standard under which the trial court made its adjudicatory findings of fact; without
                        an identified basis for adjudication, effective review of the termination order was precluded, and without a finding of willfulness, there was insufficient basis for a finding of abandonment, and the father’s incarceration alone
                        was insufficient to support the termination order. Bolick v. Brizendine, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 643 S.E.2d 77, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 787 (2007).

                        Terminating a father’s parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as the father sought the children’s custody
                        during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children’s custody to others, terminating the father’s child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and purporting to waive any objection to termination,
                        erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order’s terms did not meet statutory requirements
                        for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d 741, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        Trial court must comply with G.S. 7B-1109(e) and G.S. 7B-1110(c) in denying a petition for the termination of parental rights; this reiterates that the trial courts must make findings of those material and ultimate facts from which it can be determined
                        whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether they support the conclusions of law reached, and this requirement is consistent with the trial court’s duty regarding the entry of judgments following civil bench trials.

                        The termination of parental rights statute provides for a two-stage termination proceeding: G.S. 7A-289.30 [see now G.S. 7B-1109] governs the adjudication stage, while this section governs the disposition stage of a termination proceeding. In re Montgomery,

                        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights on the grounds of abuse, a prior adjudication of abuse was binding upon the court. It still had to be shown, however, by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, that the grounds for termination, i.e., abuse
                        or the probability of its repetition, existed at the time of the termination proceeding. The court then had to determine whether termination was in the child’s best interest. In re Alleghany County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Reber,

                        Proceeding for termination of parental rights requires the trial court to conduct a two part inquiry; G.S. 7B-1109(e) directs that the court first shall take evidence, find the facts, and shall adjudicate the existence or nonexistence of any of the circumstances
                        set forth in G.S. 7B-1111, which authorize the termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition is governed by this section, which provides in relevant part that upon a finding that any one or more of the conditions
                        authorizing a termination of the parental rights of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent unless the court shall further determine that the best interests of the juvenile
                        require that the parental rights of the parent not be terminated under G.S. 7B-1111(a). In re Baker, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 581 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1194 (2003).

                    <p>
                        During the initial adjudication phase of the trial, the petitioner seeking termination must show by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that grounds exist to terminate parental rights and a finding of any one of those grounds is sufficient to support
                        termination of parental rights. If the petitioner succeeds in establishing the existence of any one of the statutory grounds, the trial court moves to the second, or dispositional, stage, where it determines whether it is in the
                        best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights; so long as the court applies the different evidentiary standards at each of the two stages, there is no requirement that the stages be conducted at two separate hearings.

                        If a petitioner meets its burden of proving at least one ground for termination of parental rights exists under G.S. 7B-1111(a), then a trial court proceeds to the dispositional phase and determines whether termination of parental rights is in the best

                        Having adjudicated the father’s willful abandonment of the child, the trial court was obliged to determine whether it was in the child’s best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights, and to do so without regard to any competing interest of
                        him. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 263 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Because the trial court found that a mother proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that at least one ground to terminate the father’s parental rights existed — that the father willfully abandoned the children — the trial court was therefore
                        required to make dispositional findings about whether termination was in the children’s best interests. In re J.D.C.H., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 335</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 868, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 835 (2020).

                        In proceedings to terminate a mother’s parental rights, a trial court’s order concluding that termination was in the child’s best interests did not comply with G.S. 7B-1110(a) because the trial court did not make any written findings of fact regarding
                        the issues of whether termination would aid in the accomplishment of the permanent plan, G.S. 7B-1110(a)(3), and the quality of the bond between the child and the mother, G.S. 7B-1110(a)(4). In re J.L.H.,

                    <p>
                        Given the totality of the evidence and the trial court’s extensive order, the court clearly considered the factors in G.S. 7B-1110, and it was in the best interest of the juveniles that the parental rights of the parents be terminated. In re L.M.T.,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of parental rights was in a child’s best interests because the court considered: (1) the bond between the juvenile and the parent; and (2) the quality of the relationship between
                        the juvenile and the proposed adoptive parent. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 763 S.E.2d 314, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1001 (2014).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights because it made the requisite findings, and those findings revealed a reasoned decision; the trial court made findings, supported by competent evidence, concerning the
                        likelihood of adoption for the mother’s children concerning whether termination of the mother’s parental rights would aid in the accomplishment of the permanent plan of adoption, and concerning the bond between the mother and children.

                        Trial court’s written findings were sufficient to demonstrate its consideration of the parties’ evidence regarding the bond between the children and the mother under G.S. 7B-1110(a)(4) where once the children were placed with the kinship provider, the
                        mother did not visit the children, failed to maintain regular contact with them, and made no efforts to complete the goals of the Out of Home Family Services Agreement for either child. In re C.V.D.C.,

                        Mother’s contention that the trial court only nominally addressed the statutory factors was without merit; the trial court considered the factors along with the facts of the case, finding in part that one child did not have a bond with mother and actively
                        resisted having any contact with her, the other child did have bond with mother, and neither child was in a pre-adoptive placement and the department was trying to locate a foster home that would adopt both children together. In

                        Termination of a father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests because the child lived with his mother in a stable environment, he had a strong relationship with his grandparents, and the mother was committed to caring for the child and engaged
                        in his educational, social, and medical well-being. In re J.B., 2021-NCSC-135, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 233</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 285, 2021- NCSC-135, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1128 (2021).

                        Court properly found that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests because the state had contacted and assessed fourteen potential relative placements but found none to be acceptable, the trial court acknowledged
                        the maternal grandmother’s request that the children be placed with her but made findings explaining why such a placement would be inappropriate, and the court concluded that freeing the children for adoption would afford them
                        the greatest opportunity to be nurtured, loved, and cared for in a safe environment. In re N.C.E., 2021-NCSC-141, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 283</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 293, 2021- NCSC-141, 2021 N.C. LEXIS

                        Transcript demonstrated that the trial court did carefully consider each of the statutory criteria, and although the better practice would have been for the trial court to make written findings as to the factors, the failure to do so did not constitute
                        reversible error; there was no conflict regarding the likelihood of adoption, no bond existed between the father and the children, and because this was a private termination proceeding, there was no permanent plan for the children

                        As this case involved a private termination of parental rights initiated by the child’s mother, who had full custody of the child at the time, the likelihood of the child’s potential adoption was not a sufficiently relevant factor in determining whether
                        termination of the father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 262 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Since there was no conflicting evidence about either the likelihood of each child’s adoption if the mother’s rights were terminated or one child’s strong bond with his prospective adoptive parents, no written findings were required in this regard; as
                        no prospective permanent placement had been identified for the other two children, that factor did not apply. The trial court did not violate the statutory mandate as to its determination of the children’s best interests. In re

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed to obtain stable housing for at least six months
                        as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and she failed to complete the recommended treatment

                        which directly related to his case plan; there was no error in the trial court’s findings of fact regarding the father’s failures in accomplishing his case plan, most of which resulted from circumstances for which he was responsible.

                        District court’s findings supported the conclusion that the father’s parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father’s care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                        skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be in

                        evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan’s requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court’s findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the father’s

                        neglect, the mother’s failure to complete her case plan supported the conclusion that she willfully left her child in foster care or a placement outside the home for over 12 months without making reasonable progress in correcting
                        the circumstances that led to the removal of the child, and her failure to comply with substance abuse and mental health treatment and to address domestic violence issues sufficiently demonstrated her lack of reasonable progress.

                        to drug screens, and attending visitations, all of which reflected her inability to provide the juvenile proper care and supervision in a safe home environment, the juvenile had spent half of his life in Department of Social Services

                        Adoption social worker who supervised the majority of the mother’s visitations with the children testified that she did not see a bond, and the trial court was entitled to credit this testimony over any conflicting evidence; additionally, in light of
                        the trial court’s uncontested finding of fact that the mother was incapable of raising her children, the fact that two of the children might have expressed a preference to return home was noteworthy but not determinative. In re

                        During the adjudicatory phase of a termination of parental rights proceeding, a trial court does not consider whether there is a relative who can take custody of the minor child, but focuses on whether there is evidence to support termination on the grounds
                        alleged in the petition, and if a fit relative were to come forward and declare their desire to have custody of the child, the court may consider this during the dispositional phase as grounds for why it would not be in the child’s
                        best interests to terminate the parent’s parental rights. In re J.A.A., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 623 S.E.2d 45, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2706 (2005).

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper based on her willful failure to make reasonable progress because, inter alia, the mother voluntarily placed the children in the custody of the county department of social services so that the father
                        could live with her; and she failed to protect her children by allowing the father, who had assaulted her and two of the children, to return to the family home. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,

                        Where the trial court properly concluded that grounds for termination existed, as set forth in former G.S. 7A-289.32(7), the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate both parents’ parental

                        Termination of the parents’ rights was in the children’s best interests because adoption of each juvenile was likely; termination would aid in the permanent plan of adoption; the juveniles were bonded to their prospective foster parents; the foster parents
                        were providing for the juveniles’ special needs; the proposed adoptive parents had agreed to allow the juveniles to visit with each other on a regular basis; and other factors outweighed the parents’ strong bond with the eldest

                        The respondent mother offered “nothing” upon which the trial court could reasonably base a decision to find it would not be in the child’s best interests to terminate parental rights, where although she proffered evidence claiming she had overcome her
                        problems and achieved rehabilitation while in prison, enrolling in a cosmetology course there, frequently writing letters to her daughter, writing to petitioner and the court asking them not to terminate her parental rights, and
                        requesting visits with the child, she had been written up at least 11 times for disciplinary problems during her latest incarceration, including disobeying orders, misusing medicine, theft of property, possessing non-threatening

                        at the hands of her brother and her stepfather; (2) where the mother acknowledged awareness of the abuse, but did virtually nothing to protect the daughter from it; (3) where the mother lacked insight regarding her own significant
                        mental health issues; (4) where the mother played a significant role in creating a neglectful and abusive home environment for the daughter, and (5) where the mother had made minimal progress in correcting the issues that led to
                        removal of the daughter from the mother’s home. In re Dhermy, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 588 S.E.2d 555, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2181 (2003).

                        (2) the mother had left the child with others, including an incident initiating the child’s removal from her custody, (3) the mother had attempted suicide, had not cooperated with social workers, did not follow through with mental

                        considered the GAL’s step-son her big brother, and (6) the mother had been aware of the GAL’s intent to adopt the child for three years, yet her personal situation had not improved or stabilized. In re E.T.S.,

                        unsanitary condition of the family’s home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they were

                        the child had been in foster care, and the likelihood of his being adopted by the relative placement; the findings reflected that the child had been placed with a maternal aunt since birth, had never lived with the mother, and

                        Although the biological father argued that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it was in the best interest of the minor child to terminate the biological father’s parental rights because the biological father’s mother was willing to take
                        custody of the minor child and it was unclear whether the minor child’s foster parent would be able to adopt the minor child, the court found that nothing within G.S. 7B-1110 required that termination lead to adoption in order
                        for termination to be in a child’s best interests, and the biological father had not taken any actions in G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5) exhibiting a parental interest in the minor child, which provided grounds for termination of his parental
                        rights. In re M.M., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 684 S.E.2d 463, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1616 (2009).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining it was in the best interest of a child that the parental rights of the child’s parent were to be terminated because the court found that: (1) the child was eight years old; (2) adoption was very
                        likely as the child was living with a foster family that wanted to adopt the child as soon as legally possible; (3) termination of parental rights would accomplish the permanent plan of adoption; (4) although the child had a bond
                        with the parent, the child had indicated to the child’s therapist that the child did not wish to return to the parent’s custody; and (5) the child had bonded with the child’s foster family, which had been meeting the child’s needs
                        and providing the love and support expected of a family. In re D.J.E.L., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 701 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2072 (2010).

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that it was in the best interests of a father’s son to terminate the father’s parental rights, as the trial court’s findings of fact showed that the son lived with his mother and her current husband, that he had a
                        close relationship with his stepsister, that the mother and her husband were actively involved with the son’s extracurricular activity, that the mother and her husband had been the sole source of parental care for the child for
                        the past ten years, that the father had not been a part of the child’s school or extracurricular activities, that the child was well-adjusted, that the father was incarcerated for a crime of violence, and that the nine-year-old
                        child last saw the father when he was five years old. In re A.J.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 695 S.E.2d 156, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1139 (2010).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the best interests of the children because documentary evidence produced by the children’s guardian ad litem noted that with therapy, the children would
                        be able to be adopted; the trial court’s order did contain a finding addressing the children’s behavioral issues, and the trial court found that with continued therapeutic treatment, the likelihood of their adoption remained high.

                        Court did not err in deeming it likely that the grandparents would adopt the child, and it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the child’s best interests would be served by terminating the mother’s parental rights because the grandparents
                        did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child’s grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt him; by all accounts, the child
                        was thriving in the grandparents’ home; and the child’s guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother’s and the father’s parental rights in order to facilitate the child’s adoption by the grandparents. In re D.E.M.,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-1110(a) where although the grandparents did not have standing to petition to adopt the child, the trial court had not operated under a misapprehension
                        of the law given that they were her legal guardians and she was thriving in their home. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1032 (2017).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest, as, contrary to the mother’s assertion, the trial court did consider the mother’s progress toward sobriety but
                        noted that she had been incarcerated for all but a few days of the time and the trial court also considered the child’s bond with the mother and other relatives.

                        Trial court’s conclusion that termination of a father’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion where the trial court appropriately considered the factors stated in G.S. 7B-1110(a), and its determination
                        that other factors outweighed the father’s strong bond with the children was not manifestly unsupported by reason given their strong bond with their foster parents, the strong likelihood of adoption, and the father’s lack of progress
                        in addressing his substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental health. In re Z.L.W., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 432</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 62, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 792 (2019).

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the son’s best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                        permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>, 835 S.E.2d

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when determining that terminating the parents’ rights was in the juveniles’ best interests, finding that other factors outweighed the parents’ strong bond with the juveniles, including that termination was necessary
                        to achieve the primary permanent plan, the children were in a preadoptive home with their maternal grandparents, the children and the grandparents were well bonded, and the children would likely be adopted. In re Z.A.M.,

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it was in the children’s best interests to terminate a mother’s parental rights because the trial court thoroughly considered the children’s developmental challenges and their likelihood of adoption
                        based on the children’s then placement and potential future adoptive parents. Furthermore, there was testimony that the children were thriving and showing great improvement developmentally in their placements. In re J.H.,

                        Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights in his son because the son’s potential placement with a relative was not a factor it was required to consider or make findings about during the dispositional phase of the termination of parental
                        rights proceeding; the trial court determined that the child’s best interests would be served by remaining in the custody of the county department of health and human services rather than being placed with a relative. In re S.D.C.,

                        Trial court’s findings demonstrate that it considered the best interest factors and determined that the child’s young age, lack of any bond with the father, and need for consistency, combined with the father’s lack of involvement with the child, supported
                        a finding that termination was in the child’s best interests. In re C.J.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 42</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 742, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 262 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of the father’s rights was in the child’s best interests; given his abandonment of the child for several years before the mother filed her petition, the father’s conduct indicated he would not promote the child’s physical and emotional well-being,
                        plus the child considered the mother’s husband as her only father. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 263 (2020).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the child’s best interests would be served by terminating the father’s parental rights because it found that the stepfather wished to adopt the child, the child indicated he wanted to be adopted
                        by the stepfather, the child had very little recollection of his father, the father had a lengthy history of assaultive behavior against the mother, and he had been involved in criminal activity for the majority of the child’s
                        life. In re J.T.C., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 847 S.E.2d 452, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 610 (2020), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 642</cite>, 853 S.E.2d

                        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests where a finding of high likelihood of adoption was supported by the social worker’s testimony. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Contrary to the mother’s assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                        to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother’s parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,

                        Trial court’s conclusion that termination of the parents’ parental rights was in the children’s best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the court appropriately considered the statutory factors when determining the children’s best
                        interests and the court’s finding that the parents’ strong bond with the children was outweighed by other factors was not manifestly unsupported by reason. Trial court also found that the parents were not in a position to provide
                        adequate care for the children who were in preadoptive placement. In re J.J.B., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 787</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 1, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 627 (2020).

                        Trial court’s conclusion that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests did not constitute an abuse of discretion because it properly considered the statutory factors; the trial court found that the conduct of the mother
                        and father demonstrated that they would not promote the child’s health, physical, and mental well-being and that the child was no closer to returning home than she was on the day she entered into the care of the department of social
                        services. In re N.G., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 891</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 16, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 625 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court’s decision that it was in a child’s best interests to terminate the mother’s parental rights was not an abuse of its discretion as a social worker testified that the bond between the mother and the child during supervised visitations was similar
                        to that of playmates, while the quality of the relationship between the child and the proposed adoptive parent was similar to that of parent and child. The court also did not relegate the decision of whether to terminate parental
                        rights to a decision between the mother and the foster parent. In re A.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 752</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 902, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 620 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Dispositional findings showed that the trial court considered all of the relevant G.S. 7B-1110(a) criteria and made a reasoned determination that termination of parental rights was in the children’s best interests given the parents’ failure to make progress
                        in addressing their ability to deal with the children’s needs, the children’s relative youth, the likelihood of adoption, and the children’s need for permanence after more than five years in state custody. In re I.N.C.,

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her child for neglect, willful failure to correct the conditions that led to the child’s removal from her home, failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the child’s care while the
                        child was in DSS custody, and as in the child’s best interest because the trial court made sufficient dispositional findings regarding the child’s bond with her maternal grandmother and half-brother in light of the evidence before
                        it, considered the relevant statutory criteria, and weighed the competing goals of preserving the child’s ties to her biological family and achieving permanence for the child through adoption. In re S.J.B.,

                            class="nc_code">375 N.C. 362</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 401, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 834 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of parental rights was appropriate because the trial court’s dispositional findings demonstrated that it considered the statutory criteria and made a reasoned determination that termination of a mother’s parental rights was in a child’s best
                        interests as the court made findings concerning the child’s age, the likelihood of adoption, whether termination would aid in accomplishing the permanent plan of adoption, and the mother’s bond with the child. The lack of a proposed
                        adoptive placement for the child was not a bar to termination. In re C.B., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 556</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 324, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1009 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Termination of mother’s rights was in the children’s best interests; adoptability of the children alone was not dispositive, they had been in foster care for 13 months, one child had no bond with mother, and while the other child did have a bond, other
                        factors outweighed this, and termination was necessary to achieve permanence. In re H.A.J., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 43</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 464, 2021- NCSC-26, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 282 (2021).

                    <p>
                        Trial court made findings regarding the children’s ages, the pending civil custody action, the children’s lack of a bond with father after his five and one-half year absence, the children’s close and loving relationship with their grandparents, who had
                        provided for all of the children’s needs, and the negative impact on the children from father’s sudden return into their lives; termination was in the children’s best interests. In re G.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 29</cite>,

                        Trial court appropriately exercised its discretion to weigh the statutory factors to properly conclude that it was in the best interests of a mother’s children to terminate the parental rights of the mother. While the court considered the bond between
                        the children and the mother, the court noted the mother had not provide healthy parental boundaries, the age of each child, and the safe and secure placement of the children with a caregiver who intended to adopt the children.

                        Trial court properly terminated the father’s parental rights because the trial court’s findings regarding past neglect and the likelihood of future neglect were sufficient to support its conclusion that grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental
                        rights on the basis of neglect, and it was in the juveniles’ best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights as all five children were residing in appropriate placements where they were bonded to their caretakers, the
                        likelihood the children would be adopted was extremely high, there was no bond between the children and the father, and termination of the father’s parental rights would help achieve the permanent plan of adoption for the minor
                        children. In re S.J., 2021-NCSC-157, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 478</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 446, 2021- NCSC-157, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1294 (2021).

                        After a finding of abuse, neglect, and dependency on the part of the mother, the trial court did not abuse the court’s discretion in determining that termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the best interests of the mother’s child because the
                        court reasonably determined that the mother and the child did not have a strong or healthy bond, that the child was in high need of stability and permanence, and that the child was in a pre-adoptive placement and had a good relationship
                        with the foster family. In re N.B., 2021-NCSC-154, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 441</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 427, 2021- NCSC-154, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1333 (2021).

                        Terminating the mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interest where the record contained ample support for the findings that she had little bond with the children, failed to address her mental health needs, and was unable to control her
                        emotions during visits. The evidence also showed that the children manifested negative behaviors after the visits. In re T.A.M., 2021-NCSC-77, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 611 (June 18, 2021).

                        of care at the earliest possible age. In re M.R.J., 2021-NCSC-112, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 648</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 639, 2021- NCSC-112, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 927 (2021).

                        children. Furthermore, the foster parents were open to keeping the children together and adopting both of the children if one of the children’s behavioral issues and need for medication were met and the foster parents were willing

                        Father’s claim that the amended version of G.S. 7B-1110 required a trial court to determine the “worthiness” of the grounds for termination found in the adjudication stage of the proceedings when making its discretionary decision in the dispositional

                        was in the child’s best interests; even if the trial court applied the wrong evidentiary standard, father did not show that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s failure to articulate the lower standard employed for the dispositional

                        in the various programs that the mother attended. In re C.M., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 644 S.E.2d 630, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1152 (2007).

                        In a case in which a mother argued on appeal that the factual findings made by a district court did not support the conclusion that termination of her parental rights was in the best interests of the juvenile, the district court’s uncontested findings
                        demonstrated that it properly considered the required factors listed in G.S. 7B-1110(a). The termination of her parental rights furthered the plan of adoption; the district court found that the juvenile was in need of a stable
                        and permanent environment and that terminating the mother’s parental rights was a step toward giving the juvenile a stable and permanent environment. In re S.T.P., <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite>                        468, 689 S.E.2d 223, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 281 (2010).

                        Findings fully supported the trial court’s conclusion that grounds existed to terminate a mother’s parental rights based upon her willful failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care during the children’s placement in county department of social
                        services custody because the mother was on notice of her failure to pay something towards the cost of care for her children; the trial court repeatedly found in its permanency planning orders that none of the parents were paying
                        child support. In re S.E., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 360</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 328, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 94 (2020).

                        The evidence supported a finding that termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child; while there were perceived improvements in respondent’s mental condition, the evidence tended to show that after almost two years of diligent efforts
                        by DSS, respondent was not able to demonstrate that she could adequately provide for her child’s needs, and testimony by one expert as to the negative effect of any further delay on a permanent placement of the child, given his
                        age and close bond to his foster family, was particularly persuasive. In re Brim, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 535 S.E.2d 367, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1028 (2000).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a father’s parental rights because grounds for termination existed under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5) where, in the three-and-a-half years since the mother told the father that she was pregnant and that he
                        was the father, and until the mother contacted him about child support, the father had expressed no interest in discovering whether the mother had given birth, in determining whether the child was his, or in taking responsibility
                        for the child. In re T.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 605 S.E.2d 249, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2165 (2004).

                    <p>
                        There were sufficient findings to support the termination of parental rights order, including the fact that the father failed to propose an alternate replacement to take care of the children, that the father failed to provide any contact, love, or affection
                        for the children, and that the father failed to attempt to contact the children while he was incarcerated. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 615 S.E.2d 26, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1268 (2005).

                        result of a reasoned decision guided by the clear best interests of these juveniles, as the evidence showed that, inter alia, the mother “thumped” the five-year-old in the face hard enough to leave a finger-shaped bruise, the stepfather
                        hit the younger child with a brush hard enough to leave a large bruise, respondents attempted to convince the younger child to lie, and the mother admitted that she left the younger child alone in the bathtub every night for 20

                        Trial court considered the testimony of the guardian ad litem and the therapist, determined their testimony was credible, and made an independent finding regarding the children’s bond with father based on that testimony, which was proper. In re G.G.M.,

                        Even assuming that this argument was preserved for appeal, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by curtailing father’s testimony; some of his concerns regarding the maternal grandfather were described in his testimony, plus the trial court had

                        to a speedy resolution of the termination of the parental rights petition; (2) the child was entitled to a permanent plan of care at the earliest possible age; (3) the trial court’s delay in entering the order delayed the father’s

                        from filing an appeal until seven months after the hearing; pending the appellate court’s determination of the appeal, the child remained in the department’s custody, and subsequent court proceedings involving the child were limited

                        Father was required to show prejudice from a trial court’s delay in filing its termination order, but his sole argument was that the five-month delay prejudiced him by the delay of his right to appeal and to achieve finality in the relationship with his

                            Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over a case involving termination of a mother’s parental rights to her son, and the trial court did not err in denying the mother’s motion to stay the termination proceeding pending resolution of her appeal
                            of a prior custody order, because case law established that the trial court retained jurisdiction to terminate parental rights during the pendency of the custody order appeal and, where a termination order is entered while
                            a prior custody order is pending, the termination order necessarily renders the pending appeal moot. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 1589 (2005).

                            Trial court had jurisdiction to terminate a mother’s parental rights because it had jurisdiction over the underlying neglect and dependency action and issued a valid custody order to the county department of social services, giving it standing to file
                            the petitions for termination of parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1103(a)(3); a summons was issued a day after the juvenile petitions were filed, and although the mother was not served with the summonses until after their
                            expiration, she made a general appearance in the action before the trial court at the non-secure custody hearings, thereby waiving any objection to personal jurisdiction.

                            Father failed to show that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights where it was undisputed that the child’s mother, the father, and the child no longer resided in Delaware when the county department of social
                            services (DSS) filed the juvenile petition, and initial information that the child did not reside in North Carolina was superseded by more accurate information that the child had resided in the state for more than six months
                            before DSS filed the juvenile petition. Thus, North Carolina was the child’s home state. In re L.T., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 567</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 199, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 508 (2020).

                            rights can occur; thus a determination that the department made diligent efforts to provide services to a parent is no longer a condition precedent to terminating parental rights. In re Frasher,

                            In North Carolina, grounds for termination of a parent’s parental rights must be supported by clear and convincing evidence, while a termination of parental rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. § 1912 (2002), requires evidence which
                            justifies termination beyond a reasonable doubt; to meet the federal requirement, the trial court must conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical
                            damages to the child. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 951, 563 S.E.2d 202, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 364 (2002).

                            In a department of social services petition to terminate a father’s parental rights, the trial court was only required, under G.S. 7B-1111(a) to find that one statutory ground for termination existed in order to proceed to the dispositional phase and
                            decide if termination was in the children’s best interests. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 112 (2003).

                        <p>
                            Proceeding for termination of parental rights requires the trial court to conduct a two part inquiry; G.S. 7B-1109(e) directs that the court first shall take evidence, find the facts, and shall adjudicate the existence or nonexistence of any of the circumstances
                            set forth in this section, which authorize the termination of parental rights of the respondent. Disposition is governed by G.S. 7B-1110, which provides in relevant part that upon a finding that any one or more of the conditions
                            authorizing a termination of the parental rights of a parent exist, the court shall issue an order terminating the parental rights of such parent unless the court shall further determine that the best interests of the juvenile
                            require that the parental rights of the parent not be terminated under subsection (a) of this section. In re Baker, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 581 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 1194 (2003).

                            Where the court merely recited the testimony of witnesses and did not make the required findings of fact, further findings of fact and a determination of the father’s parental fitness was needed if he was to be denied all contact with his daughter. Moore

                        <p>
                            Termination of parental rights proceeding is a two-stage process: the trial court first determines whether sufficient grounds exist under G.S. 7B-1111 to warrant termination; if the trial court determines that any one of the grounds for termination listed
                            in G.S. 7B-1111 exists, the trial court may then terminate parental rights consistent with the best interests of the child. In re T.D.P., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 595 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            Allowing the trial court to terminate the mother’s parental rights during the pendency of the custody review order appeal did not prejudice the mother’s rights, as the termination proceedings required that a ground for termination under G.S. 7B-1111 be
                            established and the proceedings afforded the mother an opportunity to challenge the termination order on appeal under G.S. 7B-1113. In re R.T.W., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 539</cite>, 614 S.E.2d

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was upheld because the unchallenged grounds for termination of the mother’s parental rights supported the trial court’s termination order.

                            Trial court’s order terminating a mother’s parental rights was proper based on findings that the older of the two children was abused and neglected, the younger child was neglected, the mother willfully abandoned the children for six consecutive months
                            preceding the filing of the petition, the mother left the children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing that reasonable progress had been made to correct the conditions that led to the children’s removal,
                            the children were dependent, and the mother committed and was convicted of a felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury to the older child.

                            G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) could not be used as a ground for terminating a mother’s parental rights because failure to make reasonable progress was not alleged in the termination petition.

                            Findings of fact, focusing on what occurred through early 2007, did not explain why the trial court reached its determination that the parents’ efforts in 2006 through April 2008—the date of the filing of the petition giving rise to the order on appeal—did
                            not amount to reasonable progress; while petitioner mother’s brother focused on evidence of domestic violence and alcohol consumption in 2008, the trial court made no findings of fact as to that evidence, but discussed incidents
                            that occurred in early 2006. Without findings as to the reasonableness, adequacy, or inadequacy of the 2006 through 2008 efforts, the court could not determine that the trial court’s conclusions were supported by its findings
                            of fact. In re F.G.J., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 684 S.E.2d 745, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1730 (2009).

                            Trial court’s conclusion that one statutory ground for termination existed was sufficient in and of itself to support termination of a father’s parental rights; as such, the supreme court did not need not to address the father’s arguments regarding another
                            ground for termination. In re O.W.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 645</cite>, 849 S.E.2d 824, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1018 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(4), and (7) because termination was in the child’s best interests since the father had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding
                            the filing of the mother’s termination petition, and the father willfully failed without justification to pay for the care, support, and education of the child as required by the child support order. In re J.I.T., 2021-NCSC-151,

                            Court did not err in adjudicating neglect as a ground for termination because the parents had not established a residence for the child, the father was unemployed, the parents had not been consistent with visitation, and the needs and problems that existed
                            at the initiation of the case still existed for the father. In re R.G.L., 2021-NCSC-155, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 452</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 401, 2021- NCSC-155, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1332 (2021).

                            would be a possible ground to support termination, and G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b) did not apply, the termination order was reversed.

                            foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their removal, under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), and (3) willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the

                            under N.C. R. App. P. 10, and, as only one ground had to be found to terminate parental rights, it was unnecessary to consider the mother’s appellate argument as to the ground she challenged. In re J.A.A.,

                            Pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), there was sufficient evidence to support the termination of a mother’s parental rights over her minor child, as the evidence indicated that she willfully left the child in placement outside of the home for more than 12

                            There was a sufficient basis in the record for terminating the father’s parental rights that had nothing to do with poverty; his failure to obtain custody appeared primarily to have been the result of his own inaction, and thus poverty could not have
                            been the sole reason for terminating his parental rights. In re A.W, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 765 S.E.2d 111, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1174 (2014).

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the findings of fact in the termination order relating to the prior determinations that the children were neglected juveniles, the mother’s failure to participate in court-ordered mental health

                            Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights because the mother was unable to protect the child from abuse or prevent him from engaging in risky behaviors, her untreated mental health condition made it emotionally unsafe for her to interact
                            with the child, she had not gained insight into the child’s sexual- or physical-abuse-related trauma or how to properly care for it, she had not procured a safe or stable home for the child to live in, and her parental rights

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was supported by evidence showing a pattern of neglect that was likely to be repeated if the children were returned to the mother’s care, including exposure to men with histories of child sexual abuse, evidence
                            of the mother’s cognitive limitations which led to concerns about her abilities to protect the children from future abuse, and evidence that the mother expressed doubt that the children were abused and failed to acknowledge

                            grounds to terminate parental rights be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a dual burden of proof was created in which the state provisions and federal provisions had to be satisfied separately; i.e., the state grounds
                            for termination had to be supported by clear and convincing evidence, while the federal law required evidence which justified termination beyond a reasonable doubt.

                            Trial court’s corrected order terminating a mother’s parental rights was vacated because the trial court was without jurisdiction pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(a) to add an omitted finding of fact, which was substantive, when the presence
                            or absence of the finding of fact that the mother lacked an appropriate alternative child care arrangement altered the effect of the order; when, the trial court relies upon a single ground to terminate parental rights, the

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights was supported by evidence which showed that the father’s history of domestic violence toward the child’s mother led to the child’s removal, that the father agreed to participation in a domestic violence program

                            Trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for a mother in an action to terminate her parental rights; under the version of G.S. 7B-1101 in effect when the petition was filed, a guardian was required where it was alleged that the mother
                            was physically disabled pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6). In re D.S.C., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 607 S.E.2d 43, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 172 (2005).

                            the mother’s mental health issues, involving, in part, bipolar disorder, were central to the termination. In re L.W., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 623 S.E.2d 626, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 55 (2006).

                            terminating her parental rights. Accordingly, the mother was entitled to a new termination hearing and the appointment of a guardian ad litem.

                            whether the trial court should have appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother in a prior dependency proceeding was not an issue before the court on the appeal of the termination of the mother’s parental rights. In re O.C.,

                            in making that determination; therefore, G.S. 7B-1101 required appointment of a guardian ad litem for the mother, and the failure of the trial court to do so was error.

                            the trial court made an independent determination regarding the evidence presented. In re T.N.H., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 403</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 54, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 788 (2019).

                            The “for more than 12 months” requirement in G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) means the duration of time beginning when the child was “left” in foster care or placement outside the home pursuant to a court order, and ending when the motion or petition for termination

                            care, who is not provided necessary remedial care, who lives in an environment injurious to the juvenile’s welfare, who has been placed for care or adoption in violation of law, G.S. 7B-101(15). In re Yocum,

                            Father could not contend that certain issues did not lead to the juvenile’s adjudication as neglected because he stipulated to the findings of fact and consented to the child’s adjudication as a neglected juvenile; therefore, one finding of fact, which
                            was stipulated to by the father in the adjudication order, supported another finding of fact in the order terminating the father’s parental rights in the child. In re O.W.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 645</cite>,

                            evidence because although the direct issues that led to the adjudication of neglect primarily related to the mother, the trial court was permitted to consider indirect issues which contributed to the child’s neglect and removal.

                            with their abusers; accordingly, if returned to her care, the children would remain at risk of physical and sexual abuse, have unmet physical needs, and never heal from the trauma they had already endured. In re M.J.B.,

                            a homeless shelter, and after her incarceration for drug violations, she had failed to make proper arrangements for the children’s care. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 349</cite>, 856

                            after her entry into state custody; as a result, the record adequately supported the trial court’s finding concerning the inconsistency of the father’s contacts. In re N.B., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 349</cite>,

                            Father’s parental rights were properly terminated under G.S. 7B-1111 because he failed to show interest in the child’s welfare, the prohibition against contact with the child did not forbid him from seeking information about the child’s welfare, but he
                            failed to even attempt to find a way to learn about the child’s wellbeing. In re J.B., 2021-NCSC-135, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 233</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 285, 2021- NCSC-135, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1128

                            by a risk of future neglect, as shown by the terms of G.S. 7A-544 [see now G.S. 7B-302]. Under that statute, the Department may obtain temporary custody of a child where there is a risk of neglect by the parent or guardian.
                            This supports the position that the legislature was aware of the problem of future harm, and simply did not choose to make risk of neglect a ground for termination of parental rights. In re Phifer,

                            Evidence of neglect by a parent prior to losing custody of a child, including an adjudication of such neglect, is admissible in subsequent proceedings to terminate parental rights. The trial court must also consider any evidence of changed conditions,
                            in light of the evidence of prior neglect and the probability of a repetition of neglect. The determinative factors must be the best interests of the child and the fitness of the parent to care for the child at the time of
                            the termination proceeding. In re Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 708</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 227, 1984 N.C. LEXIS 1761 (1984).

                            Where termination of parental rights is sought upon allegations of neglect, the court may consider evidence of neglect occurring before custody has been taken from the parents, but termination may not be based solely on conditions of neglect which may
                            have previously existed but no longer exist. The court must also consider evidence of any change in condition up to the time of the hearing, but this evidence is to be considered in light of the evidence of prior neglect and

                            In a case involving the termination of parental rights on the ground of neglect, the court may consider a prior adjudication of neglect. It must also review the parents’ mental condition and evidence of changed conditions up to the time of the hearing,
                            in light of the evidence of prior neglect, to determine the probability of repetition of neglect. It is not essential, however, that there be evidence of culpable neglect following the initial adjudication. In re Caldwell,

                            Since the time the petition to terminate the father’s rights was filed, the father was released from incarceration, had obtained full-time employment, had family medical insurance available through the father’s employer, and

                            evidence that could support, although not compel, a finding of neglect, but without further fact-finding, the court of appeals could not determine whether the trial court’s conclusions were supported by its findings. In re

                            Findings were insufficient to support a determination that the father had neglected his child because the father’s incarceration alone could not serve as clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of neglect, the order did not establish that the father failed
                            to comply with the domestic violence-related portions of his case plan or engaged in continued acts of domestic violence, trial court’s finding that the father had submitted three diluted drug screens was insufficient to support
                            a determination as to the likelihood of future neglect, and the trial court’s finding that the father had not provided financially for the child, along with its determination that the father received SSI benefits and was not
                            required to pay child support, did not support its finding of neglect. In re K.N., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 274</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 861, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 33 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly concluded that neglect was likely to reoccur if the children were returned to the mother’s care where the findings of fact showed that she had been unable to recognize and break patterns of abuse that had put her children at risk
                            and that she failed to acknowledge her responsibility for the events leading to her children’s removal from the home. In re D.W.P., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 327</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 396, 2020

                        <p>
                            In a TPR action, the trial court’s findings supporting termination of the father’s rights based on neglect clearly showed that the trial court evaluated his history of alcohol abuse and behavior over the 22-month period during which the juveniles were
                            outside the house, which included a repeated pattern of returning to alcohol and evasion of numerous breathalyzer tests, admission to relapsing several times during outpatient treatment, and failing breathalyzer tests before
                            and after completing outpatient treatment. In re Z.A.M., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 88</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 792, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 266 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ground of neglect for termination of a father’s parental rights existed because the father was convicted for sexually abusing children and denied responsibility for those convictions, had persistent and serious mental health issues that affected the father’s
                            ability to parent the child, and lacked stable housing until shortly before the termination hearing. Furthermore, the district court found that there was a high probability that a repetition of neglect would have occurred in
                            the future if the child were to have been placed with the father. In re N.P., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 61</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 801, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 259 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights based on neglect as there was no requirement that he be responsible for the prior adjudication of neglect, he made minimal efforts to show interest in the child while incarcerated, and the record
                            evidence showed that the father was responsible for his failure to satisfy his case plan’s requirements. Moreover, the evidence supported the trial court’s findings that the child was likely to be neglected if returned to the
                            father’s care, the father was responsible for the lack of visitation, and his convictions and sentence were drug-related. In re S.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 67</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 315, 2020
                            N.C. LEXIS 275 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a father’s parental rights was appropriate because the trial court made sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion that grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental rights on the basis that neglect of the child would occur
                            if the child was returned to the father’s care given the father’s substance abuse and alcohol use issues, domestic violence concerns, and continuing to live with the mother despite her substance abuse issues and the domestic
                            discord in the home. In re J.O.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 797</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 570, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 624 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In light of the lengthy history of domestic violence between the parents, the trial court did not err by determining that the father’s limited attendance at and his failure to complete a program constituted a failure to fully engage in domestic violence
                            treatment and a lack of reasonable progress toward addressing the issue of domestic violence. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 916, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 623 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental rights based on neglect where although the father had made some progress toward completing his court-ordered case plan, his success was extremely limited and insufficient in light of the child’s placement
                            in state custody for over two years. In re J.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 772</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 44, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 628 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a father’s parental rights based on neglect was affirmed as the findings that he failed to adequately address domestic violence had ample evidentiary support and were, standing alone, sufficient to support a determination that there was
                            a likelihood of future neglect in the event that the children were returned to his care. In re M.A., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 865</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 916, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 623 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the extent certain determinations were more appropriately treated as conclusions of law, the court considers them as such, and there were sufficient findings of fact, supported by clear evidence, to support the trial court’s conclusion that grounds
                            existed to terminate respondent’s parental rights for neglect. In re M.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 882</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 564, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 626 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Assuming arguendo the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s finding about one incident between the mother and father, the remaining unchallenged findings established the mother’s continued engagement with the father when she was not supposed
                            to have any contact with him, and thus the erroneous finding was not necessary to support the legal determination that grounds existed for the termination of the mother’s parental rights on neglect grounds. In re M.C.,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">374 N.C. 882</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 564, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 626 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neglect was a proper ground to terminate the father’s parental rights; although he might have had no role in the mother’s substance abuse, the child’s removal from the mother was largely due to the fact that the child could not be placed with the father.
                            He failed to comply with the trial court’s order, he was not incarcerated until almost 12 months after he entered into his case plan and more than 12 months since he last visited the child, and he had not developed a relationship
                            with her and had not shown an ability to care for her. In re J.M.J.-J., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 553</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 94, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 502 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            District court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights for neglect and willful failure to make reasonable progress because the mother completed a parenting class, completed her substance abuse assessment, participated in individual therapy sessions
                            to address her mental health, re-engaged in treatment, was employed, submitted to drug testing, established more reliable communications with the Department of Social Services, obtained stable housing and transportation, and
                            showed reasonable progress to reduce or remove the likelihood of future neglect. In re C.N., <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 842 S.E.2d 627, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 328 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to the minor child and that it was in the child’s best interests that the mother’s parental rights be terminated because there was evidence in the record of past neglect and a probability of future
                            neglect, the mother’s failure to complete her case plan supported the conclusion that she willfully left her child in foster care or a placement outside the home for over 12 months without making reasonable progress in correcting
                            the circumstances that led to the removal of the child, and her failure to comply with substance abuse and mental health treatment and to address domestic violence issues sufficiently demonstrated her lack of reasonable progress.
                            In re Z.K., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 370</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 746, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 832 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her child for neglect, willful failure to correct the conditions that led to the child’s removal from her home, failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of the child’s care while the
                            child was in the Department of Social Services’ custody, and as in the child’s best interest because the trial court made sufficient dispositional findings regarding the child’s bond with her maternal grandmother and half-brother
                            in light of the evidence before it, considered the relevant statutory criteria, and weighed the competing goals of preserving the child’s ties to her biological family and achieving permanence for the child through adoption.
                            In re S.J.B., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 362</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 401, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 834 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A mother, by consistently providing gifts and repeatedly contacting the mother’s child and the child’s caregivers over a long period of time, showed the mother’s intent to remain a part of the child’s life. Therefore, the trial court’s findings of fact
                            affirmatively demonstrated that the mother did not neglect the child by abandonment, and consequently, reversal of the portion of the trial court’s termination order relying on the ground of neglect by abandonment was appropriate.
                            In re K.C.T., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 592</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 330, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1010 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings supported the conclusion that grounds existed under subsection (a)(1) to terminate a father’s parental rights because the trial court found there was a likelihood of future neglect based upon the father’s history; the trial court was within its
                            authority to determine the father’s minimal efforts during his incarceration did not outweigh the evidence of his failures to make improvements while not incarcerated and to conclude there was a probability of repetition of
                            neglect. In re O.W.D.A., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 645</cite>, 849 S.E.2d 824, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1018 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the fact that the father was incarcerated for 28 years, the termination of his parental rights based on neglect was supported by his history of incarceration for drug offenses, his lack of care and attention to the children when he was
                            not incarcerated, a history of domestic violence between the father and the mother that was witnessed by the children, his use of illicit substances while the children were in his care, and lack of progress in his case plan,
                            all of which were incorporated under the trial court’s finding of a likelihood of future neglect. In re J.S., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 73</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 487, 2021- NCSC-28, 2021 N.C. LEXIS
                            281 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother’s rights on the grounds of neglect was supported by substantial evidence; the trial court determined that mother’s last-minute progress was insufficient to outweigh her long-standing history of alcohol and substance abuse and
                            domestic violence, as well as the impact these behaviors had on the children, and it was not error for the trial court to find that there likely would be a repetition of neglect in the future should they be returned to mother’s
                            care. In re H.A.J., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 43</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 464, 2021- NCSC-26, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 282 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because certain findings of fact were nothing more than recitations of the testimony of various witnesses and did not meet the trial court’s obligation to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, the court disregarded these findings in determining whether
                            the trial court erred in holding that the mother’s rights were subject to termination on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858,
                            2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court was simply pointing to the portion of the record that provided the evidentiary support for one finding of fact and the court declined to disregard the essential import of this finding and another finding, that the mother tended to minimize
                            the nature and extent of the difficulties that she faced in attempting to parent the child. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the trial court received evidence in the form of oral witness testimony at the adjudication hearing, fully considered this evidence, and made findings delineating its independent evaluation of the record evidence in its adjudication order, mother’s
                            challenge to the trial court’s decision to take judicial notice of the record developed in the underlying neglect and dependency proceeding lacked merit. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>,
                            861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings of fact were supported by clear evidence and were relevant to the issue of whether mother’s parental rights were subject to termination on the basis of neglect, given that the findings demonstrated the continued existence of contact between mother
                            and father despite his abusive behavior, a fact that tended to show her failure to understand and to address the issue of domestic violence. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>,
                            861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the absence of any evidence tending to show what the continued existence of an opioid use disorder diagnosis reflected and what was necessary for this diagnosis to be deleted and the absence of any findings that mother had tested positive for drugs
                            or attempted to evade the required drug screening process, the court opted to refrain from considering this finding in determining whether the overall findings supported the conclusion that mother’s parental rights were subject
                            to termination on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As mother sought domestic violence counseling, the court disregarded the finding of fact stating no evidence was received in this regard, in connection with evaluating the lawfulness of the determination that mother’s parental rights were subject to termination
                            on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although mother pointed out that one doctor’s; report was the only evidence upon which certain findings could have rested, the report in question provided ample support for the challenged findings, with it being the province of the trial court to evaluate
                            the credibility of the evidence and determine the reasonableness of the inferences that should be drawn; court rejected this challenge to the lawfulness of the trial court’s order. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Careful review of the trial court’s adjudication order revealed that, rather than simply reciting the allegations set out in the termination motion, the trial court made sufficient additional findings of fact which indicated the trial court considered
                            the evidence presented at the hearing; the court rejected mother’s contention that the trial court erred by incorporating the allegations set out in the termination motion in its termination order. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91,
                            <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated the father’s parental rights because the trial court’s findings regarding past neglect and the likelihood of future neglect were sufficient to support its conclusion that grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental
                            rights on the basis of neglect, and it was in the juveniles’ best interests to terminate the father’s parental rights as all five children were residing in appropriate placements where they were bonded to their caretakers,
                            the likelihood the children would be adopted was extremely high, there was no bond between the children and the father, and termination of the father’s parental rights would help achieve the permanent plan of adoption for the
                            minor children. In re S.J., 2021-NCSC-157, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 478</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 446, 2021- NCSC-157, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1294 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court’s findings demonstrated that the father willfully withheld his love, care, and affection from the child during the relevant time period. The father’s conduct constituted willful abandonment, which terminated his parental rights under the statute.
                            In re L.M.M., 2021-NCSC-153, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 431</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 453, 2021- NCSC-153, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1329 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regardless of certain findings of fact being unsupported, remaining findings supported the conclusion that father’s rights were subject to termination based on neglect; there had been a prior adjudication of neglect and father did not appeal from that
                            order, he failed to consistently visit with the child, and he failed to complete his case plan, including addressing the issue of his substance abuse, from which the trial court properly found there was a high probability of
                            repetition of neglect. In the Matter of M.Y.P., 2021-NCSC-113, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 667</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 773, 2021- NCSC-113, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 932 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the trial court failed to make proper findings on adjudication, it erred in terminating a father’s parental rights based on willful abandonment; because the trial court only moved to the dispositional stage if it adjudicated one or more grounds
                            for termination during the adjudicatory stage, and there were different evidentiary standards and burdens in the two stages, its findings clearly labeled as dispositional did not support the adjudication of grounds to terminate
                            parental rights. In the Matter of K.J.E., 2021-NCSC-109, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 620</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 620, 2021- NCSC-109, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 936 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Determination that father’s parental rights were subject to termination on the basis of abandonment could not be upheld given the absence of any finding that his conduct was willful, plus the trial court made no findings of fact concerning his conduct
                            during the determinative six-month period specified in the statute. In re D.T.H., 2021-NCSC-106, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 576</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 651, 2021- NCSC-106, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 926 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though the trial court might have found that father willfully abandoned the child, the findings actually made failed to support a determination that father neglected the child by abandonment; trial court had to resolve a substantial factual dispute
                            over the extent to which father had contact with the child and the extent to which the limited relationship father had with the child stemmed from interference by the maternal grandparents rather than from father’s action or
                            inaction. In re D.T.H., 2021-NCSC-106, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 576</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 651, 2021- NCSC-106, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 926 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by terminating the father’s parental rights based on willful abandonment because it found that the father last saw the child in June 2012, he never attempted legal action to modify the permanent order to allow visitation, he did
                            not attempt to contact the child, he did not send the child a gift or card, and he never paid more than a third of his monthly child-support obligation. In re M.E.S., 2021-NCSC-140, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 275</cite>,
                            864 S.E.2d 351, 2021- NCSC-140, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1121 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights because while incarcerated, the father had a conduit to the minor child through the father’s grandmother but nevertheless failed to send money, gifts, cards, or letters to the minor child, upon
                            his release from prison, the father made no attempt to communicate with the child, and despite repeated statements that he intended to petition the courts for custody and visitation, the father failed to do so. In re C.K.I.,
                            2021-NCSC-131, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 207</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 323, 2021- NCSC-131, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1134 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Order terminating the father’s parental rights was affirmed because the father had not completed substance abuse treatment by the time of the termination hearing and he failed to show interest in the child’s welfare through the means available to him.
                            Thus, the trial court reasonably concluded that there was a high probability that the child would be neglected in the future were he placed in the father’s care. In re W.K., 2021-NCSC-146,
                            <cite

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Order terminating the parents’ parental rights in their daughter was affirmed because the parents had willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for their daughter despite having the physical and financial ability to do so and the
                            foster home in which the daughter resided was safe and appropriate. In re S.C.C., 2021-NCSC-144, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 303</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 521, 2021- NCSC-144, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1131 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because certain findings of fact were nothing more than recitations of the testimony of various witnesses and did not meet the trial court’s obligation to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, the court disregarded these findings in determining whether
                            the trial court erred in holding that the mother’s rights were subject to termination on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court was simply pointing to the portion of the record that provided the evidentiary support for one finding of fact and the court declined to disregard the essential import of this finding and another finding, that the mother tended to minimize
                            the nature and extent of the difficulties that she faced in attempting to parent the child. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the trial court received evidence in the form of oral witness testimony at the adjudication hearing, fully considered this evidence, and made findings delineating its independent evaluation of the record evidence in its adjudication order, mother’s
                            challenge to the trial court’s decision to take judicial notice of the record developed in the underlying neglect and dependency proceeding lacked merit. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>,
                            861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Findings of fact were supported by clear evidence and were relevant to the issue of whether mother’s parental rights were subject to termination on the basis of neglect, given that the findings demonstrated the continued existence of contact between mother
                            and father despite his abusive behavior, a fact that tended to show her failure to understand and to address the issue of domestic violence. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>,
                            861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the absence of any evidence tending to show what the continued existence of an opioid use disorder diagnosis reflected and what was necessary for this diagnosis to be deleted and the absence of any findings that mother had tested positive for drugs
                            or attempted to evade the required drug screening process, the court opted to refrain from considering this finding in determining whether the overall findings supported the conclusion that mother’s parental rights were subject
                            to termination on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As mother sought domestic violence counseling, the court disregarded the finding of fact stating no evidence was received in this regard, in connection with evaluating the lawfulness of the determination that mother’s parental rights were subject to termination
                            on the basis of neglect. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although mother pointed out that one doctor’s report was the only evidence upon which certain findings could have rested, the report in question provided ample support for the challenged findings, with it being the province of the trial court to evaluate
                            the credibility of the evidence and determine the reasonableness of the inferences that should be drawn; court rejected this challenge to the lawfulness of the trial court’s order. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91,

                            continued to harass her son’s caretakers, failed to demonstrate financial responsibility, could not focus properly on her son’s needs, missed scheduled visitations, and did not keep DSS informed of changes in her circumstances.

                            The court affirmed the termination of a mother’s parental rights for neglect where the trial court found that a prior adjudication of neglect was based on findings that the child “was starving to death” while in the mother’s custody and suffered from
                            “failure to thrive,” and that during supervised visitations with the child, the mother continued “to try and feed the [minor] child inappropriately both in the manner she tried to feed her and the food she brought to feed the
                            [minor] child.” In re Pope, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 547 S.E.2d 153, <cite class="nc_code">2001 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 320, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 359</cite>,

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights based on neglect where: (1) the mother failed to maintain stable housing and was unemployed, (2) the mother failed to comply with a child support order, (3) the mother
                            had left the child with others, including an incident initiating the child’s removal from her custody, (4) the mother failed to provide proper medication for the child, (5) the mother had attempted suicide, had not cooperated

                            Termination order was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence based on the mother’s unfitness to have custody, and the overwhelming evidence of neglect, including improper supervision of her children, inappropriate discipline, and the severely
                            unsanitary condition of the family’s home due to the many different farm animals living therein, as well as a roach infestation. Further, given evidence of the significant positive progress that the children made since they
                            were taken from the mother’s custody, termination was in the children’s best interests. In re J.A.P., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 659 S.E.2d 14, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 716 (2008).

                        <p>
                            Sufficient evidence supported the termination of a mother’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111 on the basis of neglect because the mother failed to complete a substance abuse program and attended only 10 of 29 scheduled visits with the child and such
                            neglect was likely to continue since the mother was engaged in substance abuse, lacked employment, and failed to obtain stable housing. In re S.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 525,

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a trial court’s termination of a mother’s parental rights to her four-year-old child, based on neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1), because the mother failed to maintain stable employment and housing, had
                            continued dependence on others to meet her basic needs, and the trial court had discretion to consider evidence that the mother’s older child had been adjudicated a neglected child, pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(15); since the mother’s

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported a trial court’s termination of a mother’s parental rights to her nine-year-old child, based on neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1), because fifteen kilograms of cocaine, assault weapons, ammunition, and numerous
                            other items related to the packaging and sale of cocaine were discovered in the home where the child lived, the mother allowed the child to sleep on a mattress in a closet, and the mother failed to maintain stable housing and
                            employment; since the mother’s release from jail in April 2008, she had five jobs and eight residences. In re C.G.R., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 717 S.E.2d 50, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 2239 (2011).

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights based on the probability of repetition of neglect was supported by substantial evidence that showed that the father made no effort to visit his son in the five months prior to termination hearing, that the father
                            met with a parenting class instructor only once even though parenting classes were part of case plan, and that the father held only occasional part-time jobs.

                            Termination of parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1), based on a finding that parents’ children were neglected pursuant to G.S. 7B-101(15), was supported by evidence that the parents’ relationship involved aggression and violence, that neither had
                            learned to control their aggressive tendencies, that their conduct was harmful to the children, and that termination of parental rights was in the children’s best interests. In the Matter of T.J.C.,

                            Trial court did not err by terminating a mother’s parental rights to three children on grounds of neglect because there was evidence of prior neglect, the neglect was ongoing, a substantial probability existed the children would be neglected or abused
                            in the future, and the mother continued to associate with individuals who abused her or the children. In re D.A.H.-C., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 742 S.E.2d 836, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 616 (2013).

                            Termination of the father’s parental rights based on neglect was proper as the findings of fact supported the trial court’s conclusion of law that the father neglected the child at the time of the termination hearing and that there was a likelihood of
                            repetition of neglect given the severity of the mother and the father’s abuse of the child’s siblings; the father’s dishonesty with respect to his role in the abuse and his continued contact with the mother; and the father’s
                            continued lack of understanding of the danger that the mother posed to the child. In re M.P.M., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C.

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on neglect was proper; issues of inappropriate discipline and domestic violence remained, the mother had not secured her own housing, and the findings supported the conclusion that there was a high probability
                            of the repetition of neglect if the children were returned to the mother’s care. In re C.M.P., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 803 S.E.2d 853, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 614 (2017).

                            Trial court did not err in concluding that grounds existed under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) to terminate a father’s parental rights where, in addition to prior adjudication of neglect, the father had a long history of criminal activity and substance abuse, he
                            was aware of the mother’s substance abuse issues, and he failed to follow through consistently with recommendations and directives following his release, including decreasing visitation with the child. In re M.A.W.,

                        <p>
                            Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated on the basis of neglect given the trial court’s findings that she had not gained independent housing since the child was removed, she could not support herself, and she maintained contact with the child’s
                            abusive father. In re A.L.Z., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 808 S.E.2d 176, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1032 (2017).

                        <p>
                            There was competent evidence to support the findings that the child was a neglected juvenile and there was a likelihood of repeated neglect; the mother and father were incapable of parenting, they failed to demonstrate their ability to engage in safe
                            visitation multiple times, and they did not comply with their case plans. In re A.A.S., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 812 S.E.2d 875, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 260 (2018).

                            Father’s appeal of the termination of his parental rights was dismissed because his counsel filed a no-merit brief, the father’s pro se arguments were untimely and nothing more than unsupported allegations of error, and the court found that grounds for
                            termination existed and that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests. In re I.P., <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C.

                        <p>
                            District court’s findings supported the conclusion that the father’s parental rights were subject to termination as the child would likely be neglected again if the child were returned to the father’s care because the mother struggled with basic parenting
                            skills and relied on the father as a main support for parenting; the father was willing to leave the child alone in the care of the mother even though the mother was unfit for such accountability; the parents continued to be
                            in constant marital discord even while having supervised visits with the child; and the parents intended to remain together despite the aforementioned problems. In re Z.V.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 207</cite>,

                            Trial court did not err by determining there was a likelihood that the neglect the child had previously experienced would be repeated if he was returned to mother’s care and by concluding that her rights were subject to termination based on neglect; mother
                            minimized the severity of her parenting-related problems and the extent to which her parenting deficiencies contributed to the child’s removal from her care, plus mother had failed to show that the conditions that had led to
                            his removal had been remedied. In re A.C., 2021-NCSC-91, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 377</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 858, 2021- NCSC-91, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 850 (2021).

                            Trial court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights to her child based on neglect and dependency because she failed to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by any alleged deficiency by her counsel’s performance or that there was a reasonable probability
                            of a different result, and she failed to challenge on appeal the trial court’s findings of fact or conclusions of law that the grounds for termination existed or that the termination was in the child’s best interest. In re

                            Trial court’s findings of fact supported its conclusion that a ground existed to terminate the mother’s parental rights due to neglect because the findings of fact demonstrated the mother’s lack of progress in obtaining appropriate housing, submitting
                            to drug screens, and attending visitations, all of which reflected her inability to provide the juvenile proper care and supervision in a safe home environment, the juvenile had spent half of his life in Department of Social
                            Services custody, and the mother’s prior neglect of the juvenile and her circumstances at the time of the termination hearing supported the trial court’s conclusion that the juvenile faced a significant likelihood of future
                            neglect if returned to the mother’s care. In re A.L.A., 2021-NCSC-148, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 383</cite>, 866 S.E.2d 733, 2021- NCSC-148, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1323 (2021).

                            Trial court did not err by determining that the parental rights of the mother and the father in their four children were subject to termination on the basis of neglect because they exhibited a failure to understand the need to keep the home and the juveniles
                            clean, and keep themselves clean, they denied that the children had special needs, they did not believe that the family had any problems that needed to be addressed and the mother lacked the ability to create an appropriate
                            environment for the children and the children were not safe in her exclusive care. In re A.E., 2021-NCSC-130, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 177</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 487, 2021- NCSC-130, 2021 N.C.

                            Evidence, including mother’s refusal to enroll in a residential drug treatment facility and her failure to make improvements in her lifestyle which might help her care for and supervise her children in view of her alcohol dependence, supported a finding

                            the mother had wilfully refused to perform her obligations as a parent, had withheld her presence, love, care, and opportunity to display filial affection from the child, and failed to financially contribute to the support

                            support the child, communicate with the child, and visit with the child but a few times and it was in the child’s best interest to terminate the father’s parental rights so that the mother could put the child up for adoption

                            to convey love or affection for the child, nor had he inquired about the child in his infrequent correspondence with the child’s mother, sufficiently supported the trial court’s findings that the father neglected the child

                            whether those findings were also sufficient for termination of the father’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7), based on willful abandonment.

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence existed to support termination of a mother’s parental rights for neglect where: (1) her daughter was sexually abused in the mother’s home under conditions the mother helped to create; (2) the mother was aware of
                            the sexual abuse, but failed to protect her child; (3) the mother did not continue therapy for the child after repeated sexual abuse, and (4) termination was in the best interest of the child because there was a strong likelihood
                            that the neglect would continue where the mother denied and/or minimized her responsibility for the abuse and neglect, and where she failed to minimize the conditions in her life that led to the child’s abuse and neglect. In

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111; the mother failed to comply with drug treatment and other requirements, and showed little interest in maintaining a relationship
                            with the daughter, as evidenced by the mother’s failure to pay to support the child and her failure to consistently visit the child, and therefore the trial court properly determined that the child was neglected. In re Howell,

                            Order terminating mother’s parental rights to her four minor children was proper where the children were previously adjudicated neglected, there was a probability of repetition of neglect if returned to the mother, four to five trial placements with the
                            mother had failed, the mother had a history of failing to show a positive response to counseling and educational programs, the mother left a stable job and housing to move to another state where she did not have employment
                            or independent housing, and she had been unable to cope with the pressure of caring for the children at the same time, with such findings being sufficient to establish neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1). In re L.O.K.,

                            a required parenting program, failed to attend individual counseling, and failed to address her substance abuse issues, the evidence supported the conclusion that the children were neglected under G.S. 7B-101. In re D.B.,

                            a sex offender to live with the mother, thereby supporting the finding of neglect. In re S.D.J., <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 665 S.E.2d 818, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 1617 (2008).

                            neglected if the mother regained custody; mother had failed to maintain a stable residence, was often in arrears on rent, and since August 31, 2006, there had been seven summary ejectment actions filed against the mother. In

                            Trial court did not err in terminating a father’s parental rights to two children for neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) and G.S. 7B-101(15), despite the progress the father made in a rehabilitation program during his incarceration. The father had exhibited
                            a pattern of recovery and relapse regarding his addiction to crack-cocaine and marijuana, and the trial court properly considered that his success at rehabilitation while incarcerated was not indicative of how he would deal
                            with his addiction once released. In re J.H.K., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 715 S.E.2d 563, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1898 (2011).

                            Because the evidence supported the trial court’s findings that a child’s father indicated an unwillingness to enter into a family services agreement, had never met with the child, and had no bond with the child, there was evidence to support the trial
                            court’s conclusion that the child was neglected by the father. Thus, there was evidence to terminate the father’s parental rights on this statutory ground. In re C.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite>                            75, 781 S.E.2d 680, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C.

                        <p>
                            Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper on the ground of neglect because he failed to appreciably address his substance abuse issues; he had only shown an extended abstinence from cocaine use while incarcerated; he did not complete substance
                            abuse treatment; he incurred serious felony charges during the pendency of the case and was convicted of discharging a firearm into occupied property; during his incarceration, he made no attempt to contact the child and had
                            limited contact with the Department of Social Services; and he could not use his incarceration as a shield against a conclusion that there was a probability of future neglect. In re A.S.T.,

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights on ground of neglect and abandonment was appropriate because the father did not comply with the father’s case plan in that the father had positive drug screens, failed to engage in recommended substance abuse
                            treatment, and was inconsistent with visitation of the father’s children. Furthermore, when the father did attend visitation the father appeared to be under the influence of substances. In re X.P.W.,

                            Trial court properly determined that a mother neglected the mother’s children because the court reasonably inferred that the children were subjected to the risks of physical and emotional harm and that the mother’s drug use, failure to maintain a safe
                            and stable home, and failure to assure the children received necessary care and supervision created an environment injurious to their welfare. Furthermore, the mothers’ failure to make progress in completing a case plan was
                            indicative of a likelihood of future neglect. In re K.B., 2021-NCSC-108, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 601</cite>, 862 S.E.2d 663, 2021- NCSC-108, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 925 (2021).

                            make any adjudicatory findings concerning the father’s alleged failings; the trial court found no other grounds existed upon which to base termination of the father’s parental rights. In re J.D.A.D.,

                            Termination of respondent’s parental rights was not supported by the evidence where none of the witnesses—the respondent’s guardian ad litem, her counselor, and a court appointed clinical psychologist— expressed certainty that her mental illness would
                            prevent her from adequately parenting her children and where the father of one of the children, whom the trial court seemed to have viewed as a threat, had since died.

                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, there was no clear, cogent, or convincing evidence and no finding that a father had neglected his children or that any past neglect was likely to reoccur and the trial court had to consider how conditions
                            had changed from the time it previously found the children were neglected; the father who had been in prison when those previous orders were entered was now out of prison, was no longer involved with the children’s mother,
                            who had neglected them, and was able and willing to care for his children. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 112 (2003).

                            plan was adopted, there had not been an adequate time to assess his progress on that case plan. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 112 (2003).

                            Because the trial court’s findings did not support the conclusion that the mother failed to make reasonable progress in correcting the conditions that led to a finding of neglect and the child’s removal, the mother’s rights were improperly terminated.

                            were the mother’s dwelling, and this fact, along with the fact that the mother did not attend the hearing or respond in any way, refuted the presumption of valid service under G.S. 1A-1-4(j)(2). In re K.N.,

                            testimony, which refuted DSS’s allegations, was not sufficient to carry its burden of proving the allegations of the termination petition by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence; the trial court failed to make an independent
                            determination of whether neglect authorizing the termination of parental rights existed at the time of the hearing because no oral testimony was provided on behalf of DSS, and the testimony the mother presented did not provide

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights based in part on his failure to pay support was supported by findings that the father made no child support payments after the child placed in the custody of a county department of social services, that the father
                            had been gainfully employed from time to time, and that the had been physically and financially able to make some payment but had not done so.

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper as she was working at a restaurant at the beginning of the six-month period but quit on her own accord, and any fault for the lapse in her medication was hers, as she chose to not seek another provider
                            until her symptoms worsened to the point that she needed to be hospitalized; the trial court’s findings established that the mother had the ability to pay some amount toward the cost of care for her children but paid nothing.

                            of law where, while the parents had a constitutionally protected interest in preserving familial bonds, they acted inconsistently with that interest, parental unfitness had been established, and the trial court would be proceeding

                            or poverty; the parents’ economic status is merely a factor used to determine their ability to pay such costs, but their ability to pay is the controlling characteristic of what is a reasonable amount for them to pay. In re

                            presented to the trial court on this subject established that she had been employed at various times since 1999 and did not address whether she was employed during the six months preceding the filing of the termination petition
                            or whether she had the financial ability to contribute to the children’s support during that time. In re Faircloth, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 588 S.E.2d 561, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 2179 (2003).

                            effect was admitted at the termination hearing or attached to or referenced in the verified petition. In re S.C.L.R., 2021-NCSC-101, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 484</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 834, 2021-

                            petition, willfully failed to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of care for the child although able to do so; this ground for termination was reversed. In re Z.G.J. (Aug. 27, 2021).

                            Abandonment imports any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Abandonment has also been defined as willful neglect and refusal
                            to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support. It has been held that if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, the opportunity to display filial affection, and willfully neglects to
                            lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child. In re APA, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 296 S.E.2d 811, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 3123 (1982).

                            Prior to October 1, 1985, two procedures were available to enable a petitioning party to adopt a minor child without the consent of the opposing biological parent. First, under this section, a court could terminate the parental rights of a biological
                            parent upon a finding of one of the grounds enumerated therein, and then pursuant to G.S. 48-5, once a district court had entered an order terminating the parental rights of the biological parent, that parent was no longer
                            a necessary party to an adoption proceeding. Second, the court, under G.S. 48-5(d), upon proper motion, was authorized to hold a hearing to determine whether an abandonment as defined in former G.S. 48-2(1)a and (1)b had taken
                            place. However, effective October 1, 1985, these proceedings were merged into one termination of parental rights proceeding under subdivision (8) of former G.S. 7A-289.32 (see now this section) to ascertain whether the parent
                            had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d 511,

                            that the court was proceeding under the relevant statutory provision, and that the other parent proved that the parent had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of
                            the petition. In re O.J.R., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 769 S.E.2d 631, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 78 (2015).

                            Trial court erred in terminating parental rights because the termination order did not contain the necessary findings of fact to support the conclusion that the parents willfully left the child in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct
                            the conditions which led to the removal of their child; the parents sought transportation assistance from the county department of social services but were denied help, and they both testified they had been regularly applying

                            Supreme court was unable to undertake meaningful appellate review of the trial court’s decision to deny a mother’s petition to terminate a father’s parental rights based upon a series of evidentiary findings that were untethered to any ultimate facts
                            or to any particularized conclusions of law that would explain the trial court’s reasoning; the trial court’s findings offered no assessment regarding the willfulness of the father’s conduct toward the child on the matter of
                            abandonment. In re K.R.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 849</cite>, 845 S.E.2d 56, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 629 (2020).

                            In a termination of parental rights action, evidence showed that the mother was in possession of her cousin’s phone number and had other shared relatives in through whom the mother could have attempted to communicate with the child, who was in the cousin’s
                            care, including the mother’s own mother as well as the cousin’s mother and grandmother. The mother’s complete failure to show any interest in the child for more than the six months required supported the trial court’s conclusion
                            that the mother acted willfully in abandoning the child. In re L.M.M., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 346</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 770, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 838 (2020).

                            Although a trial court’s findings failed to show that a mother — who had mental health issues, lacked a driver’s license, and was unemployed and relied on supplemental security income — had a purposeful, deliberative and manifest willful determination
                            to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the mother’s child, in light of the minimal contact between the mother and the child during the relevant six-month period, remand was appropriate for the court
                            to address the issue of whether willful abandonment existed. In re K.C.T., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 592</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 330, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1010 (2020).

                            Trial court properly terminated father’s parental rights for willful abandonment; findings established that father made no attempt to contact the children from late December 2013 through June 2019, he did not purchase clothing or other items for the children,
                            and he did not provide any financial assistance for the children’s benefit. Trial court did acknowledge that father had been injured in an unsolved shooting but ultimately determined that his failure to contact the children
                            was willful. In re G.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 29</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 478, 2021- NCSC-25, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 272 (2021).

                            There was no support for the trial court’s finding that father willfully “withheld his presence, love, care and affection from the children” during six consecutive months immediately preceding petition to terminate parental rights, where during this time
                            he visited the children during the Christmas holiday, attended three of the children’s soccer games and told the mother that he wanted to pay his back child support and set up regular visitations. Bost v. Van Nortwick,

                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court’s findings were not sufficient to support its conclusion that a father willfully abandoned his child for six months, under G.S. 7B-1111(7), because during the six months before the termination
                            petition was filed the father was incarcerated. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 112 (2003).

                            Termination of the natural father’s parental rights based on willful abandonment was reversed where the evidence showed that the father was instructed not to contact child during pendency of criminal charges against him for first degree sexual assault
                            involving a minor child — charges which were later dismissed, and that the father made child support payments when he had the money to do so.

                            Abandonment was not a proper basis for termination of the father’s parental rights where the Department of Social Services failed to allege abandonment as a ground for termination in its petition, and thus the father had no notice that abandonment was
                            going to be an issue during the termination hearing. In re C.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 641 S.E.2d 725, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 596 (2007).

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7) on the ground that she willfully abandoned her child for the six-month period prior to the filing of the termination petition because the mother’s actions during
                            the six-month period did not demonstrate a purposeful, deliberative, and manifest willful determination to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child; the mother visited the child eleven times
                            during the relevant time period and brought appropriate toys and clothes for the child to those visits, and many of the findings of fact the trial court made for the relevant period were not of great relevance for a determination
                            of willful abandonment pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7). In re S.R.G., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 671 S.E.2d 47, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 52 (2009).

                            Judicial determination that a parent willfully abandoned her child, particularly when a court is considering a relatively short six month period, needs to show more than a failure of the parent to live up to her obligations as a parent in an appropriate
                            fashion because the General Assembly did not intend the same factors relevant to termination pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), which requires a twelve month period before filing a termination petition on that ground, to be used
                            as substantive evidence in finding willful abandonment under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7); the findings must clearly show that the parent’s actions are wholly inconsistent with a desire to maintain custody of the child, and a parent’s
                            failure to address the necessary requirements laid out in his or her case plan to regain custody of her child becomes more relevant to any finding of willful abandonment the longer the parent fails to act. In re S.R.G.,

                            There was not sufficient competent evidence to terminate the mother’s parental rights based upon abandonment, as the mother paid child support, maintained regular contact with the children’s GAL, apparent sobriety, steady employment, and at least minimal
                            participation in the proceedings. In re A.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 773 S.E.2d 123, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 520 (2015).

                            District court’s finding of willful abandonment was not supported by the evidence where the father had entered into a case plan and substantially complied with it, he was current in his child support obligation, regularly visited the child, attended parenting
                            classes, and participated in the child’s medical appointments. In re D.T.N.A., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 582, 801 S.E.2d 642, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1372

                            Terminating a father’s parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as the father sought the children’s custody
                            during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children’s custody to others, terminating the father’s child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and purporting to waive any objection
                            to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order’s terms did
                            not meet statutory requirements for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C.

                            Explanation that the father had long planned to relocate to California with the child, based on his belief that he would be able to take the child with him or place her with his sister, did not inherently suggest a willful intent to abandon. In re E.B.,

                            In a termination of parental rights action, the mother’s actions did not rise to the level of willful abandonment, considering her two visits, her attempts to schedule additional visits, and her filing of a motion to increase her visitation, all of which
                            occurred during the relevant time period before the petition for termination was filed. In re B.R.L., 2021-NCSC-119, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 15</cite>, 863 S.E.2d 763, 2021- NCSC-119, 2021

                            to or during the relevant six-month period, the father testified that he wrote the child multiple letters while in prison, but that the mother refused to provide him with contact information for herself or the child, the trial
                            court’s findings did not address, in light of his incarceration, what other efforts the father could have been expected to make to contact the mother and the child, and the trial court’s order improperly mixed its factual findings

                            required him to stay away from her home and workplace; and the child was only three years old and, any communication with, gifts to, or requests to visit her would have had to necessarily been directed to the mother. In re

                            Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence in the record supported the findings that the minor child was dependent as defined by G.S. 7B-101, the mother failed to show the ability to properly parent the minor child and attend to his special needs, and the
                            mother had not seen the minor child since January 2007 and had not given gifts or support or shown any love or affection for the child since she last saw him. The findings in turn supported the trial court’s conclusions that
                            the minor child was dependent and abandoned, both of which are statutory grounds for termination. In re J.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 681 S.E.2d 485, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 1374 (2009).

                            Evidence was sufficient to support termination of a father’s parental rights based on abandonment pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7), as he failed to attend meeting, have visitation with his children, or pay child support to provide for them. In re C.I.M.,

                            While the better practice would have been to specifically plead termination pursuant the section for abandonment, the petition sufficiently alleged facts to place the father on notice that his parental rights may be terminated on the basis that he abandoned
                            his child, as it alleged that the father’s lack of involvement with or regard for the minor child constituted neglect. In re T.J.F., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 750 S.E.2d 568,

                            Trial court did not err in concluding a parent had abandoned a juvenile because, during the relevant six-month period, the parent did not visit the juvenile, failed to pay child support in a timely and consistent manner, and failed to make a good faith
                            effort to maintain or reestablish a relationship with the juvenile. The parent’s last-minute child support payments and requests for visitation did not undermine the trial court’s conclusion that the parent had abandoned the
                            juvenile. In re C.J.H., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 772 S.E.2d 82, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 327 (2015).

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper based on willful abandonment of her child as the mother made no effort to contact the child and paid nothing toward his support during the six months immediately preceding the filing of the grandparents’
                            petition to terminate because, while her parental rights had been previously terminated, there was no evidence that the mother sought to stay the order while her appeal was pending, or otherwise requested visitation with the
                            child from the trial court or the grandparents; she was not prohibited from contacting and visiting the child; and she demonstrated almost no interest in the child since losing custody of him. In re D.E.M.,

                            District court properly terminated a mother’s parental rights after adjudicating the existence of abandonment because the law of the case doctrine did not apply where the district court made several unchallenged findings of fact about events occurring
                            after the filing of the first petition by withholding her presence, her love, her care and failing to take any opportunity to display maternal affection, and there was no finding of fact in the order on appeal regarding respondent’s
                            reasons for her continued failure to visit or contact the child in the six months prior to the filing of the new petition in 2016. In re K.C., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 812

                        <p>
                            Sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s determination that the father willfully abandoned his children, as he had no contact with them during the statutory time period, he made no effort to have any involvement with them for several years following
                            the temporary custody judgment, and the fact that he was incarcerated for most the six-month period was not material, as he was aware during his incarceration of his ability to seek relief from the trial court’s orders and
                            he did not do so. In re E.H.P., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 388</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 49, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 795 (2019).

                        <p>
                            Sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s termination of the father’s parental rights due to abandonment; the father had no contact with the child or her grandparents, who had custody of the child, for nearly one year prior to the filing of the
                            termination petition, and he had the ability to make at least some contact but chose not to. As the father had not challenged these findings, they were binding on appeal. Further, he failed to resume visitation, did not send
                            any letters to the child, and did not provide any financial support. In re C.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 16</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 692, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 909 (2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Abandonment grounds existed to terminate the father’s parental rights and the trial court properly determined that he willfully chose not to see the child; though the father was out of jail and aware he could exercise visitation rights, he did not visit
                            the child, and after being given a second chance, the father took no action because he had “so much going on at one time.” Additionally, he neither sent the child any gifts or cards nor inquired about his welfare. In re B.C.B.,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 32</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 748, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 267 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Trial court’s findings supported its adjudication of termination of the father’s parental rights for abandonment; from 2014 until the petition’s filing date, the father had no contact or communication of any kind with the child, provided her no financial
                            support, and never attended any of her medical appointments, educational functions, or extracurricular activities. These facts supported the ultimate findings that the father acted willfully and with an intention to forego
                            his parental responsibilities to the child. In re K.N.K., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 50</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 735, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 263 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Termination of a father’s parental rights on the ground of willful abandonment was appropriate because the trial court found that the father, who was incarcerated and subject to an order prohibiting the father from directly contacting the children, one
                            of whom the father had allegedly sexually abused, had, with one exception, not contacted the mother to ask permission to have contact with the children or to otherwise express any love, affection, or parental concern for them
                            during the statutorily prescribed six-month period. In re: A.G.D., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 317</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 238, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 364 (2020).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court properly adjudicated grounds for terminating the father’s parental rights based on willful abandonment because the evidence showed that he had the ability to contact the child’s mother directly about the child but made no effort to do so,
                            and he provided no financial support for the child despite having full-time employment throughout the relevant six-month period. In re J.T.C., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 847 S.E.2d
                            452, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 610 (2020), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 642</cite>, 853 S.E.2d 146, 2021- NCSC-3, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 56 (2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Willful abandonment under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7) was supported where the mother had made no effort to have contact with the child during the determinative six-month period or in the two years before that period, and her failure to attempt any form of contact
                            or communication gave rise to an inference that she acted willfully in abdicating her parental role, notwithstanding any personal animus between her and the caregivers. In re A.L.S., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 515</cite>,

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights to the father’s children on the ground of willful abandonment was appropriate because the father willfully withheld the father’s love, care, and affection from the children during the determinative six-month period.
                            Furthermore, the father’s one unsuccessful request to visit the children during the six-months immediately preceding the filing of the termination petition did not undermine the trial court’s ultimate finding and conclusion
                            that the father willfully abandoned the children. In re J.D.C.H., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 335</cite>, 847 S.E.2d 868, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 835 (2020).

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights on ground of neglect and abandonment was appropriate because the father did not comply with the father’s case plan in that the father had positive drug screens, failed to engage in recommended substance abuse
                            treatment, and was inconsistent with visitation of the father’s children. Furthermore, when the father did attend visitation the father appeared to be under the influence of substances. In re X.P.W.,

                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights based on abandonment because the biological mother informed him of her pregnancy approximately four months prior to the child’s birth, the father had no contact with the child, did not provide
                            any care or support for the child during the 15 months from the time the child was born until he was incarcerated, and while incarcerated, he waited nearly two months to sign the Department of Social Services case plan, and
                            could only verify that he completed one case plan item: a parenting class. In re A.J.P., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 516</cite>, 849 S.E.2d 839, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1011 (2020).

                            Termination of the father’s parental rights due to abandonment was supported by undisputed evidence that the father, at a minimum, possessed the ability to seek the child’s contact information from his relatives but declined to do so for a number of years
                            and, instead, the father withheld his love, care, and filial affection from the child, both in the statutorily relevant six-month period prior to the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights and in the years preceding
                            that time span. In re M.S.A., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 343</cite>, 856 S.E.2d 811, 2021- NCSC-52, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 400 (2021).

                            The trial court improperly concluded that respondent did not willfully abandon his child notwithstanding his problems with alcohol where he made two inquiries regarding his child in 1993 and 1994 and one feeble attempt, during the relevant six months,
                            at providing financial support by listing the child’s name as his dependent on a work release application such that child support payments could be deducted from his pay but listed the wrong last name for his child and the

                            Court did not err in deeming it likely that the grandparents would adopt the child, and it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the child’s best interests would be served by terminating the mother’s parental rights because the grandparents
                            did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child’s grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt him; by all accounts, the
                            child was thriving in the grandparents’ home; and the child’s guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother’s and the father’s parental rights in order to facilitate the child’s adoption by the grandparents. In

                            Department of Social Services failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that due to mental illness, mother was incapable of providing for the care and supervision of her children, where the only evidence offered by DSS to show that mother was mentally
                            incapable of caring for her children was the testimony of doctor who testified that the fact that someone carries a diagnosis of personality disorder does not mean that that person is incapable of raising children and that
                            mother’s pattern of behavior by itself did not mean that she was incapable of taking care of her children. In re Scott, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 760, 383 S.E.2d 690, <cite class="nc_code">1989 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 864 (1989).

                            probability that mother’s mental illness would so continue and where doctor testified that mother was currently experiencing her longest sustained period of improvement and that she had dealt with the stress of the hearing

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the child’s best interests as the record provided overwhelming evidence that the mother’s intentional actions created a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the child; evidence showed that the
                            mother had Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) and that during the two years prior to the child being removed, the mother subjected the child to 25 different emergency room visits, 60 office visits to pediatricians, 143 prescriptions,

                            Although a trial court found, inter alia, that a mother suffered from significant mental health issues, it terminated her parental rights pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) because she had neglected her daughter; however, because the mother’s mental instability
                            was so intertwined with a child’s neglect, the trial court erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother pursuant to G.S. 7B-1101 at a parental rights termination hearing. In re J.D.,

                            G.S. 7B-1101.1 requires that a guardian ad litem be appointed in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 17 to represent a parent, meaning that where an allegation is made that parental rights should be terminated, a trial court is
                            required to conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed to represent the parent, and an allegation under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6) serves as a triggering mechanism, alerting the trial court that
                            it should conduct a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem should be appointed; at the hearing, the trial court must determine whether the parents are incompetent within the meaning of G.S. 35A-1101, such that the
                            individual would be unable to aid in their defense at the termination of parental rights proceeding, and the trial court should always keep in mind that the appointment of a guardian ad litem will divest the parent of their
                            fundamental right to conduct his or her litigation according to their own judgment and inclination. In re J.A.A., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 66, 623 S.E.2d 45, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 2706 (2005).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the best interests of the children because documentary evidence produced by the children’s guardian ad litem noted that with therapy, the children would
                            be able to be adopted; the trial court’s order did contain a finding addressing the children’s behavioral issues, and the trial court found that with continued therapeutic treatment, the likelihood of their adoption remained

                            Because the trial court’s findings were based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of dependency, it properly terminated the mother’s parental rights; the mother’s longstanding mental health conditions and her repeated failures to follow recommendations
                            for treatment necessary to care for her children safely constituted clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to support the trial court’s findings of dependency.

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was in the son’s best interest as he had a strong bond with his current foster family and was forming a long-term attachment to them; he was receiving structure and stability from the foster family; he needed
                            permanence and continued therapy; and the mother was no longer participating in his therapy and had not called to inquire about his welfare. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,

                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights in his son because the son’s potential placement with a relative was not a factor it was required to consider or make findings about during the dispositional phase of the termination of parental
                            rights proceeding; the trial court determined that the child’s best interests would be served by remaining in the custody of the county department of health and human services rather than being placed with a relative. In re

                            Contrary to the mother’s assertion, leaving her sons in their current foster placements with periodic visitation by her was not working as a plan; this arrangement was not only contrary to the permanent plan established by the trial court, it also served
                            to deny the children the prospect of a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time as contemplated by the Juvenile Code. Termination of the mother’s parental rights was affirmed. In re J.S.,

                            Trial court’s order terminating a father’s parental rights in a child was affirmed because the issues identified by the father’s appellate counsel as potentially supporting an award of relief from the trial court’s termination order lacked merit; the
                            findings of fact had ample record support, and the trial court did not err in determining that the father’s parental rights in the child were subject to termination and that termination of his parental rights would be in the

                            Grounds existed to support termination of the father’s parental rights for failure to make reasonable progress because the father did not achieve reasonable progress under his case plan or demonstrate an intention and commitment to do so. Therefore, there

                            Evidence of record supported the trial court’s findings of fact, which in turn supported its legal conclusion that the father’s protected status as parent was not constitutionally displaced; except for two driving while impaired convictions, there was
                            no evidence that the father drank to the point of intoxication, regularly or ever, the father had driven only once on a public road after his license had been revoked as he drove to the grandmother’s house after learning that

                            Appellate court found that remand for a new termination of parental rights hearing was necessary because there was no evidence presented at trial that would have supported termination of a parent’s parental rights based upon dependency. In re O.J.R.,

                            Trial court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights because its order was internally inconsistent and thus, unreviewable; there were contradictory findings as to the mother’s mental health care and her domestic violence issues, and the factor
                            of financial assistance to potential adoptive parents seemed to outweigh the close emotional bonds between the mother and children and her efforts to regain custody.

                            Trial court erred in terminating the mother’s parental rights based on failure to make reasonable progress, because it did not address her progress or lack thereof leading up to the termination hearing and its findings were insufficiently specific to

                            Because the trial court failed to make the required statutory finding regarding an appropriate alternative child care arrangement, and no evidence was presented that would have allowed the court to make such a finding, reversal of the court’s conclusion
                            that dependency provided a ground for termination of parental rights was appropriate. In re K.C.T., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 592</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 330, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1010 (2020).

                            Trial court’s order determining that the father’s parental rights in the daughter were subject to termination on the basis of neglect lacked sufficient support, although remand was required because the record contained evidence from which the trial court
                            could, if it elected to do so, find that a repetition of neglect would be probable in the event that the daughter was returned to the father’s care. In re Z.J.W., <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 760</cite>,

                            incapable of parenting the child, and did not address the issue of whether the mother’s condition would continue for the foreseeable future. In re M.J.R.B., 2021-NCSC-62, <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 453</cite>,

                            Since there was no conflicting evidence about either the likelihood of each child’s adoption if the mother’s rights were terminated or one child’s strong bond with his prospective adoptive parents, no written findings were required in this regard; as

                            incarcerated since September 2011, nothing indicated that she would be released from incarceration in the foreseeable future, and thus the trial court did not err in finding there was a reasonable probability that her incapability

                            incoherent, tending to stare off and to ignore those around her, and that the father stated that he was unwilling to let the children remain in the home because his violent temper made it unsafe for the children to be with

                            a total of $125 in monies and gifts; (2) the relationship was unlikely to change in the future due to the father’s lengthy incarceration and the child’s unwillingness to see him; and (3) the father’s only alternative for providing
                            for the care of the child was through the assistance of his parents, who had no relationship with the child, and even failed to attend the termination of parental rights hearing. In re Williams,

                            a safe home for the child based on the parents’ mental and physical illnesses. In re V.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 679, 608 S.E.2d 787, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 394 (2005).

                            There were sufficient findings to support the termination of parental rights order, including the fact that the father failed to propose an alternate replacement to take care of the children, that the father failed to provide any contact, love, or affection
                            for the children, and that the father failed to attempt to contact the children while he was incarcerated. In re D.J.D., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C.

                            Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated, under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) and (2) as she neglected her children and willfully left them in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress, after the children had been returned
                            to her once, as clear, cogent and convincing evidence showed she did not (1) complete required parenting, budgeting, and homemaking classes, (2) obtain mental health counseling, (3) have a phone, or (4) keep a clean home, and
                            she offered no specific plan for the children’s care while she worked, if they were returned, and the evidence showed her residential instability.

                            G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) provides for termination of parental rights if a parent has willfully left a juvenile in foster care or placement outside the home for more than 12 months without showing to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable progress under
                            the circumstances has been made in correcting those conditions which led to the removal of the juvenile, and willfulness may be found where a parent has made some attempt to regain custody of the child but has failed to exhibit
                            reasonable progress or a positive response toward the diligent efforts of a department of social services; extremely limited progress is not reasonable progress.

                            Fact that the father could have written but did not do so, that he made no efforts to provide anything for the minor child, that he did not provide any love, nurturing, or support for the minor child, that he would continue to neglect the minor child
                            if she were placed in his care, and that he would be incarcerated until the child reached the age of majority provided clear, cogent, and convincing evidence to support the termination of his parental rights. In re P.L.P.,

                            Evidence including the transient state of the mother’s housing, the mother’s untreated hygiene issues, and the mother’s failure to complete parenting classes was sufficient to support termination of the mother’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(9).

                            While the father complied with a number of elements of his case plan, the termination of father’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) was supported by evidence that the father continued to reside with the mother who had an untreated substance abuse
                            problem she would not admit to. In re S.N., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 636 S.E.2d 316, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2236 (2006).

                            Father’s assignments of error concerning the delay in filing a termination petition and other alleged technical errors did not provide a basis for overturning the trial court’s order terminating his parental rights where the father failed to allege any
                            prejudice to him or the child as a result of the technical errors. In re H.T., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 637 S.E.2d 923, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2497

                            Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated where notice of the petition to terminate was properly and timely served pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-5, the petition alleged three grounds for termination, including neglect, and the petition had incorporated
                            the trial court’s prior orders concerning the child, as well as the facts associated with those orders, thereby providing the factual allegations supporting the legal bases.

                            Parental rights were properly terminated under G.S. 7B-1111 because the trial court found that the children were abused under G.S. 7B-101(1) and that they exhibited symptoms of that abuse; further, the Department of Social Services met its burden of proving
                            that termination was in the best interests of the children under G.S. 7B-1110(a). In re L.C., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 638 S.E.2d 638, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 83 (2007).

                            Termination of a father’s parental rights was affirmed because the trial court’s findings regarding the father were properly supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, and its findings supported its conclusions; the trial court found that the
                            father abused two of his children, neglected his children, and willfully left his children in foster care for more than 12 months without showing reasonable progress.

                            Termination of a mother’s parental rights to her children pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(8) was affirmed because the trial court’s findings fully supported its determination that the mother committed voluntary manslaughter, as the evidence indicated that
                            the child died from injuries arising from abuse, and the trial court properly admitted evidence pursuant to hearsay exceptions, as a medical examiner’s report was admissible under G.S. 8C-1-803(8) as a public record, and a
                            police officer was properly allowed to testify as to statements by the mother’s daughter that she saw her mother hit the deceased child on the head pursuant to the excited utterance exception. In re J.S.B.,

                        <p>
                            When the mother was adjudicated competent, it established only that the mother regained the capacity to manage the mother’s own affairs, not that the mother, facing a termination of parental rights petition, had the capacity to provide proper care and
                            supervision for the child; in terminating the mother’s parental rights the court was entitled to find, based on the mother’s three-year history of relapses, that there was a reasonable probability that the mother’s incapacity
                            resulting from substance abuse disorder would continue. In re A.H., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 644 S.E.2d 635, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1159 (2007).

                            Termination of mother’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), was supported by evidence that, other than forensic psychological exam, the mother failed to follow through with any of the other activities regarding parenting, therapy, anger management,
                            or medication management. In re C.M.S., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 646 S.E.2d 592, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1433 (2007).

                        <p>
                            Trial court’s findings that the father failed to make reasonable progress were based on clear, cogent, and convincing evidence stemming from the period of time between the child’s initial removal and the entry of the consent order granting guardianship
                            to the guardians, as required by G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2); the findings included that the father only sporadically complied with the case plans and failed to show any positive response to assistance efforts, willfully refused to
                            stop using marijuana, and displayed inappropriate behavior and unwarranted hostility toward the department of social services, the foster parent, and the guardians.

                        <p>
                            In terminating parental rights, the trial court only needed to find one basis for termination pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111, and the trial court based its termination on detailed findings and conclusions as to ongoing, severe and repeated abuse of the child,
                            who suffered injuries that were not accidental (including fractures), who had failed to thrive, and who was an abused juvenile as defined by G.S. 7B-101(a); thus, respondent mother’s argument that the termination was based
                            solely on felonious child abuse charges lacked merit. In re R.B.B., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 654 S.E.2d 514, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2570 (2007).

                            Termination of a mother’s parental rights for willful abandonment under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) was supported by the evidence as: (1) the mother was required to complete a domestic violence program and a mental health assessment, and to follow through with
                            recommendations; (2) the mother entered the domestic violence program, but was terminated for lack of attendance; (3) the mother reentered, and attended 25 sessions, but was terminated for dishonesty because she did not disclose
                            to the program administrators that she was pregnant, and actively hid her pregnancy; (4) the mother failed to attend therapy sessions on a regular basis as recommended; and (5) a finding that the mother continued her relationship
                            with the father was supported. In re J.Z.M., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 663 S.E.2d 435, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1133 (2008).

                            Trial court’s findings were sufficient to support its conclusion that a parent’s lack of progress justified termination of parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2). The parent had not successfully completed substance abuse treatment or parenting classes,
                            and the parent’s extremely limited progress was not reasonable progress. In re S.N., <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1813 (N.C. Ct.

                            Although the father had made some progress, termination of father’s parental rights was proper because, at the time of the termination hearing, the father was unemployed, had not maintained suitable housing, had not participated in court-ordered anger
                            management counseling, and continued to allow one of the children to be in the presence of the mother despite numerous court orders prohibiting any contact between the mother and the children. In re N.A.L.,

                            Trial court did not err in ruling that grounds existed to terminate a mother’s parental rights to her child pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(8) because the trial court’s findings of fact supported its conclusion that the mother committed a felony assault that
                            resulted in serious bodily injury to another child in her care; the mother did not assign error to that conclusion of law, which precluded review of the conclusion on appeal under N.C. R. App. P. 10(a). In re I.T.P-L,

                            Parental rights were properly terminated under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) because the parents had not made progress in correcting the conditions that had led to the child’s removal, particularly as they had not completed parenting classes, the mother had not
                            provided proper care for the child during scheduled visits, and both parents continued to test positive for drug use. In re S.C.H., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 682 S.E.2d 469,

                            Termination of the father’s parental rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) and (3) was supported by the fact that the father did not contest the trial court’s conclusion that the father willfully failed to pay reasonable portion of cost of care for child, and
                            that fact that the evidence showed, inter alia, that the father failed to stay drug free, maintain suitable housing for child, or complete behavioral program.

                            Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court’s conclusion that parental rights could be terminated pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(9) because: (1) the parent’s therapist testified that the parent had consistently been in domestic violence situations
                            which caused the therapist to call the parent’s judgment into question about who the parent had living with the parent; (2) the therapist expressed a concern that something really bad at some point could happen to the child;
                            (3) the therapist opined that the parent had the ability to establish a safe home for the child; and (4) a foster care social worker testified that the worker was not certain that the child would be safe if the parent was not
                            on the parent’s medication and that parent had a history of inviting people to stay in the parent’s home that often had problems and the parent had a history of getting into physical altercations with people in the home or

                            and had failed to provide any meaningful support for the son; termination of the father’s parental rights would permit the son’s stepfather to adopt the son and provide stability for the child. In re A.J.M.P.,

                            Trial court properly determined that grounds existed to terminate a mother’s parental rights to her minor child pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6), as an acquaintance had been awarded custody of the child due to the mother’s substance abuse problems and abandonment
                            of the child; she could not unilaterally decide that she no longer wanted the acquaintance to have custody of the child. In re K.O., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 420, 735 S.E.2d 369,

                            In terminating the mother’s parental rights, the trial court properly found that there was a reasonable probability that the mother’s incapability of caring for the child would continue for the foreseeable future due to her incarceration. In re L.R.S.,

                            Trial court properly terminated the mother’s parental rights due to neglect, as there had been a prior finding of neglect and there would be a probable repetition of neglect if the child were returned to the mother given her failure to comply with the
                            recommendations made following psychiatric evaluations, her completion of only five of twelve sessions in a domestic violence program, her continued contact with the father, failure to complete her parenting classes, and inability
                            to keep a job. In re M.J.S.M., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 633, 810 S.E.2d 370, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 122 (2018).

                            Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper as the child was a dependent juvenile because the father conceded that due to his lengthy incarceration he could not provide care or supervision to the child; his proposed relative placement with
                            the father’s mother was not possible as she stated she had failing health and was residing in a retirement community that did not allow children; and his proposed relative placement with the father’s sister was not a viable
                            option as the child had been in level IV psychiatric treatment and had been moved to a level III group home, and no relative placement would currently be appropriate based on the level of care the child required. In re N.N.B.,

                            Unchallenged findings showed the mother repeatedly prioritized her relationship with the father over the safety of the children by continuing to allow the father around the children and by violating court orders and the mother’s refusal to acknowledge
                            the effect of domestic violence on the children and her inability to sever her relationship with the father supported the trial court’s determination that the neglect of the children would likely be repeated if they were returned
                            to the mother’s care, making termination proper. State v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 847 S.E.2d 449, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 600 (2020).

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper based on a failure to correct the conditions that led to the removal of the juveniles as the mother had unaddressed substance abuse issues, the condition of the home was unsafe, and she failed to
                            attend medical and developmental appointments for the juveniles. In re A.H.F.S., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 503</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 308, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1005 (2020).

                            Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper based on a failure to correct the conditions that led to the removal of the juveniles as the mother and father continued to reside together, and their primary residence was still unsafe. In re A.H.F.S.,

                            Father’s contention that his conduct did not evince a settled purpose to forego all parental duties or to relinquish all parental claims was unavailing given the unchallenged findings of fact which showed that the father petitioned for legal custody and
                            visitation rights before the determinative period began but took no further action. The father also did not provide any emotional or material support even though he could have, and the father’s actions as found by the trial
                            court, which led to the entry of the restraining order, supported a reasonable inference of willfulness. In re I.R.M.B., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 64</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 498, 2021- NCSC-27, 2021

                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper, as the child had been in foster care for more than 26 months, the mother did not adequately address her substance abuse, she had only been in her current housing for two months, which was inadequate,
                            and she had not established stable employment. Thus, the trial court properly determined that the mother’s tenuous, limited progress on the issues that directly led to the child’s prior adjudication was not enough to diminish
                            the probability that child would likely be neglected again. In re B.T.J., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 18</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 459 (2021).

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper, as she conceded that she left her children in foster care for 16 months, exceeding the 12 months required to terminate parental rights, and, contrary to the mother’s arguments, the trial court’s
                            findings involving the ample time she had to make progress on her case plan, her failure to adequately address her substance abuse and mental health issues, and the willfulness of her actions were all supported by clear, cogent,
                            and convincing evidence. In re A.M.L., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 1</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 439, 2021- NCSC-21, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 277 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly determined that the mother’s parental rights could be terminated because the mother did not make a reasonable effort to correct the issues attributable to her relationship with one child’s father and the prevalence of domestic violence
                            that led to the children’s removal from her care. Instead, she prioritized her relationship with that father while falsely and repeatedly claiming that the relationship had ended, evincing a willful failure to make reasonable
                            progress in addressing her issues with domestic violence. In re L.N.G., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 81</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 450, 2021- NCSC-29, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 283 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Order terminating the mother’s parental rights was supported by evidence that she failed to follow through with parenting classes, submitted to substance abuse assessments but had not complied with recommended services or requested drug screens, had not
                            provided documentation of her reported employment, failed to turn herself in for a probation violation, failed to follow through with mental health assessments and appointments, and fabricated the death of her mother as an
                            excuse to miss a review meeting. In re G.D.H., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 282</cite>, 856 S.E.2d 783, 2021- NCSC-46, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 396 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Order terminating the father’s parental rights was supported by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence and was based on proper legal grounds. Despite the earlier order requiring the father to demonstrate changes learned relating to domestic violence,
                            to resolve criminal matters, and to be of lawful behavior, he was found guilty of multiple infractions during his incarceration including gang behavior, assault on staff, possessing a weapon, and coordinating an assault. In
                            re A.R.W., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 234</cite>, 856 S.E.2d 826, 2021- NCSC-43, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 397 (2021).

                        <p>
                            After conducting a review of the entire record and the issues identified by counsel in the no-merit brief, the supreme court was satisfied that the trial court’s orders terminating the father’s parental rights in the children were supported by clear,
                            cogent, and convincing evidence, including the father’s denying any instance of domestic violence, and based on proper legal grounds. In re P.M., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 366</cite>, 856 S.E.2d
                            816, 2021- NCSC-54, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 398 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Termination of father’s parental rights was appropriate because the father willfully left the children in a placement outside the home for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions leading to the children’s removal.
                            The father’s failure to comply with the court’s orders or address substance abuse issues, as well as continued involvement in criminal conduct and resulting incarceration, also evinced a lack of reasonable progress from when
                            the children were removed from the custody of the children’s mother. In re D.M., 2021-NCSC-95, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 435</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 740, 2021- NCSC-95, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 853 (2021).

                            Termination of a mother’s parental rights was appropriate because the mother willfully left the mother’s child in foster care or placement outside the home for more than 12 months. Furthermore, the mother willfully failed to make reasonable progress in
                            correcting the conditions which led to the child’s removal as the mother largely failed to comply with the case plan, demonstrated continued instability during most of the case, was consistently transient and unable to maintain
                            stable employment, and remained completely dependent upon a paramour. In re A.S.D., 2021-NCSC-94, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 425</cite>, 861 S.E.2d 875, 2021- NCSC-94, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 847 (2021).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by terminating the father’s parental rights based on abandonment because when the motion to terminate was filed the father had not visited the child in more than a year, during that year he refused to work his case plan, during
                            the relevant period he did not make any effort to maintain any sort of parental bond with the child, and none of the father’s activities after the motion to terminate was filed occurred during the relevant period. In re I.J.W.,

                            Trial court did not err in terminating the father’s parental rights because he never entered into a case plan, his most recent incarceration stemmed from several felony drug charges, and he left the children in foster care for more than 12 months without
                            showing reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their removal. In re M.S., 2021-NCSC-75, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 30</cite>, 859 S.E.2d 152, 2021- NCSC-75, 2021 N.C. LEXIS

                            Trial court did not err in terminating the father’s parental rights because he failed to complete parenting classes, failed to obtain the appropriate assessments, tested positive for illegal drugs, refused at least four requested drug screens, and was
                            incarcerated several times when the child was in Department of Social Services custody. In re M.S., 2021-NCSC-75, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 30</cite>, 859 S.E.2d 152, 2021- NCSC-75, 2021 N.C.

                            Trial court did not err by terminating the father’s parental rights because he did not dispute the trial court’s finding of fact that he had not provided any financial support for the child within the six months immediately preceding the filing of the
                            termination petition even though he told the Department of Health and Human Services he was working. In re J.E.E.R., 2021-NCSC-74, <cite class="nc_code">378 N.C. 23</cite>, 859 S.E.2d 191, 2021-

                            Trial court did not err by finding the existence of a willful failure to make reasonable progress to correct the conditions that had led to the child’s removal from the mother’s home because the trial court did not act on the basis of a misapprehension
                            of law, it heard testimonial evidence relating to the period of time that followed the filing of the termination petition, and the mother failed to identify any inadmissible hearsay evidence upon which the trial court erroneously
                            relied. In re I.E.M., 2021-NCSC-133, <cite class="nc_code">379 N.C. 221</cite>, 864 S.E.2d 346, 2021- NCSC-133, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 1133 (2021).

                            The trial court erred in terminating a father’s parental rights on the grounds of the father’s incapability of caring for the child pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(6) (2001); the father was scheduled to be released from prison shortly, and there was no evidence
                            at trial to suggest that respondent suffered from any physical or mental illness or disability that would prevent him from providing proper care and supervision for the child, nor did the trial court make any findings of fact
                            regarding such a condition. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 286, 565 S.E.2d 245, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 718 (2002).

                            Where the child of respondent mother was removed from her because of the mother’s drug use, but, during the 12 months prior to the filing of a petition to terminate her parental rights, the mother successfully completed a drug abuse treatment program,
                            tested negative for drugs on several occasions, attended a drug abuser’s support group, maintained regular employment as a nurse, and showed herself to be a fit and proper person for visitation, such evidence showed that the
                            mother had made reasonable progress under the circumstances in correcting the conditions that led to the removal of the child; therefore, the trial court erred in terminating the mother’s parental rights. In re Pierce,

                            No evidence or finding suggested that the mother’s “social phobia” led or contributed to the parents’ failure to provide the children with sufficient food, nutrition, or hygiene, and thus, the trial court’s finding that the mother failed to make reasonable
                            progress to reunite with her children because she failed to seek services to address her “social phobia” was without statutory authority.

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights due to an inability to provide proper care an supervision was improper, as the Department of Health and Human Services failed to show that substance abuse would prevent the mother from providing for the proper
                            care and supervision of the children. In re A.G.M., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 773 S.E.2d 123, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 520 (2015).

                            abandonment; there was no evidence that the father had any court-ordered obligation to pay child support; and the trial court failed to make required findings on the ground that the father failed to legitimate the child. In

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights based on the ground of failure to make reasonable progress was proper because she had not maintained stable employment for a minimum of six months; she failed to obtain stable housing for at least six months
                            as her frequent moves constituted evidence of housing instability, and she was days shy of having resided at her current residence for the designated six-month period of time; and she failed to complete the recommended treatment
                            needed to fully address the core issues of substance abuse and domestic violence which had played the largest roles in the children’s removal. In re I.G.C., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 201</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper based on her willful failure to make reasonable progress because, inter alia, the mother voluntarily placed the children in the custody of the county department of social services so that the father
                            could live with her; and she failed to protect her children by allowing the father, who had assaulted her and two of the children, to return to the family home. In re A.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 190</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Evidence and findings of fact supported the trial court’s conclusion that a mother failed to make reasonable progress toward correcting the conditions which led to the removal of the mother’s child from the mother’s care because, after participating in
                            a drug rehabilitation program, the mother decided to address the mother’s long-standing addiction issue solely by entering a methadone program without any counseling plan to resolve the mother’s resultant dependence on that
                            substance. In re A.B.C., <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 752</cite>, 844 S.E.2d 902, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 620 (2020).

                        <p>
                            Termination of a mother’s parental rights was appropriate because the mother made little progress in satisfying the mother’s case plan as the mother failed to complete parenting classes, had not scheduled a mental health assessment, had not completed
                            substance abuse classes, had refused to participate in domestic violence treatment, had failed to submit to drug screens, had not visited with the children in months, and had been charged with drug related criminal offenses.

                            termination, because the child was removed from the mother home due to the mother’s substance abuse and substance use while in the child’s presence; the mother showed a consistent inability to successfully complete rehabilitation

                            Trial court, to find grounds to terminate a parent’s rights under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), must perform a two part analysis, as the trial court must determine by clear, cogent and convincing evidence: (1) that a child has been willfully left by the parent
                            in foster care or placement outside the home for over 12 months; and (2) as of the time of the hearing, also as demonstrated by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, that the parent has not made reasonable progress under the

                            of a putative father’s rights may precede an adoption petition, prior termination of his rights under this Chapter is not necessary if, under the applicable provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>,
                            his consent to the adoption is not necessary; his parental rights are then terminated by the final order of adoption under G.S. 48-23.

                            Although the breadth of “willful abandonment” should often encompass “willfully leaving” a child in foster care, the broad finding of willful abandonment is not essential to the more limited determination required under subdivision (3) of this section.

                            In the context of a termination based on willful abandonment, the word “willful” connotes purpose and deliberation; however, under this section willfulness is something less than willful abandonment.

                            “Willfulness” when terminating parental rights on the grounds of G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), is something less than “willful” abandonment, is not precluded even if the respondent has made some efforts to regain custody of the children, and may be found where
                            the parent, recognizing her inability to care for the children, voluntarily leaves the children in foster care. In re Shepard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 591 S.E.2d 1,

                            In view of the fact that nothing in the relevant statutory provisions limits the “conditions for removal” to those specified in any initial abuse, neglect, or dependency petition or any subsequent amendment to that petition and the fact that the department
                            adequately alleged that it was seeking to terminate respondent-mother’s parental rights in the mother pursuant to G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2), the notice-related concerns expressed by the Court of Appeals did not justify overturning

                            Termination of a mother’s parental rights was inappropriate because the mother’s child entered the custody of family relatives when the mother agreed to a voluntary kinship placement. Although the relatives later obtained full custody of the child through
                            a civil custody order, that order did not provide sufficient notice to the mother that the mother’s parental rights would be imperiled by the loss of custody or inform the parent what steps would be necessary to make reasonable
                            progress and avoid termination. In re K.C.T., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 592</cite>, 850 S.E.2d 330, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1010 (2020).

                            In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the trial court’s findings were not sufficient to support its conclusion that a father willfully left his child in foster care for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions
                            which led to the child’s removal under G.S. 7B-1111(2), because there were no findings as to the father’s progress or lack thereof during the relevant 12-month period before the termination petition was filed, and the father
                            had been incarcerated during those 12 months and had no involvement in the events which led to the child’s removal. In re Shermer, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 576 S.E.2d 403,

                            and, pursuant to the case plan, the father maintained contact with the department of social services, attended on-going substance abuse treatment, and completed the only parenting class offered by the Department of Correction,

                            mental health treatment and was inconsistent in participating in therapy for the child, who had been sexually abused by a sibling. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 741

                            In a private termination action where petitioners were also the custodians of the three children at issue, the mother’s parental rights to the three children were properly terminated under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2) because whether or not the mother was in a
                            position to actually regain custody of the children at the time of the termination hearing was not a relevant consideration under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(2); rather, the court only had to determine whether the mother had made reasonable
                            progress under the circumstances in correcting those conditions which led to the children’s removal. In re L.C.R., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 739 S.E.2d 596, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 342 (2013).

                            Trial court’s unchallenged findings, which were deemed to be supported by sufficient evidence and were binding on appeal, supported its adjudication that the mother willfully left her children in foster care for more than twelve months without making
                            reasonable progress to correct the conditions leading to their placements. In re H.D., <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 768 S.E.2d 860, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 72 (2015).

                            the custody of a county department of social services. The parent engaged in a pattern of self-defeating cycles of dishonesty, engaged in a pattern of violence with paramours, family members, and caretakers to the children,
                            and attempted to conceal unfavorable information from the court. In re A.B. J.B., <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 781 S.E.2d 685, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                            Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights to his child because it took the father nearly a year after his initial participation in the case to obtain independent housing, and even then, his housing was not appropriate for the child, the
                            father used an alias to sign his lease and did not know who would be living in his residence, without the name of a roommate, the Department of Social Services had no way to verify whether the residence would provide a safe
                            environment for the child, and the father’s completion of parenting classes amounted to nothing more than limited progress and did not rebut his failure to obtain adequate housing. In re J.A.K.,

                            Trial court’s findings fully supported its conclusion that grounds exist to terminate the mother’s parental rights as she willfully left the child in foster care for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that
                            led to her removal; the mother failed to participate in court-ordered visitation, to verifiably participate in substance abuse assessment or drug screenings, or to maintain housing and employment stability. In re C.J.,

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err in terminating the mother’s parental rights for willfully leaving her children in foster care or a placement outside of the home for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their
                            removal because she failed to comply with the components of her case plan addressing her parenting and mental health concerns; and, while she addressed the housing component of her case plan by moving from a motel room into
                            a house, she did so only a month before the termination hearing, which did not amount to reasonable progress in light of the fact that the children had been in the custody of the Youth and Family Services Division for over
                            three years. In re E.C., <cite class="nc_code">375 N.C. 581</cite>, 849 S.E.2d 806, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 1002 (2020).

                            Termination of the mother’s parental rights on the ground that she willfully failed to make reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to the children’s removal from her care was proper as she had continued to test positive for drugs and had
                            refused to comply with requested drug screens; and she never completed the domestic violence counseling ordered, and continued to relate and reside with the father whom she claimed set her on fire in front of the children.

                        <p>
                            Mother argued that she made reasonable progress, pointing to her participation in a program for people transitioning out of foster care, but her participation in that program alone was not sufficient to prevent or negate the conclusion that she failed
                            to make reasonable progress. In re Q.P.W., <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 738</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 214, 2021- NCSC-12, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 168 (2021).

                            Trial court properly found that grounds existed to terminate the mother’s parental rights; she willfully left the child in foster care as she had the ability to make reasonable progress but was unwilling to make an effort. Case plan requirements were
                            tied to alleviating the conditions that contributed to the child’s removal, namely the mother’s immaturity and instability, yet she failed to maintain housing, attend parenting classes, cooperate with drug screens, and attend
                            visits with the child. In re Q.P.W., <cite class="nc_code">376 N.C. 738</cite>, 855 S.E.2d 214, 2021- NCSC-12, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 168 (2021).

                            Termination of mother’s parental rights was appropriate as the mother willfully left the mother’s children in foster care or placement outside the home for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress toward correcting the substance abuse and
                            domestic violence issues which led to the removal of the children. The court detailed the mother’s positive tests for marijuana, failure to complete substance abuse treatment and domestic violence counseling programs, and repeated
                            acts of domestic violence involving consumption of alcohol. In re A.M., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 220</cite>, 856 S.E.2d 801, 2021- NCSC-42, 2021 N.C. LEXIS 404 (2021).

                            in foster care or placement outside them home for more than 12 months without making reasonable progress in 12 months, the error was harmless, as grounds also existed for termination for neglect under G.S. 7B-1111(a)(1) and

                            Court’s findings of fact did not support a determination that the mother willfully left the child in foster care or a placement outside the home without showing reasonable progress had been made in correcting the conditions that had led to the child’s
                            removal; the State failed to prove that the children would probably experience future neglect if they were returned to the mother’s care. In re D.A.A.R., <cite class="nc_code">377 N.C. 258</cite>,

                            A finding of willfulness under this section does not require a showing of fault on the part of the parent; willfulness may be found where the parent, recognizing her inability to care for the child, voluntarily leaves the child in foster care; therefore,
                            where respondent had been afforded almost double the statutory 18-month period in which to demonstrate her willingness to correct the conditions which led to the removal of her children, her failure to do so supported a finding

                            to accept any responsibility for her situation and would not appropriately interact with her child. In re Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 558 S.E.2d 498, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite>                            LEXIS 5 (2002).

                            (1) she entered a mental hospital, which caused the initial removal of her children, and she did not seek return of their custody for several year, (2) she refused to acknowledge and treat the very conditions that led to her
                            loss of custody and even refused to acknowledge the medical diagnosis of her children; (3) this behavior indicted that, if returned to her custody, she would not pursue treatment for herself or her children; and (4) any attempt
                            to set up a visitation with the children by the diligence of DSS or the children’s guardian ad litem was frustrated at the mother’s own behest.

                            left her children in foster care without making reasonable progress to correct the conditions that led to their placement. The findings supporting that conclusion included: the children were in foster care for over 12 months;
                            the mother missed seven out of eleven appointments and failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program; missed five out of ten parenting classes; tested positive for drugs several times; failed to establish a permanent

                            Because the children were not removed from the mother more than twelve months prior to the termination hearing, termination of the mother’s parental rights on the basis that she left the children in foster care of placement outside the home was not supported

                            had acted inconsistently with their rights as parents, but they did not identify the conditions that resulted in the involuntary removal of the child from the mother. Moreover, it was unclear from the findings of fact that

                            The language of former G.S. 7A-289.32(6) dictates that the Department of Social Services must prove that respondents failed to take, not one, but any of the four actions listed in paragraphs a to d thereof. In re Harris,

                            paternity over the minor child at issue, never legitimated the child by statute or marriage, nor had he provided any financial support.

                            incarcerated, the guardian ad litem failed to present any evidence that the father’s incapability of providing care and supervision was due to one of the specified conditions or any other similar cause or condition. In re J.K.C.,

                            custody of the minor child and it was unclear whether the minor child’s foster parent would be able to adopt the minor child, the court found that nothing within G.S. 7B-1110 required that termination lead to adoption in order
                            for termination to be in a child’s best interests, and the biological father had not taken any actions in G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5) exhibiting a parental interest in the minor child, which provided grounds for termination of his parental

                <p>
                    An order terminating the parental rights completely and permanently terminates all rights and obligations of the parent to the juvenile and of the juvenile to the parent arising from the parental relationship, except that the juvenile’s right of inheritance
                    from the juvenile’s parent shall not terminate until a final order of adoption is issued. The parent is not thereafter entitled to notice of proceedings to adopt the juvenile and may not object thereto or otherwise participate therein:

                        including a petition or motion filed pursuant to G.S. 7B-1103(a)(6), that agency shall, upon entry of the order terminating parental rights, acquire all of the rights for placement of the juvenile, except as otherwise provided
                        in G.S. 7B-908(d), as the agency would have acquired had the parent whose rights are terminated released the juvenile to that agency pursuant to the provisions of Part 7 of Article 3 of Chapter 48 of the General Statutes, including
                        the right to consent to the adoption of the juvenile.

                        Where father’s parental rights had been terminated under G.S. 7B-1112 in 1999, he lacked standing to bring an action under G. S. 49-10, G.S. 49-11 to legitimate the same child to whom his parental rights had been terminated. Gorsuch v. Dees,

                        duress when the mother signed the consent due to the adoptive parents’ relationship to the mother’s boyfriend, and (3) the order terminating the mother’s parental rights, entered in a Florida court, was a final order, for res judicata

                    The process of selection of specific adoptive parents shall be the responsibility of and within the discretion of the county department of social services or licensed child-placing agency. In selecting the adoptive parents, any current placement provider
                    wanting to adopt the child shall be considered. The guardian ad litem may request information from and consult with the county department or child-placing agency concerning the selection process. If the guardian ad litem requests information
                    about the selection process, the county shall provide the information within five business days. The county department of social services shall notify the guardian ad litem and the foster parents of the selection of prospective adoptive
                    parents within 10 days of the selection and before the filing of the adoption petition. If the guardian ad litem disagrees with the selection of adoptive parents or the foster parents want to adopt the juvenile and were not selected
                    as adoptive parents, the guardian ad litem or foster parents shall file a motion within 10 days of the department’s notification and schedule the case for hearing on the next juvenile calendar. The department shall not change the juvenile’s
                    placement to the prospective adoptive parents unless the time period for filing a motion has expired and no motion has been filed. The Department shall provide a copy of a motion for judicial review of adoption selection to the foster
                    parents not selected. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make the foster parents a party to the proceeding solely based on receiving notification and the right to be heard by filing a motion. In hearing any motion, the court
                    shall consider the recommendations of the agency and the guardian ad litem and other facts related to the selection of adoptive parents. The court shall then determine whether the proposed adoptive placement is in the juvenile’s best
                    interests.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that it is the public policy of this State to prevent the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles. The General Assembly further finds that the prevention of the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles is a community responsibility;
                    that professionals from disparate disciplines have responsibilities for children or juveniles and have expertise that can promote their safety and well-being; and that multidisciplinary reviews of the abuse, neglect, and death of juveniles
                    can lead to a greater understanding of the causes and methods of preventing these deaths. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly, through this Article, to establish a statewide multidisciplinary, multiagency child fatality
                    prevention system consisting of the State Team established in G.S. 7B-1404 and the Local Teams established in G.S. 7B-1406. The purpose of the system is to assess the records of selected cases in which children are being served by
                    child protective services and the records of all deaths of children in North Carolina from birth to age 18 in order to (i) develop a communitywide approach to the problem of child abuse and neglect, (ii) understand the causes of childhood
                    deaths, (iii) identify any gaps or deficiencies that may exist in the delivery of services to children and their families by public agencies that are designed to prevent future child abuse, neglect, or death, and (iv) make and implement
                    recommendations for changes to laws, rules, and policies that will support the safe and healthy development of our children and prevent future child abuse, neglect, and death.

                        The common thread running throughout the Juvenile Code (formerly G.S. 7A-516, et seq.) is that the court must consider the child’s best interests in making all placements whether at the dispositional hearing or the review hearing. In re Shue,

                        There are certain constitutional rights which a juvenile has at a juvenile hearing which are not required in civil trials, such as the right to counsel if there is a possibility of commitment and the privilege against self incrimination. This would suggest

                        The trial court erred in not dismissing petitions against six juveniles who received unequal treatment relative to other juveniles who were alleged to have committed the same or similar offenses by design, in that each respondent was prosecuted because
                        he or she, or his or her parents, was unwilling or unable to pay $1,000 compensation to the victim, while the other juveniles, who were similarly situated, were not prosecuted because they, or their parents, were able or willing
                        to pay $1,000 thereto. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 352 S.E.2d 889, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2500 (1987).

                    are unable to send the student to school for the term of compulsory attendance for the reasons given. If the court finds, after careful investigation, that the student or the parents have made or are making a bona fide effort to comply

                        The amendment of former G.S. 7A-278(2), removing violation of probation from the definition of “delinquent child,” indicated an intent that only criminal activity could provide the basis for an adjudication of delinquency. The legislative purpose in removing
                        probation violations as the basis for adjudications of delinquency would be frustrated if the courts were to take those very same violations, treat them as criminal contempt, and then base adjudications of delinquency on the contempt

                        over defendant for the conspiracy charge, his conviction was vacated. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1509

                        On a petition alleging that a child of 12 was delinquent, as defined in former G.S. 7A-517(12) (see now G.S. 7B-1501(7)), where the State established only that the child entered an unlocked door into a lighted store during daylight hours, that he did
                        so in front of at least one known witness, and that he took nothing, the State’s evidence failed to establish the elements of the crime charged (breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny) and dismissal of the action was

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2013-360, s. 8.49(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2014-115, s. 64, provides: “(a) Notwithstanding any provisions in Part 1 of Article 26 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 115C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, G.S. 7B-1501(27), 115C-238.66(3), 116-235(b)(2), and 143B-805(20) to the contrary, the State Board of Education shall authorize the Hickory Public Schools and the Newton-Conover City Schools to establish and
                    implement a pilot program pursuant to this section to increase the high school dropout age from 16 years of age to the completion of the school year coinciding with the calendar year in which a student reaches 18 years of age, unless
                    the student has previously graduated from high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(a1) For the purposes of implementing the pilot program authorized by this section, a local school administrative unit that is participating in the pilot program shall have the authority to provide that, if the principal or the principal’s designee determines
                    that a student’s parent, guardian, or custodian, or a student who is 18 years of age, has not made a good-faith effort to comply with the compulsory attendance requirements of the pilot program, the principal shall notify the district
                    attorney and, if the student is less than 18 years of age, the director of social services of the county where the student resides. If the principal or the principal’s designee determines that a parent, guardian, or custodian of a
                    student less than 18 years of age has made a good-faith effort to comply with the law, the principal may file a complaint with the juvenile court counselor pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7B</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes that the student is habitually absent from school without a valid excuse. Upon receiving notification by the principal or the principal’s designee, the director of social services shall determine whether to
                    undertake an investigation under G.S. 7B-302.

                    shall be excused from attendance, including if the student has attained a high school equivalency certificate or a student has enlisted as a member of the Armed Forces.

                    (ii) student who is 18 years of age enrolled in a school located within a participating local school administrative unit who violates the compulsory attendance provisions of the pilot program without a lawful exception recognized under
                    Part 1 of Article 26 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 115C</a></cite> of the General Statutes or the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

                    for the support of himself or herself or the support of the family, then the school social worker of the applicable school located within the participating school administrative unit shall diligently inquire into the matter and bring
                    it to the attention of an appropriate court, depending on the age of the student. The court shall proceed to find whether as a matter of fact the student is unable to attend the school or such parents, or persons standing in loco parentis,
                    are unable to send the student to school for the term of compulsory attendance for the reasons given. If the court finds, after careful investigation, that the student or the parents have made or are making a bona fide effort to comply
                    with the compulsory attendance law, and by reason of illness, lack of earning capacity, or any other cause which the court may deem valid and sufficient, the student is unable to attend school, then the court shall find and state what
                    help is needed for the student or family to enable compliance with the attendance requirements under the pilot program.

                    on Education/Higher Education on or before January 15, 2016. The report shall include at least all of the following information:

                        The amendment of former G.S. 7A-278(2), removing violation of probation from the definition of “delinquent child,” indicated an intent that only criminal activity could provide the basis for an adjudication of delinquency. The legislative purpose in removing
                        probation violations as the basis for adjudications of delinquency would be frustrated if the courts were to take those very same violations, treat them as criminal contempt, and then base adjudications of delinquency on the contempt

                        Because a district court never exercised jurisdiction over defendant for the charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the superior court that convicted him never obtained jurisdiction via transfer of the charge; because the trial court lacked jurisdiction

                        so in front of at least one known witness, and that he took nothing, the State’s evidence failed to establish the elements of the crime charged (breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny) and dismissal of the action was

                        It was error for the court of appeals to vacate a juvenile’s delinquency adjudication based on a sexual battery charge on the grounds that a juvenile court counselor (JCC) did not comply with the timelines contained in G.S. 7B-1703, when the JCC had filed
                        a petition alleging the juvenile committed simple assault and then filed a second petition, based on the same incident, alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, on the grounds that the alleged failure to comply with these
                        timelines deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, because the legislature did not intend G.S. 7B-1703’s timing requirements to be jurisdictional, as the legislature did not mention jurisdiction in the statute or
                        state a JCC’s failure to meet the statutory timing requirements divested a court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re D.S., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 184</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 758, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 434

                        State court’s records relating to defendant’s 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult, G.S. 7B-2200 and G.S. 7B-2203, North Carolina’s
                        district courts possessed exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, G.S. 7B-1601, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile, he could have been prosecuted
                        only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant’s 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions
                        were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 11193 (4th Cir. 2006).

                <p>
                    The chief court counselor, under the direction of the Division, shall establish intake services in each judicial district of the State for all delinquency and undisciplined cases and all complaints against vulnerable juveniles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of intake services shall be to determine from available evidence whether there are reasonable grounds to believe the facts alleged are true, to determine whether the facts alleged constitute a delinquent or undisciplined offense within the
                    jurisdiction of the court, to determine whether the facts alleged are sufficiently serious to warrant court action, and to obtain assistance from community resources when court referral is not necessary or allowed. The juvenile court
                    counselor shall not engage in field investigations to substantiate complaints or to produce supplementary evidence but may refer complainants to law enforcement agencies for those purposes.

                        Juvenile court counselor (JCC) did not violate G.S. 7B-1702 when evaluating a complaint against appellant, a juvenile, because (1) an officer’s evidence showed legal sufficiency and jurisdiction supporting the complaint, making victim contact unnecessary,

                        It was error to vacate a juvenile’s delinquency adjudication for sexual battery on the grounds that a juvenile court counselor (JCC) did not file the petition on which the adjudication was based within the timelines required by G.S. 7B-1703 because the
                        JCC timely filed the petition, as the required timelines began when the JCC received a complaint alleging sexual battery one day before the petition was filed, even though the JCC had previously filed a simple assault petition

                        Before a juvenile petition may be filed charging any juvenile with being delinquent or undisciplined, the record must affirmatively disclose that either the intake counselor or the district attorney has approved the filing of such petition. Furthermore
                        when the district attorney approves the filing of such petition, the record must affirmatively disclose that the intake counselor has theretofore disapproved the filing.

                        Petition alleging appellant delinquent for disorderly conduct at school failed to include a signature from the juvenile court counselor and did not indicate whether or not it was “approved for filing,” as required by G.S. 7B-1703. The trial court therefore
                        was without jurisdiction to proceed on the merits of the petition. In re T.K., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 800 S.E.2d 463, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 373 (2017).

                        The trial court erred in not dismissing petitions against six juveniles who received unequal treatment relative to other juveniles who were alleged to have committed the same or similar offenses by design, in that each respondent was prosecuted because

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction over a juvenile petition because the petition was not filed in the office of the clerk of superior court until more than thirty days after receipt of the complaint and thus was untimely pursuant to G.S. 7B-1703; the
                        timely filing of a petition seeking judicial action was jurisdictional. In re J.B., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 650 S.E.2d 457, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2231

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred by adjudicating a juvenile delinquent as a result of the juvenile court counselor failing to file the petition within the 15-day period following the filing of the complaint as mandated by G.S. 7B-1703(b); thus, the trial court lacked
                        jurisdiction to decide the matter. In re K.W., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 812, 664 S.E.2d 66, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1477 (2008).

                        It was error for the court of appeals to vacate a juvenile’s delinquency adjudication based on a sexual battery charge on the grounds that a juvenile court counselor (JCC) did not comply with the timelines contained in G.S. 7B-1703, when the JCC had filed
                        a petition alleging the juvenile committed simple assault and then filed a second petition, based on the same incident, alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, because the JCC complied with the statute’s timelines, requiring
                        the JCC to file a petition within 15 days of receiving a complaint, since (1) the JCC filed the sexual battery petition one day after receiving a complaint alleging the juvenile committed sexual battery, (2) the JCC was not required
                        to investigate the facts underlying the prior, simple assault, complaint to determine if the facts supported the filing of a petition alleging sexual battery, and, (3) while the assault complaint alleged the juvenile touched a
                        victim on the victim’s buttocks and between the victim’s legs, that complaint did not allege the juvenile committed sexual battery or touched the victim for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification. In re D.S.,

                        timelines deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction, because the legislature did not intend G.S. 7B-1703’s timing requirements to be jurisdictional, as the legislature did not mention jurisdiction in the statute or
                        state a JCC’s failure to meet the statutory timing requirements divested a court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re D.S., <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 184</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 758, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 434

                        The issuance and service of process is the means by which the court obtains jurisdiction; thus, where no summons was issued, the court acquired jurisdiction over neither the persons nor the subject matter of the action, and was without authority to enter

                        Trial court did not have jurisdiction over a juvenile petition because the petition was not filed in the office of the clerk of superior court until more than thirty days after receipt of the complaint and thus was untimely pursuant to G.S. 7B-1703; the

                    <p>
                        A trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter orders in a juvenile delinquency proceeding where no summons, petition or other notice was ever served on the juvenile or her parents, guardian or custodian prior to any of the hearings. In re McAllister,

        Trial Court Properly Exercised Personal Jurisdiction over Juvenile. —

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over the juvenile on a simple assault petition, as the juvenile’s and the juvenile’s parent’s presence at the hearing on that petition as well as the juvenile’s participation in the hearing without
                        objection constituted a general appearance for the purposes of waiving any defect in service. In re Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 568 S.E.2d 878, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1086 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not lack personal jurisdiction over defendant juvenile even though service of process was not made five days prior to the hearing as required by G.S. 7B-1806, where neither defendant nor his counsel contested service of process or personal
                        jurisdiction at any of the numerous hearings they participated in. In re D.S.B., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 577, 634 S.E.2d 633, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1961 (2006).

                        Statement on return that service was accomplished implies that it was done in the manner required by law. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 3130 (1984).

                        It is the service of summons, rather than the return of the officer, that confers jurisdiction. In re Leggett, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 745, 314 S.E.2d 144, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3130

                        Failure of a record of a juvenile delinquency proceeding to show the exact time and manner of service of the summons and petition upon the juvenile and his parents was not fatal where the record affirmatively showed that the juvenile and his mother were
                        in fact accorded sufficient notice of the hearing at which he was adjudicated delinquent to provide adequate opportunity to prepare, that at least seven days prior to the hearing he had been represented by privately employed counsel,

                        There is a substantive difference between the quantum of adequate proof of neglect and dependency for purposes of termination and for purposes of removal. The most significant difference is that while parental rights may not be terminated for threatened

                        Trial court properly ordered that a juvenile be confined to secure custody pending disposition pursuant to G.S. 7B-1903(c) because the juvenile had previously been adjudicated as delinquent, she admitted to subsequent probation violations, and the trial

                        no reason that G.S. 7B-1906(b) hearings should be limited to pre-adjudication confinement, and a juvenile confined to secure custody pending disposition or placement is entitled to a hearing at intervals of no more than ten calendar

                        Because this statute applies when the trial court holds a hearing to determine whether to continue a juvenile’s secure custody following an initial accusation of delinquency rather than when the trial court orders that a juvenile be held in secure custody
                        pending the effectuation of a legally authorized out-of-home placement, this statute was not applicable to the trial court’s decision that the juvenile be held in secure custody pending his transfer to an out-of-home placement.

                        Hearing on five petitions alleging abuse, neglect, and/or dependency was clearly denominated a hearing to determine the need for continued custody. The judge therefore had the discretion to either continue nonsecure custody or to return the children to

                        Trial court erred by failing to entertain a juvenile’s motion to review an order of secure custody under G.S. 7B-1906(b); because G.S. 7B-1903 provides for secure custody during both pre-adjudication and post-adjudication, pending disposition, there is
                        no reason that G.S. 7B-1906(b) hearings should be limited to pre-adjudication confinement, and a juvenile confined to secure custody pending disposition or placement is entitled to a hearing at intervals of no more than ten calendar

                    In any case when no parent, guardian, or custodian appears in a hearing with the juvenile or when the court finds it would be in the best interests of the juvenile, the court may appoint a guardian of the person for the juvenile. The guardian shall operate
                    under the supervision of the court with or without bond and shall file only such reports as the court shall require. Unless the court orders otherwise, the guardian:

                        May consent to certain actions on the part of the juvenile in place of the parent or custodian, including (i) marriage, (ii) enlisting in the Armed Forces of the United States, and (iii) enrollment in school.

                        Presence of a school resource officer (SRO) or other law enforcement officer while a student is interrogated by a school official weighs heavily on the scale when determining whether what otherwise might appear to be a voluntary encounter is instead a
                        custodial interrogation. Involvement of an SRO in the questioning of a child is a factor which is relevant, but not by itself dispositive, to the question of whether the encounter between a child and a school official is a custodial
                        interrogation. Court still must look to all of the remaining Miranda factors. In re D.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 857 S.E.2d 771, 2021- NCCOA-135, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 166 (2021).

                        When a student is interrogated in the presence of a school resource officer (SRO), even when the SRO remains silent, the presence of the officer can create a coercive environment that goes above and beyond the restrictions normally imposed during school,
                        such that a reasonable student would readily believe they are not free to go. In re D.A.H., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. App.</cite> 16, 857 S.E.2d 771, 2021- NCCOA-135, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 166 (2021).

                        Under U.S. Const., Amends. V and VI, an accused, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further
                        communication, exchanges or conversations with the police. A juvenile’s right, pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S. 7A-595, to have a parent present during custodial interrogation is entitled to similar protection. State
                        v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 100</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 518, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2429 (1986), overruled in part, State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 332</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 823, 2001 N.C.

                        When juvenile invoked the right to have a parent present during the interrogation, all interrogation should have ceased; since it did not, the trial court erred by denying the juvenile’s motion to suppress the statement, which was elicited in violation
                        of G.S. 7B-2101(d). State v. Branham, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 91, 569 S.E.2d 24, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1078 (2002).

                        There was evidentiary support for a trial court’s determination that defendant juvenile’s parents were in close proximity when he was talking to police officers for purposes of his challenge to an inculpatory statement that he made, which he alleged required
                        suppression under Miranda and G.S. 7B-2101; based on their location in their house while the juvenile talked to the police outside, they were near at hand during the questioning process. In re D.A.C.,

                        statement was at best an ambiguous invocation of his right to have his mother present under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-2101(a)(3), which did not require cessation of questioning; because the appellate court did not reach the question
                        of whether defendant’s waiver of his statutory and constitutional rights was valid, remand was necessary. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C.

                        Statutory language is clearly intended to codify the rights afforded to a juvenile subjected to custodial interrogation pursuant to Miranda in addition to affording a juvenile the State statutory right to have a parent, guardian, or custodian present
                        during the interrogation process. State v. Saldierna, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 407</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 174, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 626 (2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 1279, 203 L. Ed. 2d 290, 2019 U.S. LEXIS

                        Where juvenile defendant was not informed of his right to have a parent, guardian or custodian present during questioning, there can be no finding that such defendant knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived this privilege. State v. Fincher,

                    <p>
                        The failure to advise juvenile defendant of his right to have a parent, custodian or guardian present during questioning is not an error of constitutional magnitude, because this privilege is statutory in origin and does not emanate from the Constitution.
                        Therefore, the standard set forth in G.S. 15A-1443(a) must be applied to determine whether the erroneous admission into evidence of defendant’s statements to police officers was sufficient to warrant a new trial. State v. Fincher,
                        <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 1</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 685, 1983 N.C. LEXIS 1308 (1983).

                        There was no custodial interrogation where juvenile defendant was repeatedly told he was not under arrest and was free to leave at any time, and where he signed a statement wherein he stated that he was not under arrest and was giving a statement voluntarily.

                        or otherwise inadmissible. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 142</cite>, 463 S.E.2d 193, 1995 N.C. LEXIS 545 (1995).

                        . . . Anything you say can be used against you in court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have him with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed
                        for you before questioning if you wish. You have the right to have your parent, guardian, or custodian with you during questioning. If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer, parent, guardian or custodian present,
                        you will still have the right to stop answering questions at any time until you talk to a lawyer, parent, guardian, or custodian.” State v. McKeithan, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 537

                        This section requires the trial court to find as a fact that the juvenile knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived his juvenile rights prior to admitting any statement made by the juvenile during a custodial interrogation. In re Ewing,

                        When a juvenile challenged the admission of his confession because it was obtained without the juvenile’s parent present, as the parent had voluntarily absented himself from the juvenile’s interrogation, it was error for the trial court to fail to determine
                        whether the juvenile was in custody when the confession was obtained. In re Butts, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 582 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 928 (2003).

                        In a delinquency proceeding, the trial court erred by failing to suppress the juvenile’s incriminating statements made while he was detained by school officials as the juvenile, while he was being detained, was treated in such a way that a reasonable
                        person in his situation would have believed he was functionally under arrest; juvenile gave incriminating statements in the course of custodial interrogation without being afforded Miranda warnings and the warnings required under
                        G.S. 7B-2101(a) and without being afforded his right to have a parent present during interrogation pursuant to G.S. 7B-2101(b). In re K.D.L., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 700 S.E.2d 766,

                        Although the trial record did not contain the findings required by former G.S. 7A-595(d), admission of defendant’s statement at trial was not prejudicial because it was not inculpatory. It merely gave somewhat differing versions of the defendant’s whereabouts

                        Court of appeals erred in reversing an order adjudicating defendant juvenile a delinquent on the ground that he unlawfully and willfully possessed a weapon on school property because the trial court did not err in admitting, without objection, defendant’s
                        statement that he possessed the knife on school property; the supreme court was not prepared to conclude that the school resource officer’s presence and participation during the interrogation of defendant at the request of school
                        administrators conducting the investigation rendered the questioning of defendant a custodial interrogation requiring Miranda warnings and the protections of G.S. 7B-2101, and because no motion to suppress defendant’s statement
                        was made, no evidence was presented and no findings were made as to either the officer’s actual participation in the questioning or the custodial or noncustodial nature of the interrogation or as to whether the statements were
                        freely and voluntarily made. In re W.R., <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 244</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 342, 2009 N.C. LEXIS 346 (2009).

                        when he confessed to four crimes. He had been escorted from class to a conference room, where a police investigator was present along with an assistant principal, one of the assistant principal’s interns, and the school resource
                        officer, and there was no indication in the trial court’s findings that the juvenile had been restrained in any way or that anyone stood guard at the conference room door, which had been closed, but not locked. In re J.D.B.,

                        whether there was a formal arrest or a restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest was not equivalent to the broader free to leave test that had long been used for determining, under the Fourth

                        custody for purposes of G.S. 7B-2101 was rejected as defendant did not show that the officer’s inquiry subjected him to even a minimal restraint on his freedom of movement or his ability to act as he chose; even if defendant did
                        not feel free to go anywhere he wished at the time of his conversation with the officer, the fact that a defendant was not free to leave did not necessarily constitute custody for purposes of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

                        involved in a motor vehicle accident remain on the scene of the accident did not equate with a restraint on that individual’s freedom equivalent to a formal arrest for custodial interrogation purposes. In re A.N.C.,

                        Trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress his incriminating statement on the ground that it was obtained in violation of G.S. 7B-2101; although he invoked his right to have his mother present during questioning, defendant later initiated
                        further communication and waived right. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 705 S.E.2d 409, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 182 (2011).

                        was an error, and considering evidence supporting the finding that defendant did not request his mother or ask to contact her, defendant never invoked his right to have his mother present for questioning, and that the evidence

                        Trial court erred by concluding that the juvenile defendant knowingly, willingly, and understandingly waived his rights under the constitution or this section because defendant was 16 years old, he had only obtained an eighth grade education, Spanish
                        was his primary language, he was not familiar with the criminal justice system, the record indicated that he did not fully understand the detective’s questions, no copy of the Spanish version of the juvenile waiver of rights form
                        existed in the record, before beginning her questioning the detective mischaracterized the gravity of the situation, and he asked to call his mother immediately after signing a form stating he was giving up his rights including

                        of his juvenile rights in English and Spanish, and he signed the juvenile rights waiver form, which indicated he decided to waive his rights and to speak with the detective without the presence of a parent, guardian, custodian,

                        Trial court erred in concluding that defendant juvenile’s confession was not the product of a custodial interrogation; juvenile, who was 13 years old, was questioned in the principal’s office alongside the school resource officer, was neither told he
                        was free to leave nor that he did not have to answer questions, and was not provided the option of contacting his guardian until after he had already confessed. Trial court was required to take these circumstances into account

                        did not have to answer the questions, and he was allowed to leave the school when the bell rang. In re J.D.B., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C.

                        As the juvenile was not subject to a restraint on his freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest, the juvenile was not in custody for the purposes of being informed of juvenile or Miranda rights, and the trial court correctly determined
                        that there was no requirement that the juvenile be informed of, or waive, such rights prior to the interview with the detective. In re Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 568 S.E.2d 878,

                    to superior court for trial as an adult in which case procedures applicable to adults, as set out in Articles 14 and 23 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, shall apply. A nontestimonial identification order authorized by this Article may be issued by any judge of the district court or of the superior court upon request of a prosecutor. As used in this Article,
                    “nontestimonial identification” means identification by fingerprints, palm prints, footprints, measurements, blood specimens, urine specimens, saliva samples, hair samples, or other reasonable physical examination, handwriting exemplars,
                    voice samples, photographs, and lineups or similar identification procedures requiring the presence of a juvenile.

                        Application of the provisions of former G.S. 7A-596 and former G.S. 7A-598 to take the fingerprints of a juvenile accused of a crime committed prior to their effective date does not offend N.C. Const., Art. I, § 16, which forbids the enactment of any
                        ex post facto law or a like prohibition found in U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10. In re Stedman, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 92</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 527, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1242 (1982).

                        G.S. 15A-502(c) and former G.S. 7A-596 are procedural statutes, and a change in the evidentiary or procedural law between the time of the offense and the time of trial does not preclude the State from utilizing the new procedure even though at the time
                        of the offense it was unavailable. In re Stedman, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 92</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 527, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1242 (1982).

                    <p>
                        In determining whether evidence obtained in violation of former G.S. 7A-596 should be excluded, the court will consider the following factors: (a) The importance of the particular interest violated; (b) the extent of the deviation from lawful conduct;
                        (c) the extent to which the violation was willful; (d) the extent to which exclusion will tend to deter future violations of the statute. State v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 335

                        The legislature did not intend to preclude the use of the showup in juvenile investigations without a court order. This technique serves the important law enforcement objective of efficiency and protects the juvenile from more intrusive identification

                <p>
                    A juvenile in custody for or charged with an offense which if committed by an adult would be a felony offense may request that nontestimonial identification procedures be conducted. If it appears that the results of specific nontestimonial identification
                    procedures will be of material aid to the juvenile’s defense, the judge to whom the request was directed must order the State to conduct the identification procedures.

                        Although the doctrine of doli incapax may still apply in other contexts, former G.S. 7A-608, as amended in 1994, expresses legislative intent to supersede the doctrine of doli incapax in the context of the transfer of a juvenile, between the ages of thirteen
                        and fourteen, to superior court for trial. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 477 S.E.2d 182, <cite class="nc_code">1996 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1055 (1996), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>,

                        State court’s records relating to defendant’s 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult, G.S. 7B-2200 and G.S. 7B-2203 ( North Carolina’s
                        district courts possessed exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, G.S. 7B-1601, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile, he could have been prosecuted
                        only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant’s 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions
                        were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 11193 (4th Cir. 2006).

                        A probable cause hearing is not conducted for the purposes of discovery; its purpose is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the juvenile respondent committed it. A further purpose of the probable

                        The legislature intended that rights accorded a juvenile by former G.S. 7A-609 also should be accorded a juvenile with regard to the District Court’s consideration and decision as whether to transfer jurisdiction over the juvenile to Superior Court for

                        hearing to the next or set a date for that hearing; thus, the trial court may conduct all three hearings in one proceeding, so long as the juvenile’s requisite statutory and constitutional rights are safeguarded. In re J.J.,

                        to order the transfer, he must state his reasons therefor. In re Bunn, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 239 S.E.2d 483, <cite class="nc_code">1977 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1783 (1977) (decided

                        The decision on whether the case will be transferred to the superior court is left solely within the sound discretion of the district court judge who conducts the probable cause hearing. The exercise of that discretion is not subject to review in the

                        Superior court erred in finding that a district court abused the court’s discretion in transferring a juvenile’s case to the superior court because the superior court failed to properly apply the abuse of discretion standard of review and effectively
                        engaged in de novo review by making findings on the evidence relating to the factors set forth in G.S. 7B-2203(b); the superior court chose to give more weight than the district court did to the expert testimony addressing the
                        facilities and programs available in the juvenile system and the likelihood that the juvenile would benefit from such treatment, but the district court found other factors to be more compelling and entitled to greater weight, including
                        the juvenile’s age, his average to above average cognitive abilities, the aggressive, violent, premeditated, and willful manner in which the alleged crimes were committed, and the seriousness of the crimes. In re E.S.,

                        the seriousness of the offenses, the fact that the victim was a stranger to the juvenile, the community’s need to be aware of and protected from such serious crimes, defendant’s history of assaultive behavior, his acknowledgment

                        State court’s records relating to defendant’s 1995 convictions revealed that they were adult convictions; although a seventeen-year-old could be tried in North Carolina as either a juvenile or an adult, G.S. 7B-2200 and G.S. 7B-2203, North Carolina’s
                        district courts possessed exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who was alleged to be delinquent, G.S. 7B-1601, thus, if defendant was tried and convicted as a juvenile, he could have been prosecuted
                        only in a North Carolina district court. The judgments underlying defendant’s 1995 convictions, however, demonstrated that he was convicted and sentenced in the Superior Court of Surry County, North Carolina, and his 1995 Convictions
                        were therefore necessarily adult convictions. United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 11193 (4th Cir. 2006).

                        It has never been the practice in juvenile proceedings wholly to exclude parents, relatives or friends, or to refuse juveniles the benefit of counsel. Even so, such proceedings are usually conducted without admitting the public generally. In re Burrus,

                    At any hearing authorized or required by this Subchapter, the judge may subject a juvenile to physical restraint in the courtroom only when the judge finds the restraint to be reasonably necessary to maintain order, prevent the juvenile’s escape, or provide

                    are ordered, the judge shall make findings of fact in support of the order.

                        It has never been the practice in juvenile proceedings wholly to exclude parents, relatives or friends, or to refuse juveniles the benefit of counsel. Even so, such proceedings are usually conducted without admitting the public generally. In re Burrus,

                        It is a discretionary matter with the trial judge whether the general public (which includes newspaper reporters) is excluded from a juvenile hearing. In re Potts, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 188 S.E.2d 643,

                            So long as proceedings in the juvenile court meet the requirements of due process, they are constitutionally sound and must be upheld. This means that: (1) The basic requirements of due process and fairness must be satisfied in a juvenile court adjudication
                            of delinquency. (2) U.S. Const., Amend. XIV applies to prohibit the use of a coerced confession of a juvenile. (3) Notice must be given in juvenile proceedings which would be deemed constitutionally adequate in a civil or criminal
                            proceeding; that is, notice must be given the juvenile and his parents sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare, and the notice must set forth the alleged misconduct
                            with particularity. (4) In juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile’s freedom is curtailed, the child and his parents must be notified of the child’s
                            right to counsel and, if unable to afford counsel, to the appointment of same. (5) Juvenile proceedings to determine delinquency, as a result of which the juvenile may be committed to a State institution, must be regarded as
                            “criminal” for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. V, the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege applies in juvenile proceedings the same as in adult criminal cases. In re Burrus,

                            be determined by a jury. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879, 1969 N.C. LEXIS 435 (1969), aff'd, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971).

                            The presiding judge in a juvenile proceeding that could lead to detention should not assume the role of prosecuting attorney where the juvenile is represented by counsel and the hearing is adversary in nature. Such procedure would clearly violate due
                            process in adult criminal prosecutions, nor would a dual role of judge and prosecutor measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment in juvenile proceedings where detention could result. In re Thomas,

                        It is the duty of the trial judge in carrying out the requirements of this section to give each child individual attention, as it is impossible for the judge to determine that the admission is a product of informed choice without making the required inquiries

                    <p>
                        In a juvenile proceedings, the trial court erred in accepting defendant’s admission because the trial court failed to inquire whether defendant was satisfied with his representation, as required by G.S. 7B-2407(a), and the error was not harmless. In re
                        T.E.F., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 604 S.E.2d 348, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2060 (2004), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 570</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 296, 2005

                        Addressing each of the six issues listed in G.S. 7B-2407(a) is mandatory and a “totality of the circumstances” standard of review is inapplicable; thus, a trial court committed reversible error in taking an admission from a juvenile in an adjudicatory
                        hearing without specifically asking the juvenile if he was satisfied with his counsel as was required by G.S. 7B-2407(a). In re T.E.F., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 570</cite>, 614 S.E.2d 296, 2005 N.C.

                        Trial court’s adjudication and disposition orders were reversed where there was no indication that it had informed a juvenile of his right to remain silent and the risk that any statements may be used against him or of his right to deny the allegations
                        and as a result, it had failed to cover all of the six steps listed in G.S. 7B-2407(a). In re A.W., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 641 S.E.2d 354, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 473 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Since the State failed to provide information in compliance with G.S. 7B-2407 to establish a factual basis for admitting defendant, a juvenile’s, plea, as the prosecutor’s statement of facts did not contain any statement or evidence that the pickup truck
                        was worth more than $1,000, and the record included no written statement of defendant or sworn testimony or a statement of facts by his attorney that indicated that the truck was valued at more than $1,000, defendant’s admission
                        of guilt as to the stolen vehicle had to be vacated. In re D.C., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 662 S.E.2d 570, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1189 (2008).

                        Juvenile adjudication was reversed because, inter alia, the trial court erred by failing to inform defendant of most restrictive disposition on charge before accepting his admission.

                        raised the disposition without sufficient notice to the juvenile or any accompanying chance to withdraw the admission. In re J.G., 2021-NCCOA-613, 867 S.E.2d 351, 2021- NCCOA-613, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 625 (Ct. App. 2021).

                        The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal rules of evidence, G.S. 8C-1, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court
                        could properly consider written psychological reports in determining, on motion brought by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34, whether the needs of children would be best served by modification
                        of its previous orders concerning visitation. In re Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 336 S.E.2d 136, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4394 (1985).

                        The proper quantum of proof in a juvenile hearing to determine delinquency is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 232 S.E.2d 486, <cite class="nc_code">1977 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1981 (1977) (decided under former G.S. 7A-285).

                        In a juvenile adjudicatory hearing, the respondent is entitled to have the evidence evaluated by the same standards as apply in criminal proceedings against adults. The State, therefore, must present substantial evidence of each essential element of the
                        offense charged and of respondent’s being the perpetrator. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2633 (1986).

                        Adjudication order contained an ambiguity that could not be resolved as to the standard of proof used for purposes of G.S. 7B-2409 and G.S. 7B-2411 because in its findings after a juvenile delinquency adjudication hearing, the trial court correctly stated
                        the burden of proof as proof proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but in the portion of the order that referenced an assault inflicting serious injury, a clear, cogent and convincing evidence burden of proof was stated. In re C.B.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 654 S.E.2d 21, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2521 (2007).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in failing to adjudicate a juvenile delinquent based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt because the adjudication order stated that the facts were proven beyond a reasonable doubt; although the trial court ultimately determines
                        the existence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a respondent’s guilt, in considering a motion to dismiss, the evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the State. In re S.M., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>                        579, 660 S.E.2d 653, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 992 (2008).

                        The statutory use of “shall” is a mandate to trial judges requiring them to affirmatively state that the allegations of the juvenile petition are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to follow the mandate of the statute is error. In re Wade,
                        <cite

                        It is reversible error for a trial court to fail to state affirmatively that an adjudication of delinquency is based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 348 S.E.2d 823,
                        <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2633 (1986).

                        The order of the trial judge must affirmatively state that the allegations are proved beyond a reasonable doubt, even in cases where the juvenile admits the offense alleged. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite>                        336, 352 S.E.2d 889, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2500 (1987).

                        The statutory use of the word “shall” mandates trial judges to affirmatively state that the reasonable doubt standard was followed. Failure of the trial judge to follow the clear mandate of the statute is error. In re Mitchell,

                        Case was remanded for clarification of the standard of proof used in the order adjudicating a juvenile defendant delinquent for committing indecent liberties between children, in violation of G.S. 14-202.2, because the trial court did not unequivocally

                        was sufficient to satisfy the G.S. 7B-2411 requirement that the finding be stated; G.S. 7B-2512 required the findings in the dispositional order, but not the adjudicatory order, to be in writing. In re Rikard,

                        A trial court’s failure to state the standard of proof used in making a determination of abuse or neglect constitutes error. However, because no appeal was taken or other relief sought from trial court’s failure to state the standard of proof used in
                        an order adjudging respondent’s children abused and neglected, it remained a valid final order which was binding in a later proceeding on the facts.

                        The trial court did not err by concluding that petitioner was authorized to file petition to terminate parental rights, nor by ruling that the parties were estopped from relitigating abuse and neglect issues decided in previous proceeding in which respondent
                        was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent
                        the opportunity to present evidence relevant to these issues, but merely prohibited the parties from relitigating whether respondent had, in fact, sexually abused his children. In re Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite>                        189, 360 S.E.2d 458, <cite class="nc_code">19<cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite></cite> LEXIS 3124 (1987).

                        Trial court met the requirements of former G.S.7A-635 (see now this section) and former G.S. 7A-637 (see now G.S. 7B-807 and G.S. 7B-2410) by stating the standard used at the adjudication stage of the proceeding; he was not also required to recite that
                        his decision at the disposition stage of the proceeding was discretionary. Clark v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 373 S.E.2d 317, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 917 (1988).

                    <p>
                        The evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support its findings of abuse and neglect where: (1) Child, while in respondent’s sole care, suffered multiple burns over a wide portion of her body; (2) no accidental cause was established, and the
                        child in fact stated that respondent burned her; (3) the burns were serious, requiring prompt medical attention; (4) respondent did not seek treatment for the child’s injuries and refused to permit social worker to do so; and (5)
                        the child was taken for treatment only upon the intervention of the sheriff’s department, over respondent’s opposition. In re Hayden, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C.

                        A finding of neglect by clear and convincing evidence was proper where the children were kept at home, and they did not receive proper medical care, supervision, or adequate nutrition.

                        was found to have sexually abused his children, where the trial court did not rely solely upon the previous order in a way that would have impermissibly predetermined the outcome of the termination hearing, and did not deny respondent

                    as any factors indicating the probability of the juvenile committing further delinquent acts, shall be conducted for the juvenile and shall be attached to the predisposition report. In cases where no predisposition report is available
                    and the court makes a written finding that a report is not needed, the court may proceed with the dispositional hearing. No predisposition report or risk and needs assessment of any child alleged to be delinquent or undisciplined shall
                    be made prior to an adjudication that the juvenile is within the juvenile jurisdiction of the court unless the juvenile, the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or custodian, or the juvenile’s attorney files a written statement with the juvenile
                    court counselor granting permission and giving consent to the predisposition report or risk and needs assessment. No predisposition report shall be submitted to or considered by the court prior to the completion of the adjudicatory
                    hearing. The court shall permit the juvenile to inspect any predisposition report, including any attached risk and needs assessment, to be considered by the court in making the disposition unless the court determines that disclosure
                    would seriously harm the juvenile’s treatment or rehabilitation or would violate a promise of confidentiality. Opportunity to offer evidence in rebuttal shall be afforded the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or custodian
                    at the dispositional hearing. The court may order counsel not to disclose parts of the report to the juvenile or the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or custodian if the court finds that disclosure would seriously harm the treatment or
                    rehabilitation of the juvenile or would violate a promise of confidentiality given to a source of information.

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering juvenile into custody and continuing his disposition hearing with regard to charges of breaking and entering, trespass, and injury to real property, because a fourth charge arose during the juvenile’s
                        adjudication hearing as he was seen by a court counselor mouthing the words “I’m going to kick your ass” to a witness who had just testified against him; therefore, the State was entitled to more time to prepare since the fourth
                        charge of intimidating a witness was added. In re R.D.R., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 623 S.E.2d 341, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 52 (2006).

                        such a continuance. This is particularly so in light of the provision of former G.S. 7A-632 (see now G.S. 7B-803 and 7B-2406) that “The judge may continue at any time any case to allow additional factual evidence, social information

                        contained much of the information contemplated by G.S. 7B-2413, including information regarding defendant’s court history, social, medical, psychiatric, psychological, and educational history, psychiatric diagnoses and prescriptions,

                        Where there was only a determination of probable cause in a hearing before the district court, even though the district court order referred to the hearing as having been adjudicatory and dispositional, the juveniles were not placed in jeopardy by the
                        hearing in the district court before the case’s transfer to the superior court. In re Bullard, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 206 S.E.2d 305, <cite class="nc_code">1974 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        the crime’s seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable was considered, findings of the juvenile’s adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for

                        Whenever the trial court is determining the best interest of a child, any evidence which is competent and relevant to a showing of the best interest of that child must be heard and considered by the trial court, subject to the discretionary powers of
                        the trial court to exclude cumulative testimony. Without hearing and considering such evidence, the trial court cannot make an informed and intelligent decision concerning the best interest of the child. In re Shue,

                        At a dispositional hearing the trial judge is not restricted to consideration of only those acts for which there had been an adjudication. If the information presented is determined by the trial judge to be reliable, accurate and competently obtained,
                        he may properly consider it. In re Bullabough, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 171, 365 S.E.2d 642, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 279 (1988).

                        Trial court properly determined a juvenile’s delinquency history points, pursuant to G.S. 7B-2507(f), because the juvenile stipulated to the court counselor’s report, which listed the juvenile’s prior adjudications, as the juvenile’s attorney received

                        The clear intent of the legislature is that a hearing upon a motion for review is in the nature of a dispositional hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing, and that the formal Rules of Evidence, G.S. 8C-1, do not apply. Therefore, the trial court
                        could properly consider written psychological reports in determining on motion brought by parents whose parental rights had been terminated under former G.S. 7A-289.34 (see now 7B-1113), whether the needs of children would be best

                        Trial courts giving consideration at a dispositional hearing to unadjudicated acts allegedly committed by a juvenile, unrelated to that for which he stands petitioned, must first determine that such information is reliable and accurate and that it was

                        The trial court did not deny the parents of a juvenile their right to “present evidence” and “advise the court concerning the disposition they believe to be in the best interests of the juvenile” when, after they were tendered to the trial court, the
                        trial court did not question them; the trial court’s decision not to question them did not constitute a refusal to allow them to present evidence or to advise the trial court regarding the appropriate disposition. In re Powers,

                        Assuming arguendo that defendant juvenile was correct in the defendant’s contention that the trial court decided the terms of the defendant’s disposition prior to allowing the defendant’s mother to be heard, the error was harmless based on the fact that

                        Findings of fact in a dispositional order in a delinquency case did not support a trial court’s decision to transfer custody of defendant from his mother to his father, and that part of the dispositional order was reversed where the evidence in the record
                        failed to support a finding that placement with the father was in defendant’s best interests; the record indicated that defendant had no contact with his father for approximately seven to eight months immediately prior to the assault
                        for which defendant was on trial, the court counselor did not recommend placement with the father and instead advised the court to utilize family services if defendant needed more structure during the day, and it appeared that
                        the trial court based the decision to award custody to the father solely on defendant’s school absences. In re Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 589 S.E.2d 894, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 8 (2004).

                        Where juvenile defendant was adjudicated delinquent for having committed assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and defendant’s delinquency history level was determined to have been low, the trial court had the authority to impose either
                        a level 2 or level 3 disposition, and it was within the trial court’s discretion to determine which dispositional alternative to impose; where defendant failed to return to school at the end of her five-day suspension, was absent
                        from school for more than 100 days, and where the record revealed that the trial court had before it undisputed evidence that both defendant and her mother knew that defendant was eligible to return to school after the five-day
                        suspension, but were unable to offer an explanation for defendant’s failure to return to school, defendant failed to show that the trial court’s decision to impose a level 3 disposition amounted to an abuse of discretion. In re

                        to learn the significance of victimizing people and the consequences of that, sufficiently addressed the first two G.S. 7B-2501(c) factors, it did not consider the last three factors, including the importance of protecting the

                        the crime’s seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable was considered, findings of the juvenile’s adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for
                        fighting showed public protection was considered, findings of how the juvenile violated probation showed degree of culpability was considered, and finding the juvenile’s failure to obtain treatment showed treatment needs were considered.

                    institutionalization after it is recommended by the area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse director, the signature and consent of the court may be substituted for that purpose. In all cases in which a regional
                    mental hospital refuses admission to a juvenile referred for admission by the court and an area mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse director or discharges a juvenile previously admitted on court referral
                    prior to completion of the juvenile’s treatment, the hospital shall submit to the court a written report setting out the reasons for denial of admission or discharge and setting out the juvenile’s diagnosis, indications of mental illness,
                    indications of need for treatment, and a statement as to the location of any facility known to have a treatment program for the juvenile in question.” For effective date and applicability, see editor’s note.

                        As the General Assembly recognized the need for participation by counties in the dispositional stage of a juvenile proceedings it amended subsection (3) of former G.S. 7A-286 to require the trial judge to notify a representative of the county and provide
                        the representative an opportunity to be heard at a juvenile’s dispositional hearing. In re D.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 488 S.E.2d 842, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 804 (1997).

                    <p>
                        The provision in subsection (6) of former G.S. 7A-286 that a juvenile judge may not commit a child directly to a mental institution was clearly designed to prevent conflicts with various statutes under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite>.
                        In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2019 (1976).

                        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutional defense, procedural, and evidentiary rules. To allow juvenile judges to commit minors to
                        mental institutions with a lesser standard than that set forth in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> would subject such commitments to constitutional challenge
                        as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2019 (1976).

                        “Cost of care” does not include counsel fees for juvenile, which are governed by former G.S. 7A-588 (see now G.S. 7B-603 and 7B-2002). In re Wharton, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 283 S.E.2d 528, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                        Prior to committing a juvenile to the Division of Youth Services, the court must also consider any reasonable and available nonstatutory community-level alternatives. In re Mosser, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 523,

                        Level 2 intermediate disposition was proper in a juvenile case pursuant to G.S. 7B-2508(f) because appellant had 1 point for prior offenses and had a serious offense combined with a low delinquency level; ordered intermediate disposition, that appellant
                        participate in a wilderness program, submit to intermittent confinement of 14 days in an approved detention facility, and perform 50 hours of community service, was within the range of statutorily permissible dispositions, and
                        this decision was not manifestly unsupported by reason and within the discretion of the trial court. In re K.L.D., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 709 S.E.2d 409, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 598 (2011).

                        Trial court erred in failing to refer the defendant juvenile to the area mental health services director; the predisposition report referred to a clinical assessment, which diagnosed the juvenile with conduct disorder and recommended intensive outpatient
                        services. In re E.A., <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. App.</cite> 396, 833 S.E.2d 630, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 759 (2019).

                        Trial court erred in failing to refer a juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action, as required by statute, before committing her to a youth development center (YDC) because the trial court was faced with evidence that
                        the juvenile was mentally ill, the juvenile demonstrated a reasonable possibility that compliance with the statute and review of the required evaluation would have resulted in a different disposition, and the trial court lacked
                        the opportunity to weigh any mental health care clinicians’ reasoning against the State’s recommendation for commitment to a YDC. In re A.L.B., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 849 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Where finding that juvenile was manic-depressive was supported only by a statement made to trial court by mother of the juvenile, this evidence of mental illness compelled further inquiry by trial court prior to entry of any final disposition; however,
                        while trial court had authority to order a psychiatric examination of juvenile and gain advice of a medical specialist, he failed to utilize this community resource and such failure precludes commitment to the Division of Youth
                        Services. In re Mosser, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 393 S.E.2d 308, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 528 (1990).

                        Trial court erred in committing defendant to a youth development center and transferring his legal custody to the county department of social services because it failed to refer defendant to the area mental health services director after being presented
                        with evidence that he was mentally ill, as required by statute; the trial court was presented with a plethora of evidence demonstrating that defendant was mentally ill. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite>                        476, 823 S.E.2d 674, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 58 (2019).

                        Use of the word “shall” indicates a statutory mandate that the trial court refer the juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action, and failure to do so is error; faced with any amount of evidence that a juvenile is mentally
                        ill, a trial court has a statutory duty to refer the juvenile to the area mental health services director for appropriate action. In re E.M., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 823 S.E.2d 674,

                        As the General Assembly recognized the need for participation by counties in the dispositional stage of a juvenile proceedings it amended subsection (3) of former G.S. 7A-286 to require the trial judge to notify a representative of the county and provide
                        the representative an opportunity to be heard at a juvenile’s dispositional hearing. In re D.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 296, 488 S.E.2d 842, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 804 (1997).

                        The provision in subsection (6) of former G.S. 7A-286 that a juvenile judge may not commit a child directly to a mental institution was clearly designed to prevent conflicts with various statutes under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite>.

                        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutional defense, procedural, and evidentiary rules. To allow juvenile judges to commit minors to
                        mental institutions with a lesser standard than that set forth in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> would subject such commitments to constitutional challenge
                        as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2019 (1976).

                        “Cost of care” does not include counsel fees for juvenile, which are governed by former G.S. 7A-588 (see now G.S. 7B-603 and 7B-2002). In re Wharton, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 283 S.E.2d 528, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C.

                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,

                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                        the juvenile was mentally ill, the juvenile demonstrated a reasonable possibility that compliance with the statute and review of the required evaluation would have resulted in a different disposition, and the trial court lacked

                        Where finding that juvenile was manic-depressive was supported only by a statement made to trial court by mother of the juvenile, this evidence of mental illness compelled further inquiry by trial court prior to entry of any final disposition; however,
                        while trial court had authority to order a psychiatric examination of juvenile and gain advice of a medical specialist, he failed to utilize this community resource and such failure precludes commitment to the Division of Youth

                            <li id="t7BsIIa25s7B-2503ol11a">

                                to the parent, guardian, or custodian or the juvenile as the judge may specify.

                        There is no authorization in the statutes to grant legal and physical custody of a juvenile to the Willie M. Services Section of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services, although juvenile’s guardian ad litem
                        argued that the Division of Youth Services, also a Division of the Department of Human Resources, is a “person” within the purview of former G.S. 7A-647. In re Autry, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite>                        263, 444 S.E.2d 239, <cite class="nc_code">1994 N.C.

                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                        Trial court erred in entering a dispositional order that directed the juvenile to cooperate with placement in a residential treatment facility “if deemed necessary” by either of two counselors as statutory law did not give the trial court authority to
                        delegate its authority in entering a dispositional order. In re Hartsock, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 580 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1043 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Because a trial court ordered a juvenile defendant to pay restitution and participate in a residential treatment program, it did not impermissibly delegate authority; instead, defendant was ordered to pay restitution, but the amount was left to be determined
                        until the victim’s medical bills were provided to the trial court, which comported with G.S. 7B-2506. In re M.A.B., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 611 S.E.2d 886, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 894 (2005).

                        Rule that a trial court may not delegate or vest its discretion in another person or entity applies to a trial court’s order of probation pursuant to G.S. 7B-2506(8) and the underlying conditions of that term of probation, which are governed by G.S. 7B-2510;
                        special conditions of probation that respondent juvenile cooperate with any out-of-home placement if deemed necessary by the court counselor and that he cooperate with any counseling or assessment recommended by the court counselor
                        were impermissible delegations of the trial court’s authority. In re S.R.S., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 636 S.E.2d 277, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2233 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not improperly delegate its authority to a third party because it exercised its discretion in implementing probationary conditions; the trial court selected community dispositions within the allowed subdivisions permitted by the Level
                        1 designation, and it and did not delegate decisions on whether to enforce them to a third party but instead, directed the court counselor and parents to handle the day-to-day implementation of the particular probationary conditions.

                        There is no authorization in the statutes to grant legal and physical custody of a juvenile to the Willie M. Services Section of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services, although juvenile’s guardian ad litem

                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,

                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                        When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by G.S. 7B-2510, and was authorized to order a new disposition at Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an

                        Although the trial court had the authority to order that the juvenile be confined on an intermittent basis in an approved detention facility, statutory law required that the timing of the confinement be determined by the trial court in its discretion
                        and the applicable form left space for instruction as to that timing; the trial court erred in not filling in the timing since it left the space blank and, thus, that portion of the disposition order was incomplete and had no effect.

                        Generally. —  The delinquency history level for a delinquent juvenile is determined by calculating the sum of the points assigned to each of the juvenile’s prior adjudications or convictions and to the juvenile’s probation status, if any, that the court
                        finds to have been proved in accordance with this section. For the purposes of this section, a prior adjudication is an adjudication of an offense that occurs before the adjudication of the offense before the court.

                    The State bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a prior adjudication or conviction exists and that the juvenile before the court is the same person as the juvenile named in the prior adjudication or conviction. The original
                    or a copy of the court records or a copy of the records maintained by the Department of Public Safety or of the Division, bearing the same name as that by which the juvenile is charged, is prima facie evidence that the juvenile named
                    is the same person as the juvenile before the court, and that the facts set out in the record are true. For purposes of this subsection, “a copy” includes a paper writing containing a reproduction of a record maintained electronically
                    on a computer or other data processing equipment, and a document produced by a facsimile machine. The prosecutor shall make all feasible efforts to obtain and present to the court the juvenile’s full record. Evidence presented by either
                    party at trial may be utilized to prove prior adjudications or convictions. If asked by the juvenile, the prosecutor shall furnish the juvenile’s prior adjudications or convictions to the juvenile within a reasonable time sufficient
                    to allow the juvenile to determine if the record available to the prosecutor is accurate.

                        Where juvenile defendant was adjudicated delinquent for having committed assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and defendant’s delinquency history level was determined to have been low, the trial court had the authority to impose either
                        a level 2 or level 3 disposition, and it was within the trial court’s discretion to determine which dispostional alternative to impose; where defendant failed to return to school at the end of her five-day suspension, was absent

                        It was error to deny a juvenile’s motion to modify the juvenile’s disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not on probation, so the court had no

                        sexual interest in younger children, that he might reoffend, and that rape might sexually excite him, and an evaluation which stated that appellant might be more suitable for treatment in a secure environment and that he should

                        Order entering a level 3 disposition and commitment order based on a juvenile’s violation of probation was error because it was undisputed that underlying offense was classified as a minor offense under G.S. 7B-2508, and the plain language of G.S. 7B-2510(f)
                        specifically prohibited the entry of a new disposition at level 3; G.S. 7B-2508(g) did not require a different result. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C.

                        It was error to deny a juvenile’s motion to modify the juvenile’s disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not on probation, so the court had no
                        authority to impose a level 3 disposition. In re A.F., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 752 S.E.2d 245, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1316 (2013).

                        Accordingly, the trial court’s disposition and commitment orders were vacated, and the case was remanded for the entry of a single disposition order.

                        When a trial court found that a juvenile appellant violated his probation, it was governed by G.S. 7B-2510, and was authorized to order a new disposition at Level 2, the next higher level from the original disposition at Level 1; commitment was not an

                        Trial court did not err in reinstating a juvenile’s sentence after she violated the terms of her probation because the trial court was authorized to activate a juvenile’s suspended fourteen-day sentence and impose an additional suspended fourteen-day

                        G.S. 15-196.1, which allows for defendants to receive credit for time served in confinement prior to final disposition, is inapplicable to juvenile matters, and a term of juvenile confinement, therefore, may not be reduced by time spent in court-ordered

                        Where respondent juvenile was initially placed on probation as an “undisciplined” child for unlawful absence from school, and his probation was continued when he was adjudicated a delinquent for damage to property by shooting out the windows and screens
                        of a home with an air rifle and again when he was adjudicated a delinquent for stealing $60.00 from a purse, his probationary status resulted from delinquent behavior rather than merely from the undisciplined behavior upon which
                        it was initially grounded, and the juvenile court had authority to commit respondent to the custody of the Division of Youth Services for placement in one of its residential facilities upon finding respondent in violation of the
                        conditions of his probation subsequent to the adjudications that he was delinquent. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C.

                        When a juvenile admitted a violation of his probation due to being physically aggressive with another juvenile, the double jeopardy clause did not preclude his subsequent delinquency adjudication based on that behavior, as double jeopardy did not apply
                        to his probation revocation hearing; any punishment to which he was exposed by virtue of that hearing was punishment for the offense for which he was originally placed on probation, rather than punishment for the offense on which
                        his probation violation was based, so he was not being punished twice for the same offense. In re O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 585 S.E.2d 478, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1789 (2003).

                        allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 631 S.E.2d 857, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1562 (2006).

                        Where a juvenile’s court supervision was revoked for probation violations, it was not error to fail to make the specific inquiries enumerated in G.S. 7B-2407, because G.S. 7B-2407 did not apply to the juvenile’s admission, or admissions by the juvenile
                        through the juvenile’s attorney, that the juvenile violated conditions of court supervision. In re D.J.M., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 126, 638 S.E.2d 610, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 68 (2007).

                        Trial court did not err in reinstating a juvenile’s sentence after she violated the terms of her probation because the trial court was authorized to activate a juvenile’s suspended fourteen-day sentence and impose an additional suspended fourteen-day
                        period of confinement based on the juvenile’s admitted probation violation at another hearing, for a total of twenty-eight days confinement, and the trial court’s findings of fact were sufficient to support the extension of juvenile’s
                        probation; pursuant to G.S. 7B-2510(e) and G.S. 7B-2506 and -2508, a trial court can impose up to and no more than twenty-eight days confinement in an approved juvenile detention facility for a Level 2 disposition. In re D.L.H.,

                        Trial court did not err in finding that the juvenile had willfully violated the terms and conditions of his probation because, since he had been placed on probation, defendant had had numerous unexcused absences from school and had violated school rules
                        by communicating threats to a teacher; and, even if the trial court erred in finding that the juvenile had the ability to control his behavior and did not willfully violate the school rules when he communicated threats to a teacher,
                        that fact had no bearing on the extent to which he was willfully absent from school without a valid excuse on numerous occasions in violation of his probation.

                        G.S. 15-196.1, which allows for defendants to receive credit for time served in confinement prior to final disposition, is inapplicable to juvenile matters, and a term of juvenile confinement, therefore, may not be reduced by time spent in court-ordered

                        Order entering a level 3 disposition and commitment order based on a juvenile’s violation of probation was error because it was undisputed that underlying offense was classified as a minor offense under G.S. 7B-2508, and the plain language of G.S. 7B-2510(f)
                        specifically prohibited the entry of a new disposition at level 3; G.S. 7B-2508(g) did not require a different result. In re S.B., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C.

                        could subject the juvenile to a level 3 disposition and concession of the existence of the challenged delinquency history points before entry of the contested disposition did not expressly extend the juvenile’s probation because

                        allowable Level 2 disposition, so the trial court was not authorized to impose commitment, stayed or unstayed. In re T.B., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 631 S.E.2d 857, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1562 (2006).

                        Findings of fact in a dispositional order in a delinquency case did not support a trial court’s decision to transfer custody of defendant from his mother to his father, and that part of the dispositional order was reversed where the evidence in the record
                        failed to support a finding that placement with the father was in defendant’s best interests; the record indicated that defendant had no contact with his father for approximately seven to eight months immediately prior to the assault
                        for which defendant was on trial, the court counselor did not recommend placement with the father and instead advised the court to utilize family services if defendant needed more structure during the day, and it appeared that
                        the trial court based the decision to award custody to the father solely on defendant’s school absences. In re Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 589 S.E.2d 894, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 8 (2004).

                        the mother having a realistic chance to regain custody were prejudicial error, and the part of the court’s order retaining jurisdiction was, therefore, vacated.

                        Findings that a juvenile defendant violated his release conditions based upon his failure to comply with the rules and regulations of his group home, and that the violations were without just cause or legal dispute were sufficient to support the trial
                        court’s revocation of defendant’s post-release supervision pursuant to G.S. 7B-2516; because a conditional release from the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention was not the same as probation or final discharge,
                        the requisite findings and conclusions contained in a dispositional order pursuant to G.S. 7B-2512 were not applicable. Once defendant’s post-release supervision was revoked, return to the Youth Development Center was mandated

                        the crime’s seriousness was considered, findings of repeated probation violations showed a need to hold the juvenile accountable was considered, findings of the juvenile’s adjudication for armed robbery and school suspension for

                        This section allows a trial court to commit a juvenile for the maximum period of time that any adult could be committed for the same offense, without considering prior record levels and aggravating/mitigating factors as required under structured sentencing
                        for adults; this interpretation is supported by the purpose of disposition in juvenile actions and the amendment effective December 1, 1996. In re Carter, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 140,

                    <p>
                        There is a rational basis for the legislature’s disparate treatment of adults and children, and, therefore, this section was not unconstitutionally applied to a juvenile in derogation of her equal protection rights, notwithstanding that she was committed
                        to the custody of the state for longer than the period for which an adult could have been imprisoned for her conduct, i.e., unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.

                        Where judge held no dispositional hearing, and denied juvenile the opportunity to present evidence as to disposition, and there was no evidence to support the findings made by the judge with respect to disposition, the commitment order would be reversed
                        so that the court could conduct a dispositional hearing. In re Lail, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 238, 284 S.E.2d 731, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2986 (1981).

                        Consecutive commitments are not contrary to the philosophy of the Juvenile Code. Such reasoning would mean that once a juvenile had been committed to a detention facility or training school (now youth development center) he would be free to commit whatever
                        other illegal acts he so chose, knowing that he could not receive any additional punishment for his action. This was not the intention of the legislature when it adopted the Juvenile Code. In re Thompson,

                        The Juvenile Code does not contain any provision which prohibits the commitment of a juvenile to consecutive terms of detention. Absent an express prohibition, the common-law rule that the courts have the authority to commit offenders to consecutive terms
                        of confinement is controlling. In re Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 327 S.E.2d 908, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3428 (1985).

                        Judge had affirmative obligation to inquire into and to seriously consider merits of alternative dispositions; therefore, his failure to do so was error, even though court counselor failed to inform judge of any programs that might be appropriate for
                        child. Judge did not consider any of the broad range of community-level alternatives (except probation) listed in former G.S. 7A-647, 7A-648, or 7A-649 of the Juvenile Code, and although child’s attorney offered several examples
                        of appropriate alternative programs, judge apparently failed to entertain these, simply accepting as dispositive court counselor’s statement that drug rehabilitation program was available. In re Groves,

                        It is within the discretion of the trial court to commit a juvenile to the Division of Youth Services, and there is no requirement that a recommendation for training school (now youth development center) be made before a commitment is ordered. In re Molina,

        Nature of Conditional Release. —

                        A conditional release from the Division of Youth Services is not the same as probation or final discharge. A juvenile on conditional release is still technically subject to the original order committing him to the Division of Youth Services, which is
                        the basis of whatever restrictions on his activity might be deemed appropriate as aftercare supervision. In re Baxley, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 328 S.E.2d 831, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 3498 (1985).

                    <p>
                        When a juvenile judge revokes a conditional release, the previous order provides authority for recommittal to the Division of Youth Services; no new order with the findings required by former G.S. 7A-652 is necessary. In re Baxley,

                        In view of the fact that the relevant statutory language clearly and unambiguously requires that the notice of the proposed extension provided to the juvenile and his or her parents be in writing, it must be construed using its plain meaning; since the

                        Given that nothing in subsection (a) authorizes the courts to overlook the existence of deficient notice based on any failure on defendant juvenile’s part to making a showing of actual prejudice, the court of appeals lacked explicit statutory authority
                        to absolve the State from the failure of the Division of Juvenile Justice to comply with the notice requirements. In re J.L.H., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C.

                        Trial court erred in denying defendant juvenile’s motion to be released from commitment because the Division of Juvenile Justice failed to comply with the notice requirement, and the provision of adequate notice had a direct impact upon the ability of
                        defendant and his parents to contest the extension; no written notice of the final extension decision was provided to defendant or his father until the date upon which the Division officially approved the recommendation. In re

                        Findings that a juvenile defendant violated his release conditions based upon his failure to comply with the rules and regulations of his group home, and that the violations were without just cause or legal dispute were sufficient to support the trial
                        court’s revocation of defendant’s post-release supervision pursuant to G.S. 7B-2516; because a conditional release from the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention was not the same as probation or final discharge,
                        the requisite findings and conclusions contained in a dispositional order pursuant to G.S. 7B-2512 were not applicable. Once defendant’s post-release supervision was revoked, return to the Youth Development Center was mandated

                        school without an excuse and was suspended for the remainder of the school year, both of which were conditions of the juvenile’s post-release supervision. In re A.J.

                        A decree of custody is entitled to such stability as would end the vicious litigation so often accompanying such contests, unless it be found that some change of circumstances has occurred affecting the welfare of the child so as to require modification

                        Where court had previously deemed it in the best interest of minor children who had been adjudicated neglected that mother comply with certain orders of the court, the court acted with full statutory authority when it later conducted a hearing upon social
                        worker’s subsequent motion and determined that mother’s refusal to cooperate with community-level services and orders applicable to her constituted a “change of circumstances” affecting the best interest of the children, sufficient

                        It was error to deny a juvenile’s motion to modify the juvenile’s disposition because the court wrongly assigned two delinquency history points for being on probation at the time of an offense when the juvenile was not on probation, so the court had no

                        has been entered and not withdrawn, the clerk shall transfer the case to the superior court docket. The superior court shall, within a reasonable time, review the record of the transfer hearing for abuse of discretion by the juvenile

                        A finding of probable cause in a juvenile proceeding was not an appealable “final order” under former G.S. 7A-666 (see now this section), and evidentiary rulings of the trial court in conducting the probable cause hearing were not properly before the
                        Court of Appeals for review. In re Ford, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 272 S.E.2d 157, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3425 (1980).

                        An adjudication of delinquency is not a final order. No appeal may be taken from such order unless no disposition is made within 60 days of the adjudication of delinquency.

                        engaged in a de novo review by making findings on the evidence relating to the factors set forth in G.S. 7B-2203(b); the superior court did not explain in what way the district court’s decision was manifestly unreasonable but simply

                        Former G.S. 7A-289, permitting the district court to enter a temporary custody order affecting a juvenile who is appealing a commitment order of the court, was not unconstitutional on the ground that the statute deprived the juvenile of the right to bail.

                        ordered pursuant to this subsection, the court may order the parent to receive evaluation or treatment currently available from the area mental health program that serves the parent’s catchment area.

                        Support payments ordered pursuant to former G.S. 7A-650(c) should be based on the interplay of the trial court’s conclusions as to the amount of support necessary to meet the needs of the child and the ability of the parents to provide that amount. The
                        court’s conclusions should in turn be based on findings of fact sufficiently specific to show that the court gave due regard to the relevant factors in G.S. 50-13.4(c) and any other relevant factors of the particular case. When
                        such findings are not made, the order should be vacated, because appellate courts have no means of determining whether the order is supported by the evidence and is based on the proper considerations. In re Botsford,

                        Trial court abused its discretion by denying a juvenile the right to examine his records under G.S. 7B-2901(b) because G.S. 7B-2901(b) gave the juvenile the right to examine his county department of social services files and mental health records; the
                        trial court deemed which portions of the juvenile’s record were irrelevant or cumulative and ordered those portions sealed. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 605, 685 S.E.2d 11,

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                        give the juvenile an opportunity to gather evidence for his disposition hearing. In re J.L., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 605, 685 S.E.2d 11, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

        Cross-Examination of Defendant as to Prior Adjudications of Delinquency. —

                    <p>
                        For purposes of impeachment, it is permissible to cross-examine a juvenile defendant with reference to his prior convictions or adjudications of guilt of prior conduct which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a conviction of crime. State
                        v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a criminal case, the rule that when a defendant takes the stand he may be impeached by cross-examination with respect to previous convictions of crime applies to every defendant who takes the stand, regardless of his age at the time of his previous
                        conviction. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 70</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 729, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1006 (1972) (decided under former G.S. 7A-287).

                        Former G.S. 7A-677(b) is in line with the general rule that a defendant who takes the stand may be cross-examined for impeachment purposes about prior convictions. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>, 320 S.E.2d
                        670, 1984 N.C. LEXIS 1778 (1984).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prosecutor’s tactic of reading from defendant’s juvenile petitions while cross-examining defendant is not to be commended, but it does not constitute prejudicial error. When a prosecutor is acting on a good faith belief in the reliability of his information,
                        he may press or “sift” the witness by further cross-examination when the witness denies that he committed the crimes or bad acts that are the subject of the cross-examination. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>,
                        320 S.E.2d 670, 1984 N.C. LEXIS 1778 (1984).

                    <p>
                        A prosecutor may not, in cross-examining a defendant on collateral crimes, use questions which assume as facts unproved insinuations of the defendant’s guilt of collateral offenses. However, prosecutor was not making insinuations of unproven facts where
                        he based his questions concerning defendant’s prior convictions on juvenile petitions from proceedings in which defendant had been found to be delinquent. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 34</cite>,

       No Conflict with G.S. 90-21.5. —
      </b> G.S. 7B-3400, which provides that minors are subject to the supervision and control of their parents “notwithstanding any other provision of law,” does not abrogate or conflict with G.S. 90-21.5, which specifies the circumstances
                    under which minors can consent to health services. See opinion of Attorney General to Dr. David King, Chairman, Rowan Board of Health, 1999 N.C. AG LEXIS 27, 38 (8/25/99).

                    The provisions of this Article may be enforced by the parent, guardian, custodian, or person who has assumed the status and obligation of a parent without being awarded legal custody of the juvenile by a court to the juvenile by filing a civil action
                    in the district court of the county where the juvenile can be found or the county of the plaintiff’s residence. Upon the institution of such action by a verified complaint, alleging that the defendant juvenile has left home or has
                    left the place where the juvenile has been residing and refuses to return and comply with the direction and control of the plaintiff, the court may issue an order directing the juvenile personally to appear before the court at a specified
                    time to be heard in answer to the allegations of the plaintiff and to comply with further orders of the court. Such orders shall be served by the sheriff upon the juvenile and upon any other person named as a party defendant in such
                    action. At the time of the issuance of the order directing the juvenile to appear, the court may in the same order, or by separate order, order the sheriff to enter any house, building, structure, or conveyance for the purpose of searching
                    for the juvenile and serving the order and for the purpose of taking custody of the person of the juvenile in order to bring the juvenile before the court. Any order issued at said hearing shall be treated as a mandatory injunction
                    and shall remain in full force and effect until the juvenile reaches the age of 18, or until further orders of the court. Within 30 days after the hearing on the original order, the juvenile, or anyone acting in the juvenile’s behalf,
                    may file a verified answer to the complaint. Upon the filing of an answer by or on behalf of the juvenile, any district court judge holding court in the county or district court district as defined in G.S. 7A-133 where the action was
                    instituted shall have jurisdiction to hear the matter, without a jury, and to make findings of fact, conclusions of law, and render judgment thereon. Appeals from the district court to the Court of Appeals shall be allowed as in civil
                    actions generally. The district court issuing the original order or the district court hearing the matter after answer has been filed shall also have authority to order that any person named defendant in the order or judgment shall
                    not harbor, keep, or allow the defendant juvenile to remain on the person’s premises or in the person’s home. Failure of any defendant to comply with the terms of said order or judgment shall be punishable as for contempt.

                    The court, sitting without a jury, shall permit all parties to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The petitioner has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that emancipation is in the petitioner’s best interests. Upon finding
                    that reasonable cause exists, the court may order the juvenile to be examined by a psychiatrist, a licensed clinical psychologist, a physician, or any other expert to evaluate the juvenile’s mental or physical condition. The court
                    may continue the hearing and order investigation by a juvenile court counselor or by the county department of social services to substantiate allegations of the petitioner or respondents.

                        In a question of first impression, the appellate court held that, when the child of divorced parents left the custodial parent’s home to live on his own, but was not decreed by a court to be legally emancipated, the non-custodial parent’s obligation to
                        pay child support did not automatically terminate, because Article 35 of the Juvenile Code precluded the appellate court from accepting common law methods of emancipation for the purposes of terminating child support payments;
                        thus, the father’s child support obligations could not have automatically terminated absent a decree of emancipation. Morris v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. App.</cite> 496, 840 S.E.2d 223,

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in not holding the father in contempt as he did not intend to willfully violate the child support order because he was under the mistaken apprehension that he could simply stop paying after his son ceased living with the mother.

                    <p>
                        Because defendants, a child’s natural parents, were persons who sent the child to North Carolina for possible adoption by plaintiffs, they were the “sending agency” as that term is used in Article II(b) of the Compact, and as such, pursuant to Article
                        V, they retained jurisdiction, that is, authority or control over the child until his adoption, including the power to effect or cause the return of the child to their home state and “to determine all matters in relation to the
                        custody” of the child; therefore, the trial court properly determined that it had no jurisdiction over a custody proceeding brought by potential adoptive parents. Stancil v.

                    <p>
                        When, in a dependency proceeding, a trial court placed a child’s custody with the child’s foster parents without finding it was contrary to the child’s best interests to place her with willing relatives, pursuant to G.S. 7B-903(a)(2)c, this was error
                        because, inter alia, exempting review hearings from the requirement to first consider placement with relatives risked undermining the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), G.S. 7B-3800, as home studies of out-of-state
                        relatives required by the ICPC were often not completed until a review hearing was held. In re L.L., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 689, 616 S.E.2d 392, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1798 (2005).

                        violated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. In the Matter of V.A., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 727 S.E.2d 901, <cite class="nc_code">2012 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 873

                        Because the county department of human services (DHS) had not received notification of the proposed placement of the children from the appropriate Arizona agency prior to entry of the permanency planning order their aunt and uncle in Arizona, the trial
                        court was not authorized to award custody of the children to their aunt and uncle in Arizona; the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children required that Arizona notify DHS the proposed placement of the children did not appear

                    that the placement meets all applicable North Carolina placement statutes. Any sending agency that intends to place a child into and out of North Carolina shall submit a complete request to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of
                    Children office at the Department of Health and Human Services. To be considered a complete request, the submission must comply with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children regulations and include any supporting additional
                    information that the Department of Health and Human Services or the receiving state deems necessary. Unless otherwise provided by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children regulations, when the Department of Health and Human
                    Services receives an incomplete request, the Department of Health and Human Services shall provide either the sending agency in North Carolina or the receiving state with written notice of the specific information needed to process
                    the request and shall allow the sending agency 10 business days from the date of the notice to submit the requested information. If after the expiration of the 10 business days the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children office
                    at the Department of Health and Human Services does not receive the requested information or the sending agency does not withdraw its request, the request shall be deemed expired.

                                    shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council of the termination.The defaulting state is responsible
                                    for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.The Interstate
