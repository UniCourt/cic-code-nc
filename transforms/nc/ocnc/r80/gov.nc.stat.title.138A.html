       Recodification; Technical and Conforming Changes.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3, provides, in part: “The Revisor of Statutes shall recodify <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120C</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as well as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as amended by this act, into a new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> of the General Statutes to be entitled ‘Elections and Ethics Enforcement Act,’ as enacted by Section 4 of this act. The Revisor may also recodify into the new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> of the General Statutes other existing statutory laws relating to elections and ethics enforcement that are located elsewhere in the General Statutes as the Revisor deems appropriate.” The Revisor was further authorized to make additional technical and conforming changes to catchlines, internal citations, and other references throughout the General Statutes to effectuate this recodification, in consultation with the State Ethics Commission, the State Board of Elections, the Secretary of State, and the new Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(a), provides: “The Revisor of Statutes is authorized to re-recodify <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 163A</a></cite> of the General Statutes back into Chapters 163, 138A, and 120C of the General Statutes. In preparing the re-recodified chapters, the Revisor of Statutes shall revert the changes made by the Revisor pursuant to Section 3 of S.L. 2017-6, except that after consultation with the appropriate agency staff, the Revisor may separate subsections of statutory sections that existed in the former Chapters into new sections and, when necessary to organize relevant law into its proper place in the re-recodified chapters, may rearrange sentences that appeared within those subsections. The Revisor shall also incorporate into the re-recodified chapters all amendments to Chapters 163, 163A, 138A, and 120C that became effective on or after April 25, 2017, other than those made by S.L. 2017-6 or by Part VIII of S.L. 2018-2.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-146, s. 6.1, provides: “Consistent with this act, when re-recodifying as directed under this act, the Revisor is authorized to change all references to the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement to instead be references to the State Board of Elections, State Ethics Commission, or Secretary of State, as appropriate. The Revisor may modify statutory citations throughout the General Statutes, as appropriate, and may modify any references to statutory divisions, such as “Chapter,” “Subchapter,” “Article,” “Part,” “section,” and “subsection”; adjust the order of lists of multiple statutes to maintain statutory order; correct terms and conform names and titles changed by this act; eliminate duplicative references to the State Boards that result from the changes authorized by this section; and make conforming changes to catch lines and references to catch lines. The Revisor may also adjust subject and verb agreement and the placement of conjunctions. The Revisor shall consult with the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement, the State Board of Elections, the State Ethics Commission, and the Secretary of State, as appropriate, on this recodification.”

     </p>
     <p>
      This section was recodified as now former G.S. 163A-150 by Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3. Former G.S. 163A-150 was then re-recodified as this section by Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(a), effective January 31, 2019. The historical citation from the former section has been added to this section as re-recodified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2016-125, ss. 1 and 2, 4th Ex Sess., similarly recodified Chapters 120C, 138A, and 163 in a new Chapter. That new Chapter was designated as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>, and headings for new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>, Subchapter I, and Article 1 were enacted, along with new sections designated as G.S. 138B-1 through 138B-6. Due to a constitutional challenge to the provisions of Session Laws 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., the recodification was stayed and never went into effect. Session Laws 2017-6, s. 2, repealed Part I of 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., among which were the recodifying provisions in ss. 1 and 2.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2006-201, s. 25, made this Chapter effective October 1, 2006, and applicable to covered persons and legislative employees, to gifts received, to acts and conflicts of interest that arise, and to offenses committed, on or after January 1, 2007. Prosecutions for offenses or ethics violations committed before January 1, 2007, are not abated or affected by this act, and the statutes that would be applicable but for this act remain applicable to those prosecutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The preamble to Session Laws 2006-201 reads as follows: “Whereas, the people of North Carolina entrust public power to elected and appointed officials for the purpose of furthering the public, not private or personal, interest; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, to maintain the public trust, it is essential that government function honestly and fairly, free from all forms of impropriety, threats, favoritism, and undue influence; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, elected and appointed officials must maintain and exercise the highest standards of duty to the public in carrying out the responsibilities and functions of their positions; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, acceptance of authority granted by the people to elected and appointed officials imposes a commitment of fidelity to the public interest, and the power so entrusted should not be used to advance narrow interests for oneself or others; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, self-interest, partiality, and prejudice have no place in decisionmaking for the public good; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, public officials must exercise their duties responsibly with skillful judgment and energetic dedication; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, public officials must exercise discretion with sensitive information pertaining to public and private persons and activities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, to maintain the integrity of North Carolina’s State government, those citizens entrusted with authority must exercise it for the good of the public and treat every citizen with courtesy, attentiveness, and respect; and
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, because many public officials serve on a part-time basis, it is inevitable that conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts will occur. Often these conflicts are unintentional and slight, but at every turn those public officials who represent the people of this State must ensure that it is the interests of the people, and not their own, that are being served. Officials should be prepared to remove themselves immediately from decisions, votes, or processes where a conflict of interest exists;
     </p>
     <p>
      “Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2006-201, s. 22, provides: “The authority, powers, duties and functions, records, personnel, property, unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds, including the functions of budgeting and purchasing, of the North Carolina Board of Ethics of the Office of the Governor are transferred to the State Ethics Commission created in Section 1 of this act. The Director of the Budget shall resolve any disputes arising out of this transfer.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2006-201, s. 23(a), provides: “(a) Persons holding covered positions on January 1, 2007, shall file statements of economic interest under Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138A</a></cite> of the General Statutes by March 15, 2007.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2006-201, s. 23(b), as amended by Session Laws 2007-347, s. 16, provides: “Public servants holding positions on January 1, 2007, shall participate in ethics education presentations under G.S. 138A-14 and lobbying education programs under G.S. 120C-103 on or before January 1, 2008.”

      The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure that elected and appointed State agency officials exercise their authority honestly and fairly, free from impropriety, threats, favoritism, and undue influence.

The Revisor shall also incorporate into the re-recodified chapters all amendments to Chapters 163, 163A, 138A, and 120C that became effective on or after April 25, 2017, other than those made by S.L. 2017-6 or by Part VIII of S.L. 2018-2.”

The Revisor may modify statutory citations through- out the General Statutes, as appropriate, and may modify any references to statutory divisions, such as “Chapter,” “Subchapter,” “Article,” “Part,” “section,” and “subsection”; adjust the order of lists of multiple statutes to maintain statutory order; correct terms and conform names and titles changed by this act; eliminate duplicative references to the State Boards that result from the changes authorized by this section; and make conforming changes to catch lines and references to catch lines.

      Session Laws 2018-2, s. 8(a), provides: “The General Assembly finds that the legislative intent in the enactment of S.L. 2017-6 and establishment of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement was to continue the practice of having an independent, quasi-judicial body for elections and ethics enforcement for the State and consolidate those bodies under a single entity. The General Assembly finds that the entity enforcing these laws must have sufficient distance from political interference due to the potential for abuse of oversight of elections and ethics investigations for partisan purposes. The General Assembly further finds that appointment of a State Board member who is not affiliated with the two largest political parties will foster nonpartisan decision-making by the State Board. As such, by amending the section of the General Statutes establishing the membership of the State Board enacted in S.L. 2017-6, the purpose of this legislation is to implement the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court on January 26, 2018, in
      <i>
       Cooper v. Berger

      This section was recodified as now former G.S. 163A-157 by Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3. Former G.S. 163A-157 was then re-recodified as this section by Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(a), effective January 31, 2019. The historical citation from the former section has been added to this section as re-recodified.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section was amended by Session Laws 2008-213, s. 2(b), in the coded bill drafting format provided by G.S. 120-20.1.
   The act rewrote subsection (e), but the words “for” and “and advisory opinions issued under” were not set out as struck through in the act.
   Subsection (e) has been set out in the form above at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes. Session Laws 2009-570, s. 17, corrected the oversight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2008-215, s. 9, provides: “This act is effective when it becomes law [August 15, 2008] and applies to all information received or collected by the State Auditor concerning alleged violations of Chapters 138A or 120C of the General Statutes or Article 14 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120</a></cite> of the General Statutes on or after January 1, 2007.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2008-213, s. 91.5, was contingent on Section 6 of Senate Bill 1875, 2007 Regular Session (Session Laws 2008-215, s. 6) becoming law, which it did.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-156, s. 3, provides: “The State Ethics Commission may not require any individual serving on a metropolitan planning organization or rural transportation planning organization, who are not also members of the Board of Transportation, who has not yet complied with G.S. 138A-13 to complete ethics education as required by that statute, and may not apply Article 5 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138A</a></cite> of the General Statutes to any of those individuals. The State Ethics Commission is authorized to destroy the statement of economic interest forms that were filed by individuals pursuant to G.S. 136-202(e) and G.S. 136-211(e) and any associated written evaluation of those forms if the filer does not have authority to give final approval for actions of the metropolitan planning organization or rural transportation planning organization on which the filer serves and is not otherwise a covered person required to file a statement of economic interest.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2016-125, ss. 1 and 2, 4th Ex Sess., similarly recodified Chapters 120C, 138A, and 163 in a new Chapter. That new Chapter was designated as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>, and headings for new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>, Subchapter I, and Article 1 were enacted, along with new sections designated as G.S. 138B-1 through 138B-6. Due to a constitutional challenge to the provisions of Session Laws 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., the recodification was stayed and never went into effect. Session Laws 2017-6, s. 2, repealed Part I of 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., among which were the recodifying provisions in ss. 1 and 2.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(b), effective January 31, 2019, repealed Session Laws 2017-6, ss. 3 and 5(f), which had amended this section.
   Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3, had recodified this section. Session Laws 2017-6, s. 5(f), had, in subsection (a2) (now subsection (c)), substituted “State Board” for “Commission” in the introductory paragraph and in subdivision (a2)(1) (now subdivision (c)(1)), and deleted former subdivision (a2)(3) (now subdivision (c)(3)), and, in subsection (b1) (now subsection (e)), substituted “State Board” for “Commission” in the introductory paragraph and in subdivision (b1)(1) [now subdivision (e)(1)], and deleted subdivision (b1)(3) (now subdivision (e)(3)).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of disclosure of the financial and personal interests by covered persons is to assist covered persons and those who appoint, elect, hire, supervise, or advise them identify and avoid conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest between the covered person’s private interests and the covered person’s public duties. It is critical to this process that current and prospective covered persons examine, evaluate, and disclose those personal and financial interests that could be or cause a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest between the covered person’s private interests and the covered person’s public duties. Covered persons must take an active, thorough, and conscientious role in the disclosure and review process, including having a complete knowledge of how the covered person’s public position or duties might impact the covered person’s private interests. Covered persons have an affirmative duty to provide any and all information that a reasonable person would conclude is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Chapter and to fully disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest between the covered person’s public and private interests, but the disclosure, review, and evaluation process is not intended to result in the disclosure of unnecessary or irrelevant personal information.
