       Subdivision (16) of this section merely says that the owner is “engaged in the operation of aircraft.” It does not make it unlawful to operate an aircraft so as to cause harm nor does it deem a pilot to automatically be an agent of the owner.

      </p>
      <p>
       The law in North Carolina concerning the liability of an owner-lessor of an aircraft is governed by the common law of bailments. There is no strict or vicarious liability imposed upon the owner-lessor by the enactment of subdivision (16) of this section. Broadway v. Webb, 462 F. Supp. 429, 1977 U.S. Dist.

        City or County May Appropriate and Expend Public Funds for Acquisition or Construction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The acquisition of land for, and the construction and operation of, an airport for use by the public is a purpose for which a city or a county or both may appropriate and expend public funds and for which it or they may acquire land by the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1157 (1967).

       <b>
        Materiality of Amount of Use in Immediate Future. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a taking of land for the construction of an airport, as in the case of a taking for the construction of a road, if the taking is, in reality, for the purpose of making the property available for use by the public, it is immaterial that, in the immediate future, only a small segment of the public will be likely to make actual use of it. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1157 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that at the time of the taking of land by eminent domain for the purpose of building an airport there are no commitments from commercial air lines and the immediate prospect is for use only by a small number of private planes, is irrelevant where there is no suggestion that the airport would not be available and eventually used as a public facility. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1157 (1967).

        Flights over Private Land as Taking. —

       Flights over private land are not a taking, unless they are so low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land. Cochran v.

      </p>
      <p>
       A compensable taking of a flight or aviation easement does not occur until overflights constitute a material interference with the use and enjoyment of property, such that there is substantial diminution in fair market value. Cochran v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 281 S.E.2d 179, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2622 (1981).

      <p>
       Failure to condemn directly under this section for damage to property caused by frequent overflights allows plaintiffs, if they wish compensation for the diminution in value of their properties, the sole alternative of an action for inverse condemnation. Cochran v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 281 S.E.2d 179, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2622 (1981).

       Flying a plane over the land or pond of another does not constitute a trespass

        Proof of Adverse Use. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A use, to be adverse, must be over property as to which another possesses the right of lawful control. This section restricts the right of an owner to control the airspace over his property. Plaintiff, to establish adverse use, thus has the burden of proving that planes overflew defendant’s property at such heights as to interfere with the then existing use of the land or airspace, or as to be injurious to the health and happiness, or imminently dangerous to persons or property lawfully on the land.

      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is upon the party asserting a violation of this section,
   
   and evidence merely that the plane engaged in crop spraying operations was seen flying over the land of plaintiff at an altitude of 100 feet or more, without evidence that such flight disturbed any person on the ground or was imminently dangerous to persons or property, is insufficient to make out a cause of action for trespass.

In adopting or revising any such zoning regulations, the political subdivision shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain, the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport, the possibility of lowering or removing existing obstructions, and the views of the agency of the federal government charged with the fostering of civil aeronautics, as to the aerial approaches necessary to safe flying operations at the airport.

       Permits. —  Where advisable to facilitate the enforcement of zoning regulations adopted pursuant to this Article, a system may be established by any political subdivision for the granting of permits to establish or construct new structures and other uses and to replace existing structures and other uses or make substantial changes therein or substantial repairs thereof. In any event, before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement, change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree in question to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted; and whenever the administrative agency determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed: (i) no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations; and (ii) whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the said agency may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip such object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations or, if the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for 10 days after notice thereof, the said agency may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped. Except as indicated, all applications for permits for replacement, change or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted.

       Variances. —  Any person desiring to erect any structures, or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his property, in violation of airport zoning regulations adopted under this Article, may apply to the board of appeals, as provided in G.S. 63-33, subsection (c), for a variance from the zoning regulations in question.

It may not, however, acquire or take over any airport or other air navigation facility owned or controlled by any other municipality of the State without the consent of such municipality.

If but one municipality is involved and the charter of such municipality prescribes a method of acquiring property by condemnation, proceedings shall be had pursuant to the provisions of such charter and may be followed as to property within or without its territorial limits. The fact that the property needed has been acquired by any agency or corporation authorized to institute condemnation proceedings under power of eminent domain shall not prevent its acquisition by the municipality by the exercise of the right of eminent domain herein conferred when such right is exercised on the approach zone or on the airport site. For the purpose of making surveys and examinations relative to any condemnation proceedings, it shall be lawful to enter upon any land, doing no unnecessary damage.

It is also hereby authorized to acquire, in the same manner, land for the removal of airport hazards and the right of easement for a term of years or perpetually, to place or maintain suitable marks for the daytime marking and suitable lights for the nighttime marking of airport hazards, including the right of ingress or egress to or from such airport hazards for the purpose of maintaining and repairing such lights and marks.

It may also adopt ordinances designed to safeguard the public upon or beyond the limits of private airports or landing strips within such municipality or its police jurisdiction against the perils and hazards of instrumentalities used in aerial navigation. Such ordinances shall be published as provided by general law or the charter of the municipality for the publication of similar ordinances. They must conform to and be consistent with the laws of this State and shall be kept in conformity, as nearly as may be, with the then current federal legislation governing aeronautics and the regulations duly promulgated thereunder and rules and standards issued from time to time pursuant thereto.
