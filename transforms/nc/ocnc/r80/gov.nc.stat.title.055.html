     North Carolina Commentary
    </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This revision of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is based upon the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (1984) (hereinafter “the Model Act”). To maintain uniformity, the numbering of the sections corresponds to that of the Model Act, except
            that the General Statutes <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> number has been added to each section and the Model Act chapters have been changed to articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two types of comments appear. Under the designation “Official Comment” is the Official Comment of the Section of Corporation, Banking and Business Law of the American Bar Association for that section. Under the designation “North Carolina Comment” are
            the comments of the drafters who adapted the Model Act for enactment in North Carolina. The North Carolina comments are designed to note (1) deviations from the Model Act and (2) some significant changes from the former law. Some sections
            therefore do not have a North Carolina Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Editor’s Note.
    </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 1989, ch. 265, s. 1, effective July 1, 1990, rewrote <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> and entitled it the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, to replace former
            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, entitled the Business Corporation Act, which had been adopted by Session Laws 1955, c. 1371, s. 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 2 of Session Laws 1989, c. 265 provided: “The Revisor of Statutes shall cause to be printed along with this act all relevant portions of the Official Comments to the 1984 Revised Model Business Corporation Act and all explanatory comments of the
            drafters of this act as the Revisor may deem appropriate.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Official Comments appearing under individual sections in this Chapter have been printed by the publisher as received, without editorial change, and relate to the Chapter as originally enacted. However, not all sections in this Chapter may carry Official
            Comments. Furthermore, Official Comments may or may not have been received or updated in conjunction with subsequent amendments to this Chapter and, therefore, may not reflect all changes to the sections under which they appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where they appear in this Chapter, “Amended Comment” usually means that an error in the original comment has been corrected by a subsequent amendment, and “Supplemental Comment” pertains to a later development, such as an amendment to the statute text.
            North Carolina Comments explain where the General Assembly has enacted variations to the text of the Uniform Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where appropriate, the historical citations to sections of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> have been added to corresponding sections in current <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the case notes appearing under the sections of this Chapter were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> or under prior law.
        </p>
        <p>
            For tables of corresponding sections of former and current <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, see the tables at the end of this Chapter.

                <p>
                    Provisions similar to section 1.02 have their genesis in
                    <i>
       Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,
      </i> 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 518 (1819), which held that the United States Constitution prohibited the application of newly enacted statutes to existing corporations while suggesting the efficacy of a reservation of power similar to
                    section 1.02. The purpose of section 1.02 is to avoid any possible argument that a corporation has contractual or vested rights in any specific statutory provision and to ensure that the state may in the future modify its corporation
                    statutes as it deems appropriate and require existing corporations to comply with the statutes as modified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All articles of incorporation or certificates of authority granted under the Model Act are subject to the reservation of power set forth in section 1.02. Further, corporations “governed” by this Act—which includes all corporations formed or qualified
                    under earlier, general incorporation statutes that contain a reservation of power—are also subject to the reservation of power of section 1.02 and bound by subsequent amendments to the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many states have constitutional provisions mandating the reservation of power to amend or modify corporate statutes and charters. In these states section 1.02 is also supported by specific constitutional authorization.

                    As described in the Official Comment to section 1.20, documents are entitled to filing under the Model Act if they meet the substantive and formal requirements of the Act; they may also contain additional information if the person submitting the document
                    so elects. See the Official Comments to sections 1.20 and 1.25. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to vest the secretary of state with general authority to establish mandatory forms for use under the Model Act. Certain types
                    of reports and requests for documents may be processed efficiently only if uniform forms are prescribed by the secretary of state. Certificates of existence, for example, should require specific information located at specific places
                    on the form; similarly, processing of large-volume, largely routine filings is expedited if standardized forms are required. Also, the disclosure requirements of the annual report may be administered on a systematic basis if a standardized
                    form is mandated. Section 1.21(a) recognizes that these considerations may exist in limited cases, and expressly enumerates those forms for which the secretary of state is authorized to establish mandatory forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.21(b) authorizes (but does not require) the secretary of state to prepare forms suitable for use for other documents required or permitted to be filed under the Act. However, the use of these forms is permissive and cannot be required by the
                    secretary of state.

                    The Model Act was modified by changing “prescribe” to “promulgate,” because “prescribe” is inconsistent with the idea of optional forms.

                    Section 1.22 establishes in a single section the filing fees for all documents that may be filed under the Model Act. The dollar amounts for each document should be inserted by each state as it adopts the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of documents in section 1.22 includes all documents that are authorized to be filed with the secretary of state under the Model Act. The catch-all in subdivision (26) will apply to any document for which a state does not establish a specific
                    filing fee plus any document that later amendments to the statute may authorize or direct be filed with the secretary of state without establishing a specific filing fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision (9) states that no fee is applicable to filing the resignation of a registered agent. This provision permits a person who is named as a registered agent without his consent, or who agrees to serve as registered agent for a fee and the fee
                    is not paid, to eliminate any reference to himself in the records of the secretary of state without expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision (8) contains a maximum fee for filing a change of address of a registered agent. Since corporation service companies serve as registered agents for thousands of corporations in many jurisdictions, their change of address may require a very
                    large number of filings. Hence, the fee is broadly based on the number of corporations affected but a maximum fee is specified to reflect that as the number of changes increases the cost per change should decrease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 11.07, 15.20, and 15.31 require the secretary of state to serve process on foreign corporations under the circumstances there specified. The fee for this service is set forth in section 1.22(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.22(c) establishes standard fees for coping filed documents and certifying that copies are true copies under section 1.27.

                    This section contains a new fee schedule covering documents required or permitted to be filed under this Act, and the fees shown here combine the fees and taxes that were separately covered in former G.S. 55-155 and former G.S. 55-156. In some cases the
                    fees are higher than the fees and taxes under the prior law. The sliding scale that applied in some cases under the prior law is eliminated in favor of a flat fee in all cases. The format was adopted from the Model Act.

                    Section 1.28 establishes a procedure by which anyone may obtain a conclusive certificate from the secretary of state that a particular domestic or foreign corporation is in existence or is authorized to transact business in the state. The certificate
                    will probably be a standardized form. The secretary of state is to make the judgment whether or not the corporation is in existence or is authorized to transact business from public records only and is not expected to make a more extensive
                    investigation. In appropriate cases, the secretary of state may issue a certificate subject to specified qualifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.28(b)(5) refers only to taxes, fees, or penalties collected by the secretary of state or collected by other agencies and reported to the secretary of state. In some states the secretary of state may ascertain from other agencies that franchise
                    or other taxes have been paid and include this information in the certificate. In states where this procedure does not unduly delay the issuance of certificates, section 1.28 may be revised appropriately. Section 1.28(b)(5) relates
                    only to taxes, fees, or penalties to the extent their nonpayment affects the existence or authorization to transact business of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A certificate of existence or authorization that may be relied on as binding and conclusive is of material assistance to attorneys who may be required to give formal legal opinions in connection with corporate transactions.

                    Although it has no express counterpart in prior law, this section codifies the practice of the Secretary of State of issuing “certificates of good standing.” Although subdivision (b)(3) refers only to taxes, fees and penalties collected by the Secretary
                    of State, it is expected that the North Carolina Department of Revenue will continue the practice of giving letters confirming the payment of fees and taxes and penalties collectible by the Department.

                    Section 1.30 is intended to grant the secretary of state the authority necessary for his efficient performance of the filing and other duties imposed on him by the Act but is not intended to give him general authority to establish public policy. The most
                    important aspects of a modern corporation statute relate to the creation and maintenance of relationships among persons interested in or involved with a corporation; these relationships basically should be a matter of concern to the
                    parties involved and not subject to regulation or interpretation by the secretary of state. Further, even in situations where it is claimed that the corporation has been formed or is being operated for purposes that may violate the
                    public policies of the state, the secretary of state generally should not be the governmental official that determines the scope of public policy through administration of his filing responsibilities under the Act. Rather, the attorney
                    general may seek to enjoin the illegal conduct or to dissolve involuntarily the offending corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.30 is more narrowly drafted than earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states.

                    Section 1.40 collects in a single section definitions of terms used throughout the Model Act. Subchapters and sections of the Act in a few instances contain specialized definitions applicable only to those subchapters or sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the definitions of section 1.40 are drawn directly from earlier versions of the Model Act and are reasonably self-explanatory. A number of definitions, however, are new or deserve further explanation.

                    “Conspicuous” is defined in section 1.40(3) basically as defined in section 1-201(10) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. Even though the definition indicates some of the methods by which a provision may be made attention-calling, the test is whether attention
                    can reasonably be expected to be called to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Corporation,” “domestic corporation,” and “foreign corporation” are defined in sections 1.40(4) and (10). The word “corporation,” when used alone, refers only to domestic corporations. In a few instances, the phrase “domestic corporation” has been used
                    in order to contrast it with a foreign corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “distribution” defined in section 1.40(6) is a fundamental element of the financial provisions of the Model Act as amended in 1980. Section 6.40 sets forth a single, unitary test for the validity of any “distribution.” Section 1.40(6) in turn
                    defines “distribution” to include all transfers of money or other property made by a corporation to any shareholder in respect of the corporation’s shares, except mere changes in the unit of interest such as share dividends and share
                    splits. Thus, a “distribution” includes the declaration or payment of a dividend, a purchase by a corporation of its own shares, a distribution of evidences of indebtedness or promissory notes of the corporation, and a distribution
                    in voluntary or involuntary liquidation. If a corporation incurs indebtedness in connection with a distribution (as in the case of a distribution of a debt instrument or an installment purchase of shares), the creation, incurrence,
                    or distribution of the indebtedness is the event which constitutes the distribution rather than the subsequent payment of the debt by the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “indirect” in the definition of “distribution” is intended to include transactions like the repurchase of parent company shares by a subsidiary whose actions are controlled by the parent. It also is intended to include any other transaction in
                    which the substance is clearly the same as a typical dividend or share repurchase, no matter how structured or labeled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “entity,” defined in section 1.40(9), appears in the definition of “person” in section 1.40(16) and is included to cover all types of artificial persons. See also the definitions of “governmental subdivision,” in section 1.40(11), “state,” in
                    section 1.40(23), and “United States,” in section 1.40(25).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.40(17) defines the principal office of a corporation to be the office, within or without the state, where the principal executive office of the corporation is located. Many corporations maintain numerous offices, but there if usually one office,
                    sometimes colloquially referred to as the home office, headquarters, or executive suite, where the principal corporate officers are located. The corporation must designate its principal office address in the annual report required
                    by section 16.22. In case of doubt as to which corporate office is the principal office, the designation by the corporation in its annual report should be accepted as establishing the principal office of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of “shareholder” in section 1.40(22) includes a beneficial owner of shares named in a nominee certificate under section 7.23, but only to the extent of the rights granted the beneficial owner in the certificate — for example, the right
                    to receive notice of, and vote at, shareholders’ meeting. Various substantive sections of the Model Act also permit holders of voting trust certificates or beneficial owners of shares (not subject to a nominee certificate under section
                    7.23) to exercise some of the rights of a “shareholder.” See, for example, section 7.40 (derivative proceedings).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “secretary” is defined in section 1.40(20) since the Model Act does not require the corporation to maintain any specific or titled officers. See section 8.40. However, some corporate officer, however titled, must perform the functions described
                    in this definition, and that officer is referred to as the “secretary” in various sections of the Act that impose a duty on him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “person” is defined in section 1.40(16) to include an individual or an entity. In the case of an individual the Model Act assumes that the person is competent to act in the matter under general state law independent of the corporation statute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.40(26) defines “voting group” for purposes of the Act as a matter of convenient reference. A “voting group” consists of all shares of one or more classes or series that under the articles of incorporation or the revised Model Act are entitled
                    to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter. Shares entitled to vote “generally” on a matter under the articles of incorporation or this Act are for that purpose a single voting group. The word “generally” signifies all
                    shares entitled to vote on the matter by the articles of incorporation or this Act that do not expressly have the right to be counted or tabulated separately. “Voting groups” are thus the basic units of collective voting at a shareholders’
                    meeting, and voting by voting groups may provide essential protection to one or more classes or series of shares against actions that are detrimental to the rights or interests of that class or series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The determination of which shares form part of a single voting group must be made from the provisions of the articles of incorporation and of this Act. In a few instances under the Model Act, the board of directors may establish the right to vote by voting
                    groups. On most matters coming before shareholders’ meetings, only a single voting group, consisting of a class of voting or common shares, will be involved, and action on such a matter is effective when approved by that voting group
                    pursuant to section 7.25. See section 7.26(a). If a second class of shares is also entitled to vote on the matter, then a further determination must be made as to whether that class is to vote as a separate voting group or whether
                    it is to vote along with the other voting shares as part of a single voting group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Members of the board of directors are usually elected by the single voting group of shares entitled to vote generally; in some circumstances, however, some members of the board may be selected by one voting group and other members by one or more different
                    voting groups. See section 8.03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of a voting group permits the establishment by statute of quorum and voting requirements for a variety of matters considered at shareholders’ meetings in corporations with multiple classes of shares. See sections 7.25 and 7.26. Depending
                    on the circumstances, two classes or series of shares may vote together collectively on a matter as a single voting group, they may be entitled to vote on the matter separately as two voting groups, or one or both of them may not be
                    entitled to vote on the matter at all.

                    This section defines more terms than were defined in former G.S. 55-2 and in some cases the definitions are different. The following differences should be noted:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act in certain respects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (i) The phrase “unless otherwise specifically provided” was added to the introduction to allow for different definitions in Article 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (ii) Except for the final clause thereof, the definition of “corporation” was brought forward with minor modifications from prior law. The final clause, relating to the use of the term “corporation” in G.S. 55-9-01, was considered necessary because that
                    section, which was brought forward from prior law, uses the term “corporation” in certain cases to refer to any corporation, foreign or domestic. In the remainder of Article 9, the term “corporation” refers to domestic corporations
                    only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act uses the term “not-for-profit corporation” rather than the term “nonprofit corporation,” which is used in this Act. The terms “not-for-profit corporation” and “nonprofit corporation” are interchangeable in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>.
                    “Non-profit corporation” and “nonprofit association” were therefore used throughout this Act.

                                Subsection (b) specifically allows notice to be given by facsimile transmission. When the specified modes of communication of notice are impracticable as to one or more persons, subsection (b) is more limited than the Model Act in that it permits dispensing
                                with the specified mode only as to those persons with respect to whom it is impracticable.

                    Section 1.41(c) provides that notice by a corporation to its shareholders is effective when mailed if correctly addressed with sufficient postage. The correct address for this purpose is the address shown in the corporation’s records. The effect of this
                    section is to permit the corporation to compute the statutory time periods for notice of shareholders’ meetings and other actions from the date the notice is mailed without regard to where its shareholders are located or the time it
                    takes for the mail to reach them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Written notice to shareholders by persons other than the corporation is effective as provided in section 1.41(e). Notice by the corporation to its shareholders that is not addressed to the record address of the shareholder is effective when received under
                    section 1.41(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.41(d) provides that notice to a corporation may be addressed to the registered agent of the corporation at its registered office or to the corporation or its secretary at the principal office of the corporation as shown in its most recent public
                    filing. An officer, director, or shareholder of a corporation will normally give written notice to the corporation by delivering or mailing a copy of that notice to the corporation or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal
                    office. Such a notice is effective when it is received. Such notice may be given for a variety of purposes under this Act, e.g., giving notice of intent to dissent (section 13.21), notice of a demand to inspect books and records (section
                    16.02), and notices of resignation (sections 8.07 and 8.43). This method of giving notice to the corporation, however, is not exclusive, and an officer, director, or shareholder may give notice in other ways as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Persons who have no prior relationship with the corporation may give notice either to the registered agent of the corporation, or if they wish, to the corporation or its secretary at its principal office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.41 also contains a variety of general provisions dealing with notice. It recognizes, for example, that notice on some occasions may be given orally if that is reasonable under the circumstances. It also deals with situations where notice may
                    be sought to be given to persons for whom no current address is available, or where personal notice is impractical. Notice delivered to the person’s last known address is effective as described in section 1.41(e) even though never
                    actually received by the person. Section 1.41(b) also authorizes notice by publication in some circumstances, including radio, television, or other form of public wire or wireless communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.41(g) recognizes that other sections of the Act prescribe specific notice requirements for particular situations — e.g., service of process on a corporation’s registered agent under section 5.04 — and that these specific requirements, rather
                    than the general requirements of section 1.41, control. Finally, the second sentence of subsection 1.41(g) permits a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws to prescribe the corporation’s own notice requirements, if they
                    are not inconsistent with the general requirements of this section or specific requirements of other sections of the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules set forth in section 1.41 permit many other sections of the Model Act to be phrased simply in terms of giving or delivering notice without repeating details with respect to how notice should be given and when it is effective in various circumstances.

                <p>
                    Section 1.42 provides rules for determining the number of shareholders in a corporation. The Model Act generally avoids provisions that are based on the number of shareholders of a corporation, since these provisions may encourage individual shareholders
                    to divide or combine their holdings for private strategic advantage. But in two instances the number of shareholders is critical: to permit a corporation to dispense with a board of directors as its principal form of corporate governance
                    under section 8.01 and to elect close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement. The determination of the precise number of shareholders may also become important in other contexts in the future.

                    The section is different from the Model Act in that it counts all co-owners as a single shareholder, whereas the Model Act counts as a single shareholder only “three or fewer co-owners.”

                <p>
                    The definitions of “corporate action,” “defective corporate action” and “failure of authorization” are intentionally broad so as to permit ratification of any corporate action purportedly taken that would have been within the power granted to a corporation
                    under the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “defective corporate action” includes an “overissue” of shares and other defects in share issuances that could cause shares to be treated as void. For purposes of determining which shares are overissued, only those shares issued in excess of
                    the number of shares permitted to be issued under section 6.01 of the Act would be deemed overissued shares. If it cannot be determined from the records of the corporation which shares were issued before others, all shares included
                    in an issuance that is or results in an overissue would be overissued shares.

       Official Comment to the Model Business Corporation Act, 2016 Revision

                <p>
                    Subchapter E provides a statutory ratification procedure for corporate actions that may not have been properly authorized and shares that may have been improperly issued. The statutory ratification procedure is designed to supplement common law ratification.
                    Corporate actions ratified under this subchapter remain subject to equitable review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of defective corporate actions subject to ratification include the failure of the incorporator to validly appoint an initial board of directors, corporate action taken in the absence of board resolutions authorizing the action, the failure to
                    obtain the requisite shareholder approval of a corporate action, issuance of shares in the absence of evidence that consideration payable to the corporation for shares was received, the failure to comply with appraisal requirements
                    and the issuance of shares without complying with preemptive rights. The ratification procedure is intended to be available only where there is objective evidence that a corporate action was defectively implemented. For example, subchapter
                    E would permit ratification of shares previously issued but subsequently determined to have been issued improperly. It would not permit the corporation to issue shares retroactively as of an earlier date, however, where there is no
                    objective evidence that those shares had previously been issued. Objective evidence may include resolutions, issuance of share certificates, subscription or share purchase agreements, entries in a share ledger or other correspondence
                    indicating that shares were issued or intended to have been issued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.46(a) does not distinguish between void and voidable actions. Instead it provides that any defective corporate action that is ratified in accordance with section 1.47 or validated under section 1.52 shall not be void or voidable. Section 1.47
                    is not the exclusive means by which a defective corporate action may be ratified. Thus, the general common law doctrine of ratification, as applied to a board of directors’ adoption of actions taken by officers who may not have had
                    the actual authority to take such actions, continues to be an effective mode of ratification. Section 1.46(b) makes clear that the corporation’s ratification of a defective corporate action that is voidable but not void using common
                    law methods of ratification rather than under section 1.47 will not, standing alone, affect the validity of the action or create a presumption that the action is not valid. In addition, ratification under subchapter E is distinct from
                    correction of an already filed document under section 1.24.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.46(c) provides that an overissue can be remedied by the adoption of articles of amendment or other corporate action that has the effect of authorizing, designating or creating shares of a series or class, such that the putative shares that resulted
                    in the overissue are deemed to be validly issued from the date of original issuance. This provision enables a corporation to cure an overissue occurring when shares have been duly authorized but are issued before articles of amendment
                    are filed. It also permits a corporation to remedy an overissue even if it cannot specifically identify the putative shares.

                    Ratification is effective as of the validation effective time and is not dependent on the expiration of the 120-day time period in which an action challenging the ratification must be brought. The ratification of a defective corporate action has the additional
                    effect of ratifying corporate actions that are defective as a result of the original defective corporate action. For example, an overissue which results in subsequent director elections being invalid calls into question all actions
                    by the invalidly elected board members. The ratification of the overissue, however, would cure any such additional defects.

                    Section 1.52 confers plenary jurisdiction on a designated court to hear and determine claims regarding the validity of any corporate action or any shares, rights, options or warrants. The court’s jurisdiction is not limited to reviewing corporate actions
                    ratified or purportedly ratified under section 1.47, and includes the ability of a corporation or other permitted person to obtain a declaration regarding the validity of any corporate actions or shares that are potentially defective.
                    In determining the validity of a corporate action or reviewing a corporate action ratified under section 1.47, the court may consider any factors or considerations it deems proper under the circumstances. These might include whether
                    the person originally taking the defective corporate action believed that the action complied with corporate requirements, whether the corporation and board of directors has treated the defective corporate action as a valid action,
                    whether any person has acted in reliance on the public record that such defective corporate action was valid and whether any person will be or was harmed by the ratification of the defective corporate action or will be harmed by the
                    failure to ratify or validate the defective corporate action.

                    The only functions of incorporators under the Model Act are (1) to sign the articles of incorporation, (2) to deliver them for filing with the secretary of state, and (3) to complete the formation of the corporation to the extent set forth in section
                    2.05. One or more “persons” may serve as incorporator; “person” is defined in section 1.40 to include both individuals and entities; “entity” is also defined in that section to include corporations, unincorporated associations, partnerships,
                    trusts, estates, and governments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act also simplifies the formalities of execution and filing. The requirement in earlier versions of the Model Act and in many state statutes that articles be acknowledged or verified has been eliminated. Also, the requirement that “duplicate
                    originals” (each being executed as an original document) be submitted has been replaced with the requirement that a signed original and an “exact or conformed” copy be submitted. See the Official Comment to section 1.20.

                <p>
                    A corporation will have perpetual duration unless a special provision is included in its articles of incorporation providing for a shorter period. See section 3.02. Similarly, a corporation with articles of incorporation which do not contain a purpose
                    clause will have the purpose of engaging in any lawful business under section 3.01(a). The option of providing a narrower purpose clause is also preserved in sections 2.02(b)(2)(i) and 3.01, with the effect described in the Official
                    Comment to section 3.01.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a single class of shares is authorized, only the number of shares authorized need be stated; if more than one class of shares is authorized, however, both the number of authorized shares of each class and a description of the rights of each class must
                    be included. See the Official Comment to sections 6.01 and 6.02. It is unnecessary to specify par value, expected minimum capitalization, or contemplated issue price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The corporation’s initial registered office and agent must be included, and a mailing address alone, such as a post office box, is not sufficient since the registered office is the designated location for service of process. See chapter 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No reference need be made to a variety of other matters such as preemptive rights. See section 6.30 and its Official Comment. Generally, no substantive effect should be given tot he absence of a specific reference to such matters in section 2.02. They
                    are referred to in other sections of the Act that usually provide an “opt in” privilege. See particularly the list of optional provisions set forth in parts 4 and 5 of this Official Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.02(b) allows the articles of incorporation to contain optional provisions deemed sufficiently important to be of public record or subject to amendment only by the processes applicable to amendments of articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provisions relating to the business or affairs of the corporation that may be included in the articles may be subdivided into four general classes:
                </p>
                <p>
                    • provisions that under the Act may be elected only by specific inclusion in the articles of incorporation (a list of these provisions is set forth in part 4 of this Official Comment);
                </p>
                <p>
                    • provisions that under the Act may be elected by specific inclusion in either the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, as listed in part 5 of this Official Comment;
                </p>
                <p>
                    • other provisions not referred to in the Act, including any provision that the Act requires or permits to be set forth in the bylaws (see section 2.02(b)(b)(3)); and
                </p>
                <p>
                    • other provisions that are inconsistent with one or more provisions of the Act but are nonetheless permitted by section 7.32 for inclusion in a shareholders’ agreement, if the requirements of that section are met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.02(c) makes in unnecessary to set forth any corporate powers in the articles of incorporation in view of the broad grant of power in section 3.02. This grant of power, however, may be overbroad for particular corporations; if so, it may be qualified
                    or narrowed by appropriate provisions in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although par value is no longer a mandatory statutory concept under the Act, section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv) permits optional “par value” provisions with regard to shares. Other than being permitted by section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv), however, “par value” is not
                    mentioned in the Act. Special provisions may be included to give effect or meaning to “par value” essentially as a matter of contract between the parties. These provisions, whether appearing in the articles of incorporation or in other
                    documents, have only the effect any permissible contractual provision has in the absence of a prohibition by statute. Provision in the articles of incorporation establishing an optional par value may also be of use to corporations
                    which are to be qualified or registered in foreign jurisdictions that compute franchise or other taxes upon the basis of par value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For general discussion of capitalization, see the Official Comment to section 6.21.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic tenet of corporation law is that shareholders are not liable for the corporation’s liabilities by reason of their status as shareholders. Section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv) nevertheless permits a corporation to impose that liability under specified circumstances
                    if that is desirable. If no provision of this type is included, shareholders have no liability for corporate liabilities except to the extent they become liable by reason of their own conduct or acts. See section 6.22(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.02(b)(4) authorizes the inclusion of a provision in the articles of incorporation eliminating or limiting, with certain exceptions, the liability of the directors to the corporation or its shareholders for money damages. This section is optional
                    rather than self-executing and does not apply to equitable relief. Likewise, nothing in section 2.02(b)(4) in any way affects the right of the shareholders to remove directors, under section 8.08(a), with or without cause. The phrase
                    “as a director” emphasizes that section 2.02(b)(4) applies to a director’s actions or failures to take action in the director’s capacity as a director and not in any other capacity, such as officer, employee or controlling shareholder.
                    However, it is not intended to exclude coverage of conduct by individuals, even though they are also officers, employees or controlling shareholders, to the extent they are acting in their capacity as directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shareholders are given considerable latitude in limiting directors’ liability for money damages. The statutory exceptions to permitted limitations of director liability are few and narrow and are discussed below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       Financial Benefit
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corporate law subjects transactions from which a director could benefit personally to special scrutiny. The financial benefits exception is limited to the amount of the benefit actually received. Thus, liability for punitive damages could be eliminated,
                    except in cases of intentional infliction of harm or for violation of criminal law (as described below) where, in a particular case (for example, theft), punitive damages may be available. The benefit must be financial rather than
                    in less easily measured and more conjectural forms, such as business goodwill, personal reputation, or social ingratiation. The phrase “received by a director” is not intended to be a “bright line.” As a director’s conduct moves toward
                    the edge of what may be exculpated, the director should bear the risk of miscalculation. Depending upon the circumstances, a director may be deemed to have received a benefit that the director caused to be directed to another person,
                    for example, a relative, friend, or affiliate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What constitutes a financial benefit “to which the director is not entitled” is left to judicial development. For example, a director is entitled to reasonable compensation for the performance of services or to an increase in the value of stock or stock
                    options held by the director; on the other hand, a director is not entitled to a bribe, a kick-back, or the profits from a corporate opportunity improperly taken by the director. See section 8.70 as to procedures for disclaiming the
                    corporation’s interest in a business opportunity by action of qualified directors or shareholders. See section 2.02(b)(6) for optional provisions permitted in the articles of incorporation to limit or eliminate, in advance, any duty
                    of directors and others to bring business opportunities to the corporation. If the corporation declines the opportunity after it has been presented to the corporation by the director in accordance with the provisions of section 8.70(a)(1)(i)
                    or (ii), or if a provision under section 2.02(b)(6) limits or eliminates the duty to bring the particular opportunity to the corporation, the corporation will have no right to participate in any financial benefit arising from the opportunity

                <p>
                    There may be situations in which a director intentionally causes harm to the corporation even though the director does not receive any improper benefit. The use of the word “intentional,” rather than a less precise term such as “knowing,” is meant to
                    refer to the specific intent to perform, or fail to perform, the acts with actual knowledge that the director’s action, or failure to act, will cause harm, rather than a general intent to perform the acts which cause the harm.

                <p>
                    Section 8.32(a) indicates a strong policy in favor of liability for unlawful distributions approved by directors who have not complied with the standards of conduct of section 8.30. Accordingly, the exception in section 2.02(b)(4)(iii) prohibits the shareholders
                    from eliminating or limiting the liability of directors for a violation of section 8.32.

                <p>
                    Even though a director committing a crime may intend to benefit the corporation, the shareholders should not be permitted to exculpate the director for any harm caused by an intentional violation of criminal law, including, for example, fines and legal
                    expenses of the corporation in defending a criminal prosecution. The use of the word “intentional,” rather than a less precise term such as “knowing,” is meant to refer to the specific intent to perform, or fail to perform, the acts
                    with actual knowledge that the director’s action, or failure to act, constitutes a violation of criminal law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.02(b)(5) specifically prohibits provisions for indemnification of director liability arising out of improper financial benefit received by a director, an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders, an unlawful distribution
                    or an intentional violation of criminal law. These excepted liabilities parallel those a corporation is not permitted to limit or eliminate under section 2.02(b)(4). See “E. Limitations of Director Liability” above. Officers are not
                    included in the language of section 2.02(b)(5) because the expansion of indemnification for directors that section permits must be set forth in the articles of incorporation as required by section 8.51(a)(2); section 8.56 allows a
                    similar expansion of indemnification for officers to be set forth also in the bylaws, resolutions or contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.02(b)(6) authorizes the inclusion of a provision in the articles of incorporation to limit or eliminate, in advance, the duty of a director or other person to bring a business opportunity to the corporation. The limitation or elimination may
                    be blanket in nature and apply to any business opportunities, or it may extend only to one or more specified classes or categories of business opportunities. The adoption of such a provision constitutes a curtailment of the duty of
                    loyalty which includes the doctrine of corporate opportunity. If such a provision is included in the articles, taking advantage of a business opportunity covered by the provision of the articles without offering it to the corporation
                    will not expose the director or other person to whom it is made applicable either to monetary damages or to equitable or any other relief in favor of the corporation upon compliance with the requirements of section 2.02(b)(6).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This provision may be useful, for example, in the context of a private equity investor that wishes to have a nominee on the board but conditions its investment on an advance limitation or elimination of the corporate opportunity doctrine because of the
                    uncertainty over the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine inherent when investments are made in multiple enterprises in specific industries. Another example is a joint venture in corporate form where the participants in
                    the joint venture want to be sure that the corporate opportunity doctrine would not apply to their activities outside the joint venture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus of the advance limitation or elimination is on the duty of the director which extends indirectly to the investor through the application of the related party definition in section 8.60. This provision also permits extension of the limitation
                    or elimination of the duty to any other persons who might be deemed to have a duty to offer business opportunities to the corporation. For example, courts have held that the corporate opportunity doctrine extends to officers of the
                    corporation. Although officers may be included in a provision under this subsection, the limitation or elimination of corporate opportunity obligations of officers must be addressed by the board of directors in specific cases or by
                    the directors’ authorizing provisions in employment agreements or other contractual arrangements with such officers. Accordingly, section 2.02(b)(6) requires that the application of an advance limitation or elimination of the duty
                    to offer a business opportunity to the corporation to any person who is an officer of the corporation or a related person of an officer also requires action by the board of directors acting through qualified directors. This action
                    must be taken subsequent to the inclusion of the provision in the articles of incorporation and may limit the application. This means that if the advance limitation or elimination of the duty of an officer to offer business opportunities
                    to the corporation is included in the articles by an amendment recommended by the directors and approved by the shareholders, that recommendation of the directors does not serve as the required authorization by qualified directors;
                    rather, separate authorization by qualified directors after the amendment is included in the articles is necessary to apply the provision to a particular officer or any related person of that officer. See sections 1.43(a)(1) and 8.60
                    for the definition of “qualified directors” and “related persons,” respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether a provision for advance limitation or elimination of duty in the articles of incorporation should be a broad “blanket” provision or one more tailored to specific categories or classes of transactions deserves careful consideration given the particular
                    circumstances of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Limitation or elimination of the duty of a director or officer to present a business opportunity to the corporation does not limit or eliminate the director’s or officer’s duty not to make unauthorized use of corporate property or information or to compete
                    unfairly with the corporation.

                        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Receiver (FDIC-R) argued only that the evidence suggested that the Director Appellees took actions harmful to the bank, in part by making decisions without adequate information; this was insufficient. The exculpatory

                        that could have been better made did not rise to the level of bad faith in this context, especially in light of the fact that the bank received “CAMELS” scores of “2” from both of its regulators despite the Director Appellees’

                    Section 2.03(a) provides that the existence of a corporation begins when the articles of incorporation are filed, unless a delayed effective date is specified under section 1.23. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a></cite>                    contains detailed rules for the filing and effective dates of documents, all of which are applicable to articles of incorporation and other documents. These filing rules simplify the process of creating a corporation in several respects.

                <p>
                    Section 1.20 requires that only one executed original and an exact or conformed copy of the articles need be delivered to the secretary of state for filing. This delivery must be accompanied by the applicable filing fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.25 provides that the secretary of state files the articles by stamping them “filed” and recording the date and time of receipt; he then retains the signed original articles of incorporation for his records and returns the exact or conformed
                    copy to the incorporators along with a receipt for the fee. The return of this copy and the fee receipt establishes that the articles have been filed in the form of the copy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 1.25 provides that approval by the secretary of state is in the form of return of the copy of the articles with a fee receipt rather than a certificate of incorporation, as was the older practice still followed in many states. See the Official
                    Comment to section 1.25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.03(a) ties the precise time of incorporation to the date and time stamped on the articles. Section 1.23 provides in turn that this is the date and time the articles are received by the secretary of state; in other words, consistent with the
                    practice of many secretaries of state, processing time is ignored and the date and time of receipt of the articles are the date and time of incorporation. The creators of the corporation may, however, specify that the corporation’s
                    existence will begin on a later date than the date of filing, and at a precise time on such a date, to the extent permitted by section 1.23.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 2.03(b) the filing of the articles of incorporation as evidenced by return of the stamped copy of the articles with the fee receipt is conclusive proof that all conditions precedent to incorporation have been met, except in proceedings brought
                    by the state. Thus the filing of the articles of incorporation is conclusive as to the existence of limited liability for persons who enter into transactions on behalf of the corporation. If articles of incorporation have not been
                    filed, section 2.04 generally imposes personal liability on all persons who prematurely act as or on behalf of a “corporation” knowing that articles have not been filed. Section 2.04 may protect some of these persons to a limited extent,
                    however; see the Official Comment to that section.

                        The mere fact that one person owns all of the stock of a corporation does not make its acts the acts of the stockholder so as to impose liability therefor upon him. However, when the corporation is so operated that it is a mere instrumentality or alter

                </p>
                <p>
                    Following incorporation, the organization of new corporation must be completed so that it may engage in business. This usually requires adoption of bylaws, the appointment of officers and agents, the raising of equity capital by the issuance of shares
                    to the participants in the venture, and the election of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier versions of the Model Act required initial directors to be named in the articles and provided that they complete the organization of the corporation. Many states followed this pattern, but others provided that the incorporators organize the corporation
                    or meet to elect a board of directors to organize the corporation. The goal of all these provisions was usually to permit the completion of the organization of the corporation with minimum expense and formality, though in many cases
                    it was felt necessary for business decisions to be made at an early stage by the persons with responsibility for business operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience in states followed the Model Act pattern revealed that multiple organizational meetings were often necessary, particularly where for reasons of convenience or secrecy both the incorporators and initial directors were “dummies” without any financial
                    interest in the enterprise who were not expected to make any significant business decisions. In this situation, the initial directors formally organized the corporation, including issuing of at least some shares; immediately following
                    this organizational meeting, the new shareholders met to elect a permanent board of directors who were to manage the business. In many instances, the permanent board of directors also had to meet immediately after its selection by
                    the shareholders to consider business questions that must be resolved promptly, such as authorization of employment contracts or the valuation of property or services to be accepted as consideration for shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2.05 simplifies the formation process by allowing alternative methods of completing the formation of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, section 2.05(a)(1) contemplates that if the draftsman elects to set forth the names of the initial directors in the articles of incorporation, the persons so named will organize the corporation. It is expected that initial directors will be named
                    only if they will be the permanent board of directors and there is no objection to the disclosure of their identity in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, section 2.05(a)(2) provides alternative methods for completing the organization of the corporation if initial directors are not named in the articles of incorporation. The incorporators may themselves complete the organization, or they may simply
                    meet to elect a board of directors who are then to complete the organization. It is contemplated that in routine incorporations, the first alternative will be elected, while in more complex situations when prompt business decisions
                    must be made, the second alternative will be chosen and the completion of the organization will be turned over to the board of directors representing the investment interests in the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 2.05(b) and (c) are limited to meetings of incorporators since sections 8.21 and 8.22 permit the same actions by the board of directors. If a meeting of shareholders is necessary, sections 7.01 and 7.04 give them the same flexibility that is
                    given incorporators under sections 2.05(b) and (c).

                    The Model Act’s use of the word “shall” in subsection (a) requires that a corporation have bylaws, whereas, under prior law, the adoption of bylaws was at least theoretically optional. Use of the word “shall,” however, is not intended to imply that a
                    North Carolina corporation not adopting bylaws is not a valid corporation.

                    Section 2.07 is no longer an optional provision (as was the case with its predecessor in earlier versions of the Model Act) but is unqualifiedly recommended for adoption. The problem it addresses is potentially present in every state and in every corporation,
                    and the widespread acceptance of the earlier provision to date by a number of states argues that it be uniformly adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adoption of emergency bylaws in advance of an emergency not only clarifies lines of command and responsibility but also tends to ensure continuity of responsibility. The board of directors may be authorized by the emergency bylaws, for example, to
                    designate the officers or other persons, in order of seniority and subject to various conditions, who may be deemed to be directors during the emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of “emergency” adopted by subsection (d) is broader than a nuclear disaster or attack on the United States. It includes any catastrophic event, such as an airplane crash or fire, that makes it difficult or impossible for a quorum of the
                    corporation’s board of directors to be assembled. While there apparently has been no recent illustration of a public corporation facing such a catastrophic event, its possibility should not be ignored. In order to encourage corporations
                    to adopt emergency bylaws, section 2.07(c) broadly validates all corporate actions taken “in good faith” pursuant to them and immunizes all corporate directors, officers, employees, and agents from liability as a result of these actions.
                    The phrase “action taken in good faith in accordance with the emergency bylaws” has been substituted for “willful misconduct,” the language of the earlier Model Act provision. This change is designed to conform the standard for immunity
                    here and elsewhere in the Model Act and represents no substantive change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation that does not adopt emergency bylaws under this section may nevertheless exercise the powers described in section 3.03 in the event of an emergency as defined in section 2.07(d).

                    This section has no equivalent under prior law. The Model Act was rewritten in subsection (c) to clarify that the limitation on liability contained in that subsection is limited to liability arising by reason of action taken by special procedures under
                    emergency bylaws.

                    Section 3.01(a) provides that every corporation automatically has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business unless a narrower purpose is described in the articles of incorporation. The specification of an “any lawful business” clause has become so
                    nearly universal in states that permit the clause that no reason exists for treating it otherwise than as the norm for the “standard” corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The option of a narrower purpose clause is most likely to be elected only in situations where one or more participants in the corporation desire to limit or retain a check on the business operations of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may
                    limit lines of business in which the corporation may engage. It should be recognized, however, that the limited scope of the ultra vires concept in litigation between the corporation and outsiders means that a third person entering
                    into a transaction that violates the restrictions in the purpose clause may be able to enforce the transaction in accordance with its terms if he was unaware of the narrow purpose clause when he entered the transaction. See the Official
                    Comment to section 3.04.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many corporations may also find it desirable to supplement a general purpose clause with an additional statement of business purposes. This may be necessary for licensing or for qualification purposes in some states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 3.01(b) is designed to tie in the limitless lawful purpose corporation permitted by section 3.01(a) with the numerous state statutes that impose regulations or limitations on corporations formed to, or actually engaging in, certain lines of business.
                    These state statutes are of various types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these statutes, particularly those relating to banking and insurance, establish a separate incorporation process and incorporating agency. These special incorporating states may refer back to or incorporate by reference portions of the general
                    business corporation statute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other regulatory statutes may permit incorporation under the general business corporation act if the corporation imposes restrictions or limitations in its articles of incorporation; these restrictions may relate to the business in which the corporation
                    may engage, its manner of internal governance, or the persons who may or may not be shareholders and participate in the venture. The language of section 3.01(b) is designed to cover all these multiple variations and is a substitute
                    for the narrower language “except for the purpose of banking or insurance” that appeared in earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states.
                </p>

                    Traditionally, incorporation was not permitted at all for the purpose of practicing the learned professions—e.g., law, medicine, and dentistry—primarily because of the personal skills and confidential relationships between lawyer and client or physician
                    and patient. In the early 1960s, however, a significant movement toward incorporation of professionals surfaced as part of an effort by professionals to obtain employee federal tax benefits. Professionals hoped to form corporations
                    to conduct their practice as employees of the corporation rather than as independent entrepreneurs. Early efforts by professionals to form entities to conduct their practice (despite the lack of state statutory authority to incorporate)
                    met with opposition from the Internal Revenue Service. In 1960 the I.R.S. issued the “Kintner” regulations, which in effect provided that federal tax status would be determined on the basis of the organization’s characterization under
                    state law. TREAS. REGS. § 301.7701-2 (1960). In response, a number of states passed legislation specifically authorizing professionals to incorporate. Recognition of the corporate tax status of professional corporations was eventually
                    conceded. REV. RUL. 70-101, 1970-1 C.B. 278. All jurisdictions now have statutes providing for incorporation for the purpose of practicing a profession, and in 1977 a Professional Corporation Supplement to the Model Act was approved.
                    For further consideration of professional corporation acts, see the Annotations to the Model Professional Corporation Supplement.

                    Other types of corporations, such as nonprofit corporations, cooperatives, and unions, usually may not incorporate under the business corporation act. Many states have enacted special statutes for these classes entities: a Model Nonprofit Corporation
                    Act was approved in 1952 and has been periodically revised since then.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The law of corporations has always proceeded on the fundamental assumption that corporations are creations with limited power; such an assumption was articulated by the United States Supreme Court as early as 1804,
                    <i>
       Head &amp; Armory v. Providence Insurance Co.,
      </i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 127, 169 (1804), and appears never to have been seriously questioned as a judicial matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is clear that narrow and limited powers clauses are undesirable: they encourage litigation by bringing into question reasonable transactions that further the business and interests of the corporation and to the extent transactions are unauthorized,
                    may defeat valid and reasonable expectations. The history of the Model Act and of many state statutes in this area is largely one ensuring that corporate powers are broad enough to cover all reasonable business transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In developing section 3.02, serious consideration was given to whether there was a continued need for a long list of corporate powers or whether a general provision granting every corporation power to act to the same extent as an individual might be substituted.
                    Because of the long history of these powers, however, it was feared that no matter how broadly phrased a general provision might be, a court might conclude that some power might not exist because no specific reference to it was made
                    in the statute. It was also feared that cautious attorneys might begin to restore power clauses to articles of incorporation out of concern that a general clause of the type in question might not be interpreted literally. Hence, the
                    present language, which is similar to that included in the statutes of California and other states, was adopted. The general clause granting the corporation essentially the same powers as an individual is coupled with a nonexclusive
                    listing of powers, including the traditional power clauses that appear in many state statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general philosophy of section 3.02 is thus that corporations formed under the Model Act provisions should be automatically authorized to engage in all acts and have all powers that an individual may have. Because broad grants of power of this nature
                    may not be desired in some corporations, section 3.02 generally authorizes articles of incorporation to deny or limit specific powers to a specific corporation if that is felt desirable. This power to exclude specific powers does not
                    reflect a substantive change from earlier versions of the Model Act (which did not contain an express provision to this effect) but simply makes explicit what was always implicit. Illustrative of the powers that may be appropriate
                    for limitation in specific corporations are the powers (discussed below) to make political contributions to the extent permitted by law or to make expenditures to influence elections affecting the corporate business to the extent permitted
                    by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The powers listed in section 3.02 were broadened in several significant respects:

                    <li id="t55a03s55-3-02ol21">
                        All limitations on loans to directors have been eliminated. The wisdom and propriety of these loans should be evaluated on the basis of general fiduciary standards and the benefits to the corporation. See sections 8.30, 8.31, and 8.32. Section 3.02(11)
                        thus rejects the conceptual argument that because certain transactions are subject to abuse, all such transactions should be prohibited.
                    </li>

                        It is made clear in section 3.02(12) that former as well as present directors, officers, employees, and agents may participate in pension, option, and similar benefit plans.

                        permits contributions for purposes that may not be charitable, such as for political purposes or to influence elections. This power exists only to the extent consistent with law other than the Model Act. It is the purpose of this
                        section to authorize all corporate actions that are lawful or not against public policy.

                    (3) Section 3.02(15) permits payments or donations or other acts “that further the business and affairs of the corporation.” This clause, which is in addition to and independent of the power to make charitable and similar donations under section 3.02(13),
                    permits contributions for purposes that may not be charitable, such as for political purposes or to influence elections. This power exists only to the extent consistent with law other than the Model Act. It is the purpose of this section

                </p>
                <p>
                    The powers of a corporation under the Model Act exist independently of whether a corporation has a broad or narrow purpose clause. A corporation with a narrow purpose clause nevertheless has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary
                    or convenient to carry out its business. Many actions are therefore intra vires even though they do not directly affect the limited purpose for which the corporation is formed. For example, a corporation may generally make charitable
                    contributions without regard to the purpose for which the charity will use the funds or may invest money in shares of other corporations without regard to whether the corporate purpose of the other corporation is broader or narrower
                    than the limited purpose clause of the investing corporation. In some instances, however, a limited or narrow purpose clause may be considered to be a restriction on corporate powers as well as a restriction on purposes. Since the
                    same ultra vires rule is applicable to corporations that exceed their purposes or powers (see the Official Comment to section 3.04), it is not necessary to determine whether a narrow purpose clause also limits the powers of the corporation
                    but simply whether the purpose of the transaction in question is consistent with the purpose clause. Of course, these issues cannot arise in corporations with an “any lawful business” purpose clause.

                    This section contains essentially all of the powers enumerated in former G.S. 55-17, but it avoids the distinction that the prior law made between unconditional powers and those exercisable by a corporation “only in connection with the purposes stated
                    in its charter,” and lists all powers in a single sequence. The words “or this act” were added to the Model Act’s introductory language in subsection (a) to emphasize that there may be limiting provisions elsewhere in
                    <cite
                        class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>. Subdivision (a)(11) was modified to incorporate language from former G.S. 55-17(a)(4) that was believed to be less restrictive than the Model Act’s language,
                        and subdivision (12) was modified by changing the Model Act’s reference to “share” bonus and “share” option plans to the more commonly used terms, “stock” bonus and “stock” option plans. Subdivision (13) was modified to add donations
                        for religious and cultural purposes, which were permitted under former G.S. 55-17(a)(6). Subdivision (16) brings forward former G.S. 55-17(b) (4), and is more specific than the Model Act in authorizing insurance on the corporation’s
                        directors, officers, employees and security holders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, former G.S. 55-17(c) was added to this section as subsection (b) to avoid any negative inference by its omission. It does not appear in the Model Act.

                            Property of a corporation belongs to it, not to the stockholders. They only have an interest in such property through their relation to the company, and in this respect the State is like any other stockholder. Marshall v. Western N.C.R.R.,

                            Corporate directors are trustees of the corporation’s property, and usually a corporation may sell, transfer, and convey its corporate real estate only when authorized to do so by its board of directors. And statutory provisions may be supplemented by

                            In the absence of charter provisions or bylaws to the contrary, the president of a corporation is the general manager of its corporate affairs, and his contracts made in the name of the corporation in the general course of business and within the apparent

                    Section 3.03 should be read in conjunction with section 2.07, which authorizes a corporation to adopt emergency or standby bylaws. Section 3.03 grants every corporation limited powers to act in an emergency even though it has failed to enact emergency
                    bylaws under section 2.07.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An “emergency” for purposes of section 3.03 is defined in subsection (d) as any catastrophic event that makes it difficult or impossible to assemble a quorum of directors. In this situation, section 3.03(b) dispenses with or relaxes notice requirements
                    and permits corporate officers to serve as directors in order to achieve a quorum. The section also authorizes the board of directors, either before or during an emergency, to modify lines of succession and relocate the principal business
                    office of the corporation. These actions may be taken only by the board of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present after giving effect, if necessary, to section 3.03(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These minimal provisions, it is believed, should permit a corporation to continue to function in the face of an emergency even if no emergency bylaws have been adopted under section 2.07.

                <p>
                    The basic purpose of section 3.04 — as has been the purpose of all similar statutes during the 20th century — is to eliminate all vestiges of the doctrine of inherent incapacity of corporations. See Campbell, “The Model Business Corporation Act,” 11-4
                    BUS. LAW. 98, 102 (1956). Under this section it is unnecessary for persons dealing with a corporation to inquire into limitations on its purposes or powers that may appear in its articles of incorporation. A person who is unaware of
                    these limitations when dealing with the corporation is not bound by them. The phrase in section 3.04(a) that the “validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act” applies
                    equally to the use of the doctrine as a sword or as a shield: a third person may no more avoid an undesired contract with a corporation on the ground the corporation was without authority to make the contract than a corporation may
                    defend a suit on a contract on the ground that the contract is ultra vires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language of section 3.04 extends beyond contracts and conveyances of property; “corporate action” of any kind cannot be challenged on the ground of ultra vires. For this reason it makes no difference whether a limitation in articles of incorporation
                    is considered to be a limitation on a purpose or a limitation on a power; both are equally subject to section 3.04. Corporate action also includes inaction or refusal to act. The common law of ultra vires distinguished between executory
                    contracts, partially executed contracts, and fully executed ones; section 3.04 treats all corporate action the same — except to the extent described in section 3.04(b) — and the same rules apply to all contracts no matter at what stage
                    of performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 3.04, however, does not validate corporate conduct that is made illegal or unlawful by statute or common law decision. This conduct is subject to whatever sanction, criminal or civil, that is provided by the statute or decision. Whether or not
                    illegal corporate conduct is voidable or rescindable depends on the applicable statute or substantive law and is not affected by section 3.04.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 3.04 also does not address the validity of essentially intra vires conduct that is not approved by appropriate corporate action. It does not deal, for example, with the enforceability of an executory contract to sell substantially all the assets
                    of a corporation not in the ordinary course of business that was not approved by the shareholders as required by section 12.02. This type of transaction is not beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation; it simply has not been
                    approved by the corporate authorities as required by law. Similarly, section 3.04 does not deal with whether a corporation is bound by the action of a corporate agent if the action requires, but has not received, approval by the board
                    of directors. Whether or not the corporation is bound by this action depends on the law of agency, particularly the scope of apparent authority and whether the third person knew or should have known of the defect in the corporate approval
                    process. These actions may be ultra vires with respect to the agent’s authority but they are not ultra vires with respect to the corporation and are not controlled by section 3.04.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, corporate action is not ultra vires under section 3.04 merely because it constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty. For example, a misuse of corporate assets for personal purposes by an officer or director is a breach of fiduciary duty and may
                    be enjoined. Similarly, in some circumstances a lien on corporate assets and a contract entered into by the corporation may be cancelled or enjoined if they constitute breaches of fiduciary duty and the third person is charged with
                    knowledge that they were improper. These transactions, however, are not ultra vires with respect to the corporation, and cannot be attacked under section 3.04. They may be enjoined because of breach of the fiduciary duty, not because
                    the transaction exceeds the powers or purposes of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 3.04(b), like the prior Model Act provisions, permits challenges to the corporation’s lack of power in three limited classes of cases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t55a03s55-3-04ol21">
                        In suits by the attorney general under section 14.30. This provision does not answer the question whether or not a corporation may be dissolved or enjoined by the attorney general for committing an ultra vires act; it simply preserves the power of the
                        state to assert that certain corporate action was ultra vires.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t55a03s55-3-04ol22">
                        In a suit by the corporation, either directly or through a legal representative, against incumbent or former officers or directors for authorizing or causing the corporation to engage in an ultra vires act. Again, this section does not address whether
                        or not there is liability for causing the corporation to enter into an ultra vires act; it simply preserves the power of the corporation to assert that certain corporate action was ultra vires.
                    </li>

                        In a suit by a shareholder against the corporation to enjoin an ultra vires act. This suit, however, is subject to the requirements of section 3.04(c). Under this subsection an ultra vires act may be enjoyed only if all “affected parties” are parties
                        to the suit. The requirement that the action be “equitable” generally means that only third persons dealing with a corporation while specifically aware that the corporation’s action was ultra vires will be enjoined. The general
                        phrase “if equitable” was retained because of the possibility that other circumstances may exist in which it may be equitable to refuse to enforce an ultra vires contract. Further, if enforcement of the contract is enjoined, either
                        the third person or the corporation may in the discretion of the court be awarded damages from the other for loss (excluding anticipated profits).

                    (2) In a suit by the corporation, either directly or through a legal representative, against incumbent or former officers or directors for authorizing or causing the corporation to engage in an ultra vires act. Again, this section does not address whether
                    or not there is liability for causing the corporation to enter into an ultra vires act; it simply preserves the power of the corporation to assert that certain corporate action was ultra vires.

                    (3) In a suit by a shareholder against the corporation to enjoin an ultra vires act. This suit, however, is subject to the requirements of section 3.04(c). Under this subsection an ultra vires act may be enjoyed only if all “affected parties” are parties
                    to the suit. The requirement that the action be “equitable” generally means that only third persons dealing with a corporation while specifically aware that the corporation’s action was ultra vires will be enjoined. The general phrase
                    “if equitable” was retained because of the possibility that other circumstances may exist in which it may be equitable to refuse to enforce an ultra vires contract. Further, if enforcement of the contract is enjoined, either the third

                <p>
                    Section 3.04(c) thus authorizes a court to enjoin or set aside an ultra vires act or grant other relief that may be necessary to protect the interests of all affected persons, including the interests of third persons who deal with the corporation.

                        Doctrine of ultra vires has been very much modified, and many contracts made in the course of business, especially when executed and benefits are received or liabilities are incurred, will be upheld and enforced which were once declared absolutely void.

                        Corporation could not rely on its violation of former G.S. 55-13 to justify its failure to receive notice of suit. Consequently, it did not give notice of suit to its insurer at the time it was reasonably expected to receive actual notice thereof, thus
                        failing to notify insurer as soon as practicable. South Carolina Ins. Co. v. Hallmark Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 364 S.E.2d 678, <cite class="nc_code">19<cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite></cite>

                    Section 6.01 adopts a new terminology from that traditionally used in corporation statutes to describe classes of shares that may be created, but makes only limited substantive changes from earlier versions of the Model Act. Traditional corporation statutes
                    work from a perceived inheritance of concepts of “common shares” and “preferred shares” that at one time may have had considerable meaning but that today often do not involve significant distinctions. It is possible under modern corporation
                    statutes to create classes of “common” shares that have important preferential rights and classes of “preferred” shares that are subordinate in all important economic aspects or that are indistinguishable from common shares in either
                    voting rights or entitlement to participate in the assets of the corporation upon dissolution. The revised Model Act breaks away from the inherited concepts of “common” and “preferred” shares and develops more general language to reflect
                    the actual flexibility in the creation of classes of shares that exists in modern corporate practice. The words “common shares” or “preferred shares” are no longer used in the revised Model Act, though the words appear in a few instances
                    in examples appearing in the Official Comment.

                    Section 6.01(a) requires that the articles of incorporation prescribe the classes of shares and the number of shares of each class that the corporation is authorized to issue. If the articles authorize the issue of only one class of shares, no designation
                    or description of the shares is required, it being understood that these shares have both the power to vote and the power to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution. See section 6.01(b). Shares with both of these
                    characteristics are usually referred to as “common shares” or “common stock,” but no specific designation is required by the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If more than one class of shares is authorized, the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of each class of shares must be described in the articles of incorporation before any shares of that class are issued, or the board of directors may be given
                    authority to establish them under section 6.02. These descriptions constitute the “contract” of the holders of those classes of shares with respect to their interest in the corporation and must be set forth in sufficient detail reasonably
                    to define their interest. The designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares with one or more special or preferential rights which may be authorized are further described in section 6.01(c).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If more than one class is authorized (or if only one class is originally authorized but at some future time one or more other classes of shares are added by amendment), the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of each class or classes of shares,
                    including the class or classes that possess the fundamental characteristics of voting and residual equity financial interests, must be described before shares of those classes are issued. If both fundamental characteristics are placed
                    exclusively in a single class of shares, that class may be described simply as “common shares” or by statements such as the “shares have general distribution and voting rights,” the “shares have all the rights of common shares,” or
                    the “shares have all rights not granted to the class A shares.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the articles of incorporation create classes of shares that divide these fundamental rights among two or more classes of shares, it is necessary that the rights be clearly allocated among the classes. Specificity is required only to the extent necessary
                    to differentiate the relative rights of the respective classes. For example, where one class has a liquidation preference over another, it is necessary to specify only the preferential liquidation right of that class; in the absence
                    of a contrary provision in the articles, the remaining class would be entitled to receive the net assets remaining after the liquidation preference has been satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than one class of shares may be designated as “common shares;” however, each must have a “distinguishing designation” under section 6.01(a), e.g., “nonvoting common shares” or “class A common shares,” and the rights of the classes must be described.
                    For example, if a corporation authorizes two classes of shares with equal rights to share in all distributions and with identical voting rights except that one class is entitled exclusively to elect one director and the second class
                    is entitled exclusively to elect a second director, the two classes may be designated, e.g., as “Class A common” and “Class B common,” and described, e.g., as “a class of common shares with the right to elect one director.” What is
                    required is language that makes the location of these rights clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than describing the terms of each class of shares in the articles of incorporation, the corporation may delegate to the board of directors under section 6.02 the power to establish the terms of a class of shares (or of a series within a class of
                    shares (if no shares of that class (or series) have previously been issued. Those terms, however, must be set forth in an amendment to the articles of incorporation before the shares are issued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(b) requires that every corporation authorize one or more classes of shares that have the two fundamental characteristics of having unlimited voting rights and the right to receive the net assets of the corporation upon its dissolution. These
                    two fundamental characteristics need not be placed in a single class of shares but may be divided as desired. It is nevertheless essential that the corporation always have authorized shares with these two characteristics, and section
                    6.03 requires that shares having in the aggregate these characteristics always be outstanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(b) ensures that there is always in existence one or more classes of shareholders who share in the ultimate residual interest in the corporation and who are entitled to elect a board of directors and make other fundamental decisions with respect
                    to the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(c) lists the principal features that are customarily incorporated into classes of shares. Section 6.01(d) makes clear that this listing is not exhaustive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(c) authorizes creation of classes of shares with limited or residual rights without significant limitation. In earlier versions of the Model Act and in the statutes of many states, certain types of rights or privileges are not permitted.
                    Many such statutes, for example, prohibit the creation of a class of voting shares without preferential financial rights that is callable at the discretion of the corporation (“callable common shares”). Another common prohibition is
                    against shares that have the power to be converted at the option of the shareholder into other classes of shares that have preferential financial rights, or into debt securities of the corporation (“upstream” conversion privileges).
                    For the reasons set forth below, these restrictions are not preserved in the revised Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any class of shares may be granted multiple or fractional votes per share without limitation. See section 7.21. Shares of any class may also be made nonvoting “except to the extent prohibited by this Act.” This “except” clause refers to the provisions
                    in the Model Act that permit shares that are designated to be nonvoting to vote as separate voting groups on amendments to articles of incorporation and other organic changes in the corporation that directly affect that class (sections
                    7.26 and 10.04). In addition, shares may be given voting rights that are limited or conditional (e.g., on the passing of a specified number of dividends). Section 6.01(b), however, requires that there always be one or more classes
                    of shares that together have unlimited voting rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(c)(2) permits classes of shares to be made redeemable on the terms set forth in the articles of incorporation. Under this section, shares may be made “redeemable” at the option of the holder, the corporation, or another person; shares redeemable
                    at the option of the corporation are sometimes called “callable shares,” while shares redeemable at the option of the shareholder are sometimes described as involving a “put.” The Model Act permits either type of redemption for any
                    class of shares and thereby permits the creation of redeemable or callable shares without limitation (subject only to the provisos that the class or classes of shares described in section 6.01(b) must always exist and that at least
                    one share of each class with those rights or powers must be outstanding under section 6.03).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states contain a direct or indirect prohibition against callable voting shares or callable common shares. Even where such a prohibition exists, however, the same effect can be obtained by the
                    use of consensual share transfer restrictions (see section 6.27). If it is possible to create what is essentially a callable voting share by agreement, there is no reason why such provisions should not be built directly and publicly
                    into the capital structure of the corporation if that is desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recognition of a redemption that is a “put” exercisable by the holders of the shares (or a third person such as holders of other classes of shares) is also new to the Model Act and is not permitted in many states. However, consensual share transfer
                    restrictions may create a right that is indistinguishable from such a right of redemption, and a right of redemption is expressly recognized by many states in connection with certain specialized classes of corporations such as open-end
                    investment companies. As described below, if a right of redemption is recognized, prohibitions in earlier versions of the Model Act and many state statutes against “upstream” conversions serve no purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount to be paid upon the redemption of shares under section 6.01(c)(2) may be fixed in the articles of incorporation or “determined in accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or events.” The reference to “extrinsic
                    data or events” is intended to permit the redemption price to be established on the basis of matters external to the corporation, such as the purchase price of other shares, the level of the prime rate, the effective interest rate
                    at which the corporation may obtain short- or long-term financing, the consumer price index or a designated currency ratio. While a designated price formula or references must be set out in the articles of incorporation, the board
                    of directors may be given limited authority to implement the provisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All redemptions of shares are subject to the restrictions on distributions set forth in section 6.40. See section 6.03(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01(c)(2) also permits shares of any class to be made convertible into shares of any other class or into cash, indebtedness, securities, or other property of the corporation or another person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As described above, earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states prohibit so-called “upstream” conversions, that is, shares convertible into debt securities or into a class of shares having prior or superior preference rights. See,
                    e.g., N.Y. BUS. CORP. LAW ANN. § 519(a)(1) (McKinney 1963). This restriction was eliminated from the Model Act since it was recognized that the power to make shares redeemable at the option of the shareholder for cash (see section
                    6.01(c)(2)(ii)) should logically permit the shares to be redeemable or convertible at the option of the shareholder into other shares with senior preferential rights. Creditors of the corporation and holders of shares with preferential
                    rights are less seriously affected by a conversion of shares into debt or into shares with preferential rights than they would be by the redemption of the shares for money, which is permitted by the revised Model Act, subject to the
                    limitations of section 6.40. Shares made “redeemable” for debt under section 6.01(c)(2)(ii), achieve the same effect as a right to “convert” shares into debt securities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Examples of classes of shares permitted by section 6.01
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.01 authorizes the creation of new or innovative classes of shares without limitation or restriction. The section is basically enabling rather than restrictive since corporations often find it necessary to create new and innovative classes of
                    shares for a variety of reasons, and with the disclosure of the terms of the new classes in the articles of incorporation that are a matter of public record there is no reason to restrict the power to create these classes. Innovative
                    classes of shares may be created in connection with raising debt or equity capital. Securities with novel provisions are often created to meet perceived corporate needs in specific circumstances or because of financial problems generated
                    by market conditions for capital. Novel classes of shares may also be created in order to effectuate desired control relationships among the participants in a venture. Classes of shares are likely to be used for this purpose in closely
                    held corporations, whether or not statutory close corporation status is elected, but may also be used for this purpose by publicly held corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Examples of innovative classes of shares are the following:

                </ol>
                <p>
                    (2) Shares of one class may be entitled to vote as a separate voting group on certain transactions, but shares of two or more classes may be only entitled to vote together as a single voting group on the election of directors and other matters.

                <p>
                    (3) Shares of one class may be nonvoting or may be given multiple or fractional votes per share.

                <p>
                    (4) Shares of one class may be entitled to different dividend rights or rights on dissolution than shares of another class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These examples are intended to be illustrative only and not to exhaust the variations permissible under the Model Act.

                <p>
                    A corporation has power to issue debt securities under section 3.02(7). Although section 6.01 authorizes the creation of interests that usually will be classed as “equity” rather than “debt,” it is permissible to create classes of securities under section
                    6.01 that have some of the characteristics of debt securities. These securities are often referred to as “hybrid securities.” Section 6.01 of the Model Act does not limit the development of hybrid securities, and equity securities
                    may be created under the Model Act that embody any characteristics of debt that may be desired. Unlike some state statutes, however, the Model Act restricts the power to vote to securities classed as “shares” in the articles of incorporation.

                    The Model Act was modified in this section to deal only with the kind of shares that are authorized and, in G.S. 55-6-02, to deal only with blank shares where the board of directors fixes or determines the terms of a series within a class of shares. The
                    Model Act blends these provisions by providing the authority to issue a series within a class in section 6.02 instead of section 6.01. Subsection (a) of this section incorporates subsection (b) of section 6.02 of the Model Act, slightly
                    modified for clarity, while subsection (c) of section 6.02 was incorporated as subsection (b) of this section.

                        Priorities of preferred stock are always subject to the rights of creditors. So an attempt of the corporation to give the preferred stockholders a lien upon its realty in the nature of a mortgage or deed of trust under the provisions of its charter is
                        ineffectual as to the prior rights of creditors. Ellington v. Raleigh Bldg. Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 784</cite>, 147 S.E. 307, 1929 N.C. LEXIS 109 (1929).

                <p>
                    Section 6.02 permits the board of directors, if authority to do so is contained in the articles, to fix the terms of a class of shares to meet corporate needs, including current requirements of the securities market or the exigencies of negotiations for
                    acquisition of other corporations or properties, without the necessity of holding a shareholders’ meeting to amend the articles. This section therefore permits prompt action and gives desirable flexibility. The articles of incorporation
                    may also create “series” of shares within a class (rather than designating that “series” as a separate class) if that is deemed desirable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board of directors may create new series within a class or set the terms of a class or series only if there are no outstanding shares of that class or series. This section recognizes that in some contexts there is no substantive difference between
                    a “class” and a “series within a class,” and that the labels are often a matter of convenience. In appropriate circumstances, a series may be treated as a class of shares that has one or both of the fundamental characteristics described
                    in section 6.01(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares of stock to be issued in different classes or series that vary in terms to be set by the board of directors are sometimes referred to as “blank stock.” The granting of the power to vary the terms gives the board of directors broad power to affect
                    the capital structure of the corporation. Exercise of this power may in some circumstances dilute the interest of existing shareholders. But on balance it is desirable to permit this flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The power to vary the terms of “blank stock” for series of the same class extends to all the permitted variables set forth in section 6.01(c).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (e) requires a simple official filing to amend the articles so there will be a public record of the class or series the corporation intends to issue. The amendment may be made without shareholder action. See section 10.02.

                    Section 6.03 permits the corporation to issue shares up to the number of shares authorized in the articles of incorporation and provides that shares that are issued are outstanding shares for purposes of this Act until they are reacquired, redeemed, converted,
                    or cancelled. The determination of the number of shares to be issued is usually made by the board of directors but may be reserved by the articles of incorporation to the shareholders. The only requirements are that no class of shares
                    be overissued and that one or more shares of a class or classes that together have unlimited voting power and one or more shares of a class or classes that together are entitled to the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution
                    at all times must be outstanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares of any class that are outstanding may be made subject to share transfer restrictions that may result in contractual obligations by the corporation to reacquire shares. The validity of such share transfer restriction is today not open to serious
                    question. See section 6.27. The corporation may also acquire outstanding shares of any class pursuant to a voluntary transaction between the shareholder and the corporation. All contractual or voluntary reacquisitions are subject to
                    the restrictions set forth in subsection (c) of this section and to section 6.40. The corporation may also reacquire shares pursuant to a right of redemption (or an obligation to redeem) established in the articles of incorporation.
                    See section 6.01(c)(2). All such redemptions of shares are also subject to the restrictions of subsection (c) of this section and to section 6.40. Shares of the class or classes described in section 6.01(b) may be reacquired or redeemed
                    by the corporation in any of the foregoing ways to the same extent as shares of any other class, subject, however, to the overriding requirement of section 6.03(c) that at all times at least shares that meet the requirements of section
                    6.01(b) be outstanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provisions of the revised Model Act are consistent with the specialized class of corporation known as the open-end investment company, which permits unlimited redemptions of shares at net asset value at the request of shareholders. Sections 6.01 and
                    6.03 permit the classes of shares with voting and dissolution rights to be made redeemable without limitation. The requirement of section 6.03(c) that at least one share be outstanding is also consistent with an unlimited right of
                    redemption since that section only applies while there are shares of stock outstanding. If an open-end investment company or any other corporation should redeem all of its outstanding shares, it should file articles of dissolution
                    under chapter 14 at or before the time the last share is redeemed.

                    Fractional shares may arise from a share dividend that, as applied to a particular holder, does not produce an even multiple of shares; they may also result from fractional stock splits, from reverse splits, and from reclassifications and mergers. Although
                    corporations are authorized to issue fractional shares, which are vested proportionately with the same rights as full shares, the creation of fractional shares often creates administrative difficulties, particularly for voting and
                    dividend purposes.

                    Section 6.04 authorizes handling fractional shares in various ways, including:

                        The corporation may issue scrip instead of fractional shares. Scrip confers none of the substantive rights of shareholders, but only authorizes holders to combine scrip certificates in amounts aggregating a full share and then to exchange them for a full
                        share. This aggregation must occur within the time and subject to the conditions set initially by the board of directors and stated in the scrip certificate. Scrip that is not combined and exchanged becomes void. To protect shareholders
                        against forfeiture of their interest, however, it is usually provided that the shares represented by scrip certificates not exchanged by the expiration date are to be sold and the proceeds held, either indefinitely or for a stated
                        period, for the benefit of the scripholders and paid to them on surrender of their scrip certificate.

                        The corporation may authorize the immediate sale of all fractional share interests, thereby avoiding the expense and delay of scrip and the inconvenience of recognizing fractional shares. While this procedure denies shareholders the benefit of any subsequent
                        rise in the market, it protects them against any subsequent decline and ensures them of recognition based on market values contemporaneous with the transaction. Since these transactions necessarily involve less than one full share
                        for each shareholder, the amount involved in subsequent price changes is usually modest.

                    Scrip has been widely used in lieu of fractional shares. The New York Stock Exchange, while not requiring the use of any particular method for the settlement of fractional share interests, has established a policy relating to the minimum rights and privileges
                    that scrip issued by registered companies must provide. N.Y.S.E. LISTED COMPANY MANUAL § 703.02(B).

                    One variation of “going private” transactions to eliminate public shareholders in a corporation largely owned by management interests involves a reverse share split at a ratio that reduces all public shareholders’ interest to a fractional share, followed
                    by the reduction of the fractional interests to cash under this section. See “Guidelines on Going Private,” 37 BUS. LAW. 313 (1981).

                <p>
                    Agreements for the purchase of shares to be issued by a corporation are typically referred to as “subscriptions” or “subscription agreements.” Section 6.20 deals exclusively with preincorporation subscriptions, that is, subscriptions entered into before
                    the corporation was formed. Preincorporation subscriptions have often been considered to be revocable offers rather than binding contracts. Since the corporation is not in existence, it cannot be a party to the agreement and the consideration
                    established for the shares is not determined by the board of directors. While preincorporation subscriptions entered into simultaneously by several subscribers may be considered a binding contract between or among the subscribers,
                    not all factual situations lend themselves to contractual analysis. Because of the uncertainty of the legal enforceability of these transactions, section 6.20 provides a simple set of legal rules applicable to the enforcement of preincorporation
                    subscriptions by the corporation after its formation. It does not address the extent to which preincorporation subscriptions may constitute a contract between or among subscribers, and other subscribers may enforce whatever contract
                    rights they have without regard to section 6.20.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.20(a) provides that preincorporation subscriptions are irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement provides that they are revocable or that they are irrevocable for some other period. Nevertheless, all the subscribers to shares
                    may agree at any time that a subscriber may withdraw in part from his commitment to subscribe for shares, that a subscriber may revoke his subscription entirely, or that the period of irrevocability may continue for an additional stated
                    period. If the corporation accepts the subscription during the period of irrevocability, the subscription becomes a contract binding on both the subscribers and the corporation. The terms of this contract are set forth in sections
                    6.20(b) and (d).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.20(b) provides that after incorporation the board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions but these calls must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series unless the subscriptions provide
                    otherwise. Section 6.20(d) provides alternative methods of enforcement of preincorporation subscriptions by the corporation. If the consideration for the subscription involves the payment of money or conveyance of property, the corporation
                    may, in the event of nonpayment, collect the amount due as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the agreement and may resell the shares after 20 days’ notice
                    to the subscriber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.20(c) provides that shares issued pursuant to preincorporation subscriptions are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the subscription price. The liability of the subscriber to pay the purchase price is addressed in section
                    6.22. Section 6.20 does not address the liability of transferees of shares which may be issued before the subscription price is paid for the power of the corporation to cancel for nonpayment shares that have been issued before payment
                    for the full subscription price. Issued shares represented by unpaid subscriptions are subject to cancellation for nonpayment to the same extent as shares issued for promissory notes or shares issued before the consideration therefor
                    is paid. See the Official Comment to sections 6.21 and 6.22.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post-incorporation subscriptions are contracts between the corporation and the investor by which the corporation agrees to issue shares for a stated consideration and the investor agrees to purchase the shares for that consideration. Post-incorporation
                    subscriptions are simple contracts subject to the power of the board of directors and they may contain any mutually acceptable provisions subject to section 6.21. Section 6.20(e) states, for completeness, that post-incorporation subscriptions
                    are contracts between the corporation and the subscriber subject to section 6.21.

                <p>
                    The financial provisions of the Model Act reflect a modernization of the concepts underlying the capital structure and limitations on distributions of corporations. This process of modernization began with amendments in 1980 to the 1969 Model Act that
                    eliminated the concepts of “par value” and “stated capital,” and further modernization occurred in connection with the development of the revised Act in 1984. Practitioners and legal scholars have long recognized that the statutory
                    structure embodying “par value” and “legal capital” concepts is not only complex and confusing but also fails to serve the original purpose of protecting creditors and senior security holders from payments to junior security holders.
                    Indeed, to the extent security holders are led to believe that it provides this protection, these provisions may be affirmatively misleading. The Model Act has therefore eliminated these concepts entirely and substituted a simpler
                    and more flexible structure that provides more realistic protection to these interests. Major aspects of this new structure are:

                <p>
                    Since shares need not have a par value, under section 6.21 there is no minimum price at which specific shares must be issued and therefore there can be no “watered stock” liability for issuing shares below an arbitrarily fixed price. The price at which
                    shares are issued is primarily a matter of concern to other shareholders whose interests may be diluted if shares are issued at unreasonably low prices or for overvalued property. This problem of equality of treatment essentially involves
                    honest and fair judgments by directors and cannot be effectively addressed by an arbitrary doctrine establishing a minimum price for shares such as “par value” provided under older statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.21(b) specifically validates contracts for future services (including promoters’ services), promissory notes, or “any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation,” as consideration for the present issue of shares. The term
                    “benefit” should be broadly construed to include, for example, a reduction of a liability, a release of a claim, or benefits obtained by a corporation by contribution of its shares to a charitable organization or as a prize in a promotion.
                    In the realities of commercial life, there is sometimes a need for the issuance of shares for contract rights or such intangible property or benefits. And, as a matter of business economics, contracts for future services, promissory
                    notes, and intangible property or benefits often have value that is as real as the value of tangible property or past services, the only types of property that many older statutes permit as consideration for shares. Thus, only business
                    judgment should determine what kind of property should be obtained for shares, and a determination by the directors meeting the requirements of section 8.30 to accept a specific kind of valuable property for shares should be accepted
                    and not circumscribed by artificial or arbitrary rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issuance of some shares for cash and other shares for promissory notes, contracts for past or future services, or for tangible or intangible property or benefits, like the issuance of shares for an inadequate consideration, opens the possibility of
                    dilution of the interests of other shareholders. For example, persons acquiring shares for cash may be unfairly treated if optimistic values are placed on past or future services or intangible benefits being provided by other persons.
                    The problem is particularly acute if the persons providing services, promissory notes, or property or benefits of debatable value are themselves connected with the promoters of the corporation or with its directors. Protection of shareholders
                    against abuse of the power granted to the board of directors to determine that shares should be issued for intangible property or benefits is provided in part by the requirement that the board must act in accordance with the requirements
                    of section 8.30, and, if applicable, section 8.31, in determining that the consideration received for shares is adequate, and in part by the requirement of section 16.21 that the corporation must inform all shareholders annually of
                    all shares issued during the previous year for promissory notes or promises of future services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accounting principles are not specified in the Model Act, and the board of directors is not required by the statute to determine the “value” of noncash consideration received by the corporation (as was the case in earlier versions of the Model Act). In
                    many instances, property or benefit received by the corporation will be of uncertain value; if the board of directors determines that the issuance of shares for the property or benefit is an appropriate transaction that protects the
                    shareholders from dilution, that is sufficient under section 6.21. The board of directors does not have to make an explicit “adequacy” determination by formal resolution; that determination may be inferred from a determination to authorize
                    the issuance of shares for a specified consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.21 also does not require that the board of directors determine the value of the consideration to be entered on the books of the corporation, though the board of directors may do so if it wishes. Of course, a specific value must be placed on
                    the consideration received for the shares for bookkeeping purposes, but bookkeeping details are not the statutory responsibility of the board of directors. The statute also does not require the board of directors to determine the corresponding
                    entry on the right-hand side of the balance sheet under owner’s equity to be designated as “stated capital” or be allocated among “stated capital” and other surplus accounts. The corporation, however, may determine that the shareholders’
                    equity accounts should be divided into these traditional categories if it wishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second sentence of section 6.21(c) describes the effect of the determination by the board of directors that consideration is adequacy for the issuance of shares. That determination, without more, is conclusive to the extent that adequacy is relevant
                    to the question whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. Section 6.21(c) provides that shares are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors
                    authorized their issuance. Whether shares are validly issued may depend on compliance with corporate procedural requirements, such as issuance within the amount authorized in the articles of incorporation or holding a directors’ meeting
                    upon proper notice and with a quorum present. The Model Act does not address the remedies that may be available for issuances that are subject to challenge. This somewhat more elaborate clause replaces the provision in earlier versions
                    of the Model Act and many state statutes that the determination by the board of directors of consideration for the issuance of shares was “conclusive in the absence of fraud in the transaction.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares issued pursuant to preincorporation subscriptions are governed by section 6.20 and not this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The revised Model Act does not address the question whether validly issued shares may thereafter be cancelled on the grounds of fraud or bad faith if the shares are in the hands of the original shareholder or other persons who were aware of the circumstances
                    under which they were issued when they acquired the shares. It also leaves to the Uniform Commercial Code other questions relating to the rights of persons other than the person acquiring the shares from the corporation. See the Official
                    Commercial to section 6.22.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.21(e) permits the board of directors to determine that shares issued for promissory notes or for contracts for future services or benefits be placed in escrow or their transfer otherwise restricted until the services are performed, the benefits
                    received, or the notes are paid. The section also defines the rights of the corporation with respect to these shares. If the shares are issued without being restricted as provided in this subsection, they are validly issued insofar
                    as the adequacy of consideration is concerned. See section 6.22 and its Official Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.21(a) provides that the powers granted to the board of directors by this section may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation. No negative inference should be drawn from section 6.21(a) with respect to the efficacy of
                    similar provisions under other sections of the Model Act.

                    Except for a minor stylistic change, this section is identical to section 6.21 of the Model Act. It differs in three main respects from former G.S. 55-46. First, the provisions of this section do not tie the minimum amount of consideration that must be
                    received upon the issuance of the shares to their par or stated value. Second, the form that such consideration may take has been expanded to include future services and promissory notes, which were prohibited by former G.S. 55-46(b).
                    Third, the board of directors is no longer required to state its determination of the fair value to the corporation of noncash consideration paid for shares; it is required only to determine that the noncash consideration is adequate.

                        It is not essential to a bona fide subscription to stock in a corporation that there be a present payment in cash by the subscriber, or that he be solvent; a subscription is considered bona fide whenever made by one who subscribes in good faith, with

                <p>
                    With the elimination of the concepts of par value and watered stock in 1980, the sole obligation of a purchaser of shares from the corporation, as set forth in section 6.22(a), is to pay the consideration established by the board of directors (or the
                    consideration specified in the subscription, in the case of pre-incorporation subscriptions). The consideration for the shares may consist of promissory notes, contracts for future services, or tangible or intangible property or benefits,
                    and, if the board of directors so decide, the delivery of the notes, contracts, or accrual of the benefits constitutes full payment for the shares. See the Official Comment to section 6.21. Upon the transfer to the corporation of the
                    consideration so determined or specified, the shareholder has no further responsibility to the corporation or its creditors “with respect to the shares,” though the shareholder may have continuing obligations under a contract or promissory
                    note entered into in connection with the acquisition of shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.22(a) deals only with the responsibility for payment by the purchaser of shares from the corporation. The revised Model Act leaves to the Uniform Commercial Code questions with respect to the rights of subsequent purchasers of shares and the
                    power of the corporation to cancel shares if the consideration is not paid when due. See sections 8-202 and 8-301 of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.22(b) sets forth the basic rule of nonliability of shareholders for corporate acts or debts that underlies modern corporation law. Unless such liability is provided for in the articles of incorporation, see section 2.02(b)(v), shareholders are
                    not liable for corporate obligations, though the last clause recognizes that such liability may be assumed voluntarily or by other conduct.

                        Corporation’s appeal of the denial of its motion for summary judgment, which argued that the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act precluded an administratrix’s negligence claims against it, was dismissed because it could not be determined whether

                <p>
                    A share dividend is solely a paper transaction: No assets are received by the corporation for the shares and any “dividend” paid in shares does not involve the distribution of property by the corporation to its shareholders. Section 6.23 therefore recognizes
                    that such a transaction involves the issuance of shares “without consideration,” and section 1.40(6) excludes it from the definition of a “distribution.” Such transactions were treated in a fictional way under the old “par value” and
                    “stated capital” statutes, which treated a share dividend as involving transfers from a surplus account to stated capital and assumed that par value shares could be issued without receiving any consideration by reason of that transfer
                    of surplus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The par value statutory treatment of share dividend transactions distinguished a share “split” from a dividend. In a share “split” the par value of the former shares was divided among the new shares and there was no transfer of surplus into the stated
                    capital account as in the case of a share “dividend.” Since the Model Act has eliminated the concept of par value, the distinction between a “split” and a “dividend” has not been retained and both types of transactions are referred
                    to simply as “share dividends.” A distinction between “share dividends” and “share splits,” however, continues to exist in other contexts—for example, in connection with transactions by publicly held corporations, see N.Y.S.E. LISTED
                    COMPANY MANUAL § 703.02(a), or corporations that have optionally retained par value for their shares. The change made in the Model Act is not intended to affect the manner in which transactions by these corporations are handled or
                    described but simply reflects the elimination of artificial legal distinctions based on the par value statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A “reversed stock split” is not a share dividend under this section of the Model Act. A reverse split involves an amendment to the articles of incorporation reducing the number of authorized shares, not the issuance of additional shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Share dividends may create problems when a corporation has more than a single class of shares. The requirement that a share dividend be “pro rata” only applies to shares of the same class or series; if there are two or more classes entitled to receive
                    a share dividend in different proportions, the dividend will have to be allocated appropriately.

                    The distribution of shares of one class to holders of another class may dilute the equity of the holders of the first class. Therefore, subsection (b) permits the distribution of shares of one class to the holders of another class only if one or more
                    of the following conditions are met: (1) the articles of incorporation expressly authorize the transaction, (2) the holders of the class being distributed consent to the distribution, or (3) there are no holders of the class being
                    distributed.

                <p>
                    A specific provision authorizing the creation of share options and share rights appears in many states statutes. Even though corporations doubtless have the inherent power to issue share options and share rights, specific authorization is desirable because
                    of the economic importance of options and rights, and because of the need to establish the primacy of the board of directors in determining the consideration received by the corporation for rights and options. The creation of incentive
                    compensation plans for directors, officers, agents, and employees is basically a matter of business judgment and the good faith determination by the board of directors should therefore be conclusive. This is as true for incentive plans
                    that involve the issuance of share options or rights as for those that involve the payment of cash. In appropriate cases incentive plans may involve the granting of options at prices below the current market prices of the shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.24 does not require shareholder approval of share options or rights as incentive plans. Of course, prior shareholder approval may be required as a discretionary matter, in order to comply with the requirements of national security exchanges
                    for the listing of securities, see N.Y.S.E. LISTED COMPANY MANUAL § 309.00, or to acquire the benefits of federal law conditioned upon shareholder approval of such plans, see S.E.C. Rule 16b-3(a), 17 C.F.R. § 240.16b-3(a).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reference to the “form” of a right, option, or warrant in section 6.24 permits the board of directors to designate the interest issued under section 6.24 as options, warrants, rights, or by some other name, and to evidence these interests by certificates,
                    contracts, letter agreements, or in other forms that are appropriate under the circumstances. Rights, options, or warrants may be issued together with or independently of the corporation’s issue and sale of its shares or other securities.

                <p>
                    Some publicly held corporations have delegated administration of programs involving incentive compensation in the form of share rights or options to compensation committees composed of nonmanagement directors, subject to the general authority of the board
                    of directors.

                    Subsection (a) is identical to section 6.24 of the Model Act and is intended to be very broad in authorizing the creation and issuance of options, convertible securities and rights to acquire shares and other kinds of securities and property. The Model
                    Act’s catchline for the section was changed to reflect this broad scope. Unlike former G.S. 55-45(a), the statute itself does not require shareholder approval of any options granted thereunder; but, as noted in the Official Comment,
                    such approval may be required by other rules or regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (b) contains special provisions that do not appear in either the prior law or the Model Act and are designed to eliminate uncertainty as to the validity of certain rights plans created by companies with a class of securities registered under
                    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such plans usually contain features that might otherwise be held to violate the letter or intent of the corporate statute as a whole. Specifically, the rights plans typically used as defenses to
                    hostile takeovers (called “poison pills”) create purchase or conversion rights that are not exercisable in the hands of a hostile bidder. Without explicit statutory language to the contrary, for example, such a discriminatory feature
                    might be held to violate the requirement of G.S. 55-6-01 that all shares of the same class have the same rights, or the requirement of G.S. 55-6-23(a) that share dividends be issued pro rata. The drafters were of that view that rights
                    plans should not be generally prohibited. Several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Hawaii, have adopted explicit validating language similar to that included in this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last sentence of subsection (b) was included to make it clear that the broad enabling language of the subsection was not intended to eliminate or limit the directors’ duty, under G.S. 55-8-30(a) and otherwise, to act in good faith, with due care and
                    in the best interests of the corporation. Thus, their action in creating and using a “poison pill” as a defensive device would be subject to judicial review in an appropriate proceeding in which the court may formulate or apply appropriate
                    standards to insure that the directors’ actions are in the best long-term interests and short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders considering, without limitation, the prospects for potential growth, development,
                    productivity and profitability of the corporation.

                <p>
                    This section sets forth the minimum requirements for share certificates. A corporation whose shares are not publicly traded will normally issue certificates that meet these minimum requirements and little more. Securities that are publicly traded, on
                    the other hand, must contain reasonable safeguards against fraudulent duplication; for this reason, regulations by exchanges contain technical requirements relating to design, workmanship, engraving, and printing. Also, exchange requirements
                    may require signatures of a transfer agent and registrar as well as designated corporate officers. All these requirements are in addition to the minimum requirements of the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certificateless shares are permitted under section 6.25(a) upon compliance with section 6.26. Section 6.25(a) makes it clear that there are no differences in the rights and obligations of shareholders, whether or not their shares are represented by certificates,
                    other than mechanical differences, such as the means by which instructions for transfer are communicated to the issuer, necessitated by the use or nonuse of certificates. If share transfer restrictions are imposed, conspicuous references
                    must appear on the certificate if they are to be binding on third persons without knowledge of the restrictions. See section 6.27.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 6.25 all signatures on a share certificate may be facsimiles. This change, which has been adopted recently in several states, gives recognition to the fact that a purchaser of publicly traded shares will hardly ever be in a position to determine
                    whether a manual signature on a stock certificate is in fact the authorized signature of an officer or the transfer agent or registrar. From the standpoint of the issuing corporation of publicly traded securities, if a share certificate
                    requiring a manual signature is stolen and the signature thereafter forged, the corporation may defend on lack of genuineness under section 8-202(3) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. But this defense is not effective against a bona fide
                    purchaser when the forged signature has been placed on the certificate by an employee of the issuer or registrar or transfer agent entrusted with handling the certificates (UCC § 8-205). It is likely that a corporation would therefore
                    follow the same security precautions for blank certificates requiring manual signatures as for those not requiring them. At the same time, the time and expense required for manual signatures has been eliminated.

                    This section and G.S. 55-6-26 authorize the issuance of uncertificated shares, which is a major change from the former law. Except for the addition of the words “in any capacity” to subsection (e) to make it clear that transfer agents and registrars are
                    covered by the section, the section is identical to section 6.25 of the Model Act. Article 8 of the North Carolina UCC has been amended to add provisions dealing with uncertificated shares.

                    Section 6.26(a) authorizes the creation of uncertificated shares either by original issue or in substitution for shares previously represented by certificates. This subsection gives the board of directors the widest discretion so that a particular class
                    and series of shares might be entirely represented by certificates, entirely uncertificated, or represented partly by each. The second sentence ensures that a corporation may not treat as uncertificated, and accordingly transferable
                    on its books without due presentation of a certificate, any shares for which a certificate is outstanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The statement required by section 6.26(b) ensures that holders of uncertificated shares will receive from the corporation the same information that the holders of certificates receive when certificates are issued. There is no requirement that this information
                    be delivered to purchasers of uncertificated shares before purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detailed rules with respect to the issuance, transfer, and registration of both certificated and uncertificated shares appear in article 8 of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. In general terms there are no differences between certificated and uncertificated
                    securities except in matters such as their manner of transfer. See the Official Comment to section 6.25.

                    Share transfer restrictions are widely used by both publicly held and closely held corporations for a variety of appropriate purposes. Although most courts have upheld reasonable share transfer restrictions, a few have rigidly followed the common law
                    rule that they constituted restraints on alienation and should be strictly construed. As a result, some cases have invalidated restrictions outright or construed them narrowly so as not to cover specific transfers. By prescribing reasonable
                    rules to govern the use of transfer restrictions, section 6.27 should guide practitioners in their use and encourage a more uniform and favorable judicial reception.

                    Section 6.27(a) generally authorizes the imposition of transfer restrictions on “shares,” although the caption of the section refers to “shares and other securities.” Section 6.27(e) defines “shares” for purposes of section 6.27 to include securities
                    “convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares;” the phrase “other securities” in the title thus describes the broader scope of this section resulting from the definition in section 6.27(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Share transfer restrictions are usually created by provisions in the bylaws or articles of incorporation but may also be created by contract between the corporation and some or all the shareholders or between or among the shareholders themselves. However,
                    if shares are originally issued free of restriction, they may not thereafter be subjected to a transfer restriction without the consent of the holder, evidenced by a vote in favor of the amendment to the articles or bylaws creating
                    the restriction, or by being a party to the contract creating the restriction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The terms of a restriction on transfer do not need to be set forth in full or summarized in detail on a certificate or information statement required by section 6.26(b) for uncertificated securities. Rather, section 6.27(b) provides that in the case of
                    a certificated security, the existence of the restriction must be conspicuously set forth on the front or back of the certificate; in the case of an uncertificated security, the existence of the restriction must be noted in the information
                    statement. There is no requirement that the notation on an information statement be conspicuous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a transferee knows of the restriction he is bound by it even though the restriction is not noted on the certificate or information statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.27(c) describes the purposes for which restrictions may be imposed while section 6.27(d) describes the types of restrictions that may be imposed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.27(c) enumerates certain purposes for which share transfer restrictions may be imposed, but does not limit the purposes since section 6.27(c)(3) permits restrictions “for any other reasonable purpose.” Examples of the “status” referred to in
                    section 6.27(c)(1) are the election of close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement, the subchapter S election under the Internal Revenue Code, and entitlement to a program or eligibility for a privilege
                    administered by governmental agencies or national securities exchanges. Specific references in section 6.27 to subchapter S and other statutes were not made because of the possibility that the Internal Revenue Code or other statute
                    may be amended or recodified after the adoption of the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.27(c)(2) permits restrictions on transfers of shares to ensure availability of exemptions under state or federal securities acts. Share transfer restrictions for other purposes are permitted by section 6.23(c)(3) so long as the purpose is reasonable.
                    It is unnecessary to inquire into the reasonableness of the purposes specifically enumerated in section 6.27(c)(1) and (2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The types of restrictions referred to in section 6.27(d)(1) (buy-sell agreements) and (2) (option agreements) are imposed as a matter of contractual negotiation and do not prohibit the outright transfer of shares. Rather, they designate to whom shares
                    or other securities must be offered at a price established in the agreement or by a formula or method agreed to in advance. By contrast, the restrictions described in sections 6.27(d)(3) and (4) may permanently limit the market for
                    shares by disqualifying all or some potential purchasers. As a result the restrictions imposed by these two provisions must not be “manifestly unreasonable.”

                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) by inserting the language “it is not unconscionable under the circumstances.” This modification addressed a concern that the Model Act’s section 6.27 may allow the enforcement of unconscionable restrictions.
                    The drafters noted that the Model Act’s language in section 6.27 may not allow judicial discretion in a situation where there was initially a reasonable purpose in imposing a restriction but over time the effect of the restriction
                    had become unreasonable because of a change in circumstances. Judicial discretion would allow a court in such a situation to judge the restriction at the time its validity and enforceability are questioned. The amendment does not represent
                    an attempt to change the prior law in North Carolina with respect to unconscionable agreements, but rather to preserve expressly the equitable power of the courts to deny enforcement of agreements that are unconscionable under the
                    circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (b) was also modified so that a restriction on transfer not noted on the certificate or in the information statement is enforceable only against a person who received actual written notice of the restriction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The introductory language of subsection (d) was modified for clarity. Subdivision (d)(5) was added to clarify that subdivisions (1) through (4) are not exclusive. The use of the word “reasonably” in this subsection was not thought to conflict with the
                    “unconscionable” language in subsection (b), because the two subsections have different purposes.

                    The original purpose of this section was to deal with the problems created by the concepts of “par value” and “stated capital;” it permitted the corporation to expend its capital for “the reasonable charges and expenses of ” organization without fear
                    of making the shares not fully paid or assessable because the assets were reduced below the aggregate par value of the issued shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the modern capitalization principles set forth in the Model Act (see the Official Comment to section 6.21), there is no basis for the fear that shares issued properly under section 6.21 can be made assessable because of the subsequent use of the
                    proceeds. While section 6.28 thus may be technically unnecessary, it was believed to be desirable to retain in the Model Act a general authorization to the corporation to pay its expenses of formation and raising capital out of its
                    original capitalization. The reference to “reasonable” charges and expenses was deleted on the theory that the test for these expenses should be no different from the test for expenses of any other type.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concluding language in the original Model Act, “without rendering the shares not fully paid or assessable,” was also deleted as unnecessary and confusing in the context of the revisions to the financial provisions of the Model Act.

                <p>
                    Section 6.30(a) adopts an “opt in” provision for preemptive rights: Unless an affirmative reference to these rights appears in the articles of incorporation, no preemptive rights exist. Whether or not preemptive rights are elected, however, the directors’
                    fiduciary duties extend to the issuance of shares. Issuance of shares at favorable prices to directors (but excluding other shareholders) or the issuance of shares on a nonproportional basis for the purpose of affecting control rather
                    than raising capital may violate that duty. These duties, it is believed, form a more rational structure of regulation than the technical principles of traditional preemptive rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.30(b) provides a standard model for preemptive rights if the corporation desires to exercise the “opt in” alternative of section 6.30(a). The simple phrase, “the corporation elects to have preemptive rights,” or words of similar import, results
                    in the rest of subsection (b) becoming applicable to the corporation. But a corporation may qualify or limit any of the rules set forth in subsection (b) by express provisions in the articles of incorporation if the rules are felt
                    to be undesirable or inappropriate for the specific corporation. The purposes of this standard model for preemptive rights are (1) to simplify drafting articles of incorporation and (2) to provide a simple checklist of business considerations
                    for the benefit of attorneys who are considering the inclusion of preemptive rights in articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provisions of sections 6.30(b) establish rules for most of the problems involving preemptive rights. Thus subsection (b)(1) defines the general scope of the preemptive right giving appropriate recognition to the discretion of the board of directors
                    in establishing the terms and conditions for exercise of that right. Subsection (b)(2) creates rules with respect to the waiver of these rights. Subsection (b)(3) lists the principal exceptions to preemptive rights, including a six-month
                    period during which initial capital can be raised by a newly formed corporation without regard to the preemptive rights of persons who have previously acquired shares. Subsections (b)(4) and (b)(5) provide rules for the often-difficult
                    problems created when preemptive rights are recognized in corporations with more than a single class of shares. These problems are discussed further below. Subsection (b)(6) defines the status of preemptive rights after a shareholder
                    has elected not to exercise a proffered preemptive right: for a period of one year thereafter the corporation may dispose of the shares at the same or a higher price. A corporation deciding to offer shares at a lower price must reoffer
                    the shares preemptively to the shareholders before selling them to third persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As indicated above, any portion of section 6.30(b) that is felt not to be appropriate for a specific corporation may be amended or deleted by appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model provision dealing with preemptive rights in section 6.30(b) is primarily designed to protect voting power within the corporation from dilution. For this reason, section 6.30(c) contains a special definition of “shares” to ensure that the preemptive
                    rights of shareholders, if these rights are granted, apply to all securities that are convertible into or carry a right to acquire voting shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, preemptive rights also may serve in part the function of protecting the equity participation of shareholders. This combination of functions creates no problem in a corporation that has authorized only a single class of shares but may
                    occasionally create problems in corporations with more complex capital structures. In many multiple-class corporate financial structures, the issuance of additional shares of one class does not adversely affect other classes. For example,
                    the issuance of additional general voting shares without preferential rights normally does not affect either the limited voting power or equity participation of holders of shares with preferential rights; holders of shares with preferential
                    equity participation rights but without general voting rights should therefore have no preemptive rights with respect to general voting shares without preferential rights. See subsections (b)(4) and (b)(5). Classes of shares that may
                    give rise to possible conflict between the protection of voting interests and equity participation when the board of directors desires to issue additional shares include classes of nonvoting shares without preferential rights and classes
                    of shares with both preferential rights to distributions and general voting rights. Attorneys who draft articles of incorporation with classes of shares that may give rise to these conflicts should consider the precise application
                    of section 6.30(b) with respect to preemptive rights for these classes and define more carefully the scope of the preemptive rights desired.

                    For corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 1990, this section adopts an “opt in” election for preemptive rights. In contrast to the prior law, unless an affirmative reference to these rights appears in the articles of incorporation, no preemptive
                    rights exist. Former G.S. 55-56 provided for preemptive rights unless limited or denied by the articles of incorporation. Subsection (d) grants preemptive rights under this section to shareholders of corporations incorporated before

                    to shares of another class.

                    The elimination of the concepts of “par value” and “stated capital” in the 1980 amendments to the Model Act (see the Official Comment to section 6.21) permitted the simplification of a number of other sections of the Act and the elimination of several
                    historical concepts that primarily served the purpose of ameliorating problems created by retention of the concepts of “par value” and “stated capital.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    One concept eliminated by the 1980 amendments was that of treasury shares. The status of once-issued but reacquired shares was an uneasy one under the traditional statutes. It was universally recognized that a corporation’s shares in its own hands are
                    not an asset any more than authorized but unissued shares. As an economic matter payments made by a corporation to repurchase its own shares must be viewed as a distribution of corporate assets by the corporation rather than as an
                    acquisition of an asset. Further, conventional statutes gave treasury shares an intermediate status between issued and unissued: they were treated as outstanding shares for some purposes, and they could be resold or disposed of by
                    the corporation (presumably) without regard to restrictions that might be imposed on the original issuance of shares by the corporation. Finally, the accounting treatment for treasury shares was complex, confusing, and to some extent
                    unrealistic since the capital accounts often did not reflect transactions in treasury shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the 1980 revisions of the financial provisions in the Model Act the concept of treasury shares is unnecessary. Authorized but unissued shares of the corporation may be issued on the same basis and with the same freedom as treasury shares under earlier
                    statutes. Attorneys’ opinions on the legality of the issuance of shares under the revised Model Act will therefore be unaffected by the elimination of the technical distinction between original shares and treasury shares. A possible
                    exception to these statements is that the concept of treasury shares may have permitted listed companies to save modestly on stock exchange listing fees in some cases that may not be available under the revised Model Act provisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.31(a) restates the fundamental power of a corporation to reacquire its own shares. Such a transaction constitutes a “distribution” by the corporation (see the definition of that term in section 1.40) and is subject to the limitations of section
                    6.40.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares that are reacquired by the corporation become authorized but unissued shares under section 6.31(b) unless the articles prohibit reissue, in which event they are cancelled. Section 6.31(c) requires a simplified official filing to reflect the reduction
                    of authorized shares. This provision is included in order that there be a public record of the number of authorized shares that a corporation may issue. The amendment may be made without shareholder action. See section 10.02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until the amendment referred to in section 6.31(c) is effective, the corporation has power to reissue the reacquired shares despite a prohibition in the articles of incorporation. In such a case, the action of the directors in issuing the shares may be
                    challengeable but the shares so issued would be fully paid and nonassessable if issued in conformity with section 6.21.

                        The 1985 amendment to former G.S. 55-52 was established to enable corporations to enter into written agreements with shareholders at the outset of the relationship for the issuance of stock redeemable at the shareholder’s option. The statute was not designed
                        to simply allow the corporation to enter into a written agreement with a shareholder to redeem stock out of and as an impairment to stated capital, which stock was already being held by the shareholder as common stock; rather,
                        the purpose was to provide a new method for North Carolina corporations to raise needed capital by readily available cash infusions from shareholders in exchange for stock redeemable at their request. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99

                        Where former shareholder had a note in exchange for the redemption of his shares in corporation, the note was unenforceable under former G.S. 55-52, as subdivision (c)(3), rather than subdivision (b)(4) thereof, applied. First, subdivision (b)(4) was
                        an amendment to the original provision and was effective in 1985, while the agreement between former shareholder and debtor corporation was executed before the amendment was in effect; second, subdivision (b)(4) was established
                        to enable corporations to enter agreements with shareholders for the issuance of stocks. In the instant case former shareholder and debtor entered into a written agreement some ten years after the issuance of the shares for the
                        sale of the common stock which former shareholder owned. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99 B.R. 703, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1591 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1989).

                    The reformulation of the statutory standards governing distributions is another important change made by the 1980 revisions to the financial provisions of the Model Act. It has long been recognized that the traditional “par value” and “stated capital”
                    statutes do not provide significant protection against distributions of capital to shareholders. While most of these statutes contained elaborate provisions establishing “stated capital,” “capital surplus,” and “earned surplus” (and
                    often other types of surplus as well), the net effect of most statutes was to permit the distribution to shareholders of most or all of the corporation’s net assets — its capital along with its earnings — if the shareholders wished
                    this to be done. However, statutes also generally imposed an equity insolvency test on distributions that prohibited distributions of assets if the corporation was insolvent or if the distribution had the effect of making the corporation
                    insolvent or unable to meet its obligations as they were projected to arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The financial provisions of the revised Model Act, which are based on the 1980 amendments, sweep away all the distinctions among the various types of surplus but retain restrictions on distributions built around both the traditional equity insolvency
                    and balance sheet tests of earlier statutes.

                    Section 1.40 defines “distribution” to include virtually all transfers of money, indebtedness of the corporation or other property to a shareholder in respect of the corporation’s shares. It thus includes cash or property dividends, payments by a corporation
                    to purchase its own shares, distributions of promissory notes or indebtedness, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation or voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Section 1.40 excludes from the definition of “distribution”
                    transactions by the corporation in which only its own shares are distributed to its shareholders. These transactions are called “share dividends” in the revised Model Business Corporation Act. See section 6.23.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40 imposes a single, uniform test on all distributions. Many of the old “par value” and “stated capital” statutes provided tests that varied with the type of distribution under consideration or did not cover certain types of distributions at
                    all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As noted above, older statutes prohibited payment of dividends if the corporation was, or as a result of the payment would be, insolvent in the equity sense. This test is retained, appearing in section 6.40(c)(1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For an on-going business enterprise the equity insolvency test requires that decisions be based on a cash flow analysis that is itself based on a business forecast and budget for a sufficient period of time to permit a conclusion that known obligations
                    of the corporation can reasonably be expected to be satisfied over the period of time that they will mature. It is not sufficient simply to measure current assets against current liabilities, or determine that the present estimated
                    “liquidation” value of the corporation’s assets would produce sufficient funds to satisfy the corporation’s existing liabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In determining whether a corporation is, or as a result of a proposed distribution would be rendered, insolvent, the board of directors may rely on information supplied by the officers of the corporation. It is not necessary for them to know of the details
                    of the cash flow analysis if the proposed distribution involves no significant risk of equity insolvency. Judgments, further, must of necessity be made on the basis of information in the hands of the board of directors when a distribution
                    is authorized. See section 8.30.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The revised Model Business Corporation Act establishes the validity of distributions from the corporate law standpoint under section 6.40 and determines the potential liability of directors for improper distributions under sections 8.30 and 8.33. The
                    federal Bankruptcy Act and state fraudulent conveyance statutes, on the other hand, are designed to enable the trustee or other representative to recapture for the benefit of creditors funds distributed to others in some circumstances.
                    In light of these diverse purposes, it was not thought necessary to make the tests of section 6.40 identical with the tests for insolvency under these various statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(c)(2) requires that, after giving effect to any distribution, the corporation’s assets equal or exceed its liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. Section 6.40(d) authorizes asset and
                    liability determinations to be made for this purpose on the basis of either (1) financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or (2) a fair valuation or other
                    method that is reasonable in the circumstances. The determination of a corporation’s assets and liabilities and the choice of the permissible basis on which to do so are left to the judgment of its board of directors. In making a judgment
                    under section 6.40(d), the board may rely under section 8.30 upon opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data prepared or presented by public accountants or others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40 does not incorporate technical accounting terminology and specific accounting concepts. Accounting terminology and concepts are constantly under review and subject to revision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute
                    of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and others. In making determinations under this section, the board of directors may make judgments about accounting matters, taking into account its right to
                    rely upon professional or expert opinion and its obligation to be reasonably informed as to pertinent standards of importance that bear upon the subject at issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a corporation with subsidiaries, the board of directors may rely on unconsolidated statements prepared on the basis of the equity method of accounting (see American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, APB Opinion No. 18 (1971)) as to the corporation’s
                    investee corporations, including corporate joint ventures and subsidiaries, although other evidence would be relevant in the total determination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The directors will normally be entitled to use generally accepted accounting principles and to give presumptive weight to the advice of professional accountants with respect to their application. But section 6.40 only requires the use of accounting practices
                    and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, and does not constitute a statutory enactment of generally accepted accounting principles. The widespread controversy concerning various accounting principles, and their continuous
                    reevaluation, suggest that a statutory standard of reasonableness, rather than of generally accepted accounting principles, is appropriate. The Model Act does not reject generally accepted accounting principles; on the contrary, it
                    is expected that their use will be the basic rule in most cases. The statutory language does, however, require informed business judgment applying particular accounting principles to the entire circumstances that exist at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a corporation’s financial statements are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a board of directors should normally consider the extent to which the assets may not be fairly stated or the liabilities may be understated
                    in determining the aggregate amount of assets and liabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(d) specifically permits determinations to be made under section 6.40(c)(2) on the basis of a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. Thus the statute authorizes departures from historical cost accounting and
                    sanctions the use of appraisal methods to determine the funds available for distributions. No particular method of valuation is prescribed in the statute, since different methods may have validity depending upon the circumstances,
                    including the type of enterprise and the purpose for which the determination is made. For example, it is inappropriate to apply a “quick-sale liquidation” value to an enterprise in most cases, particularly with respect to the payment
                    of normal dividends. On the other hand, a “quick-sale valuation” might be appropriate in certain circumstances for an enterprise in the course of liquidation or of reducing its asset or business base by a material degree. In most cases,
                    a fair valuation method or a going-concern basis would be appropriate if it is believed that the enterprise will continue as a going concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In determining the value of assets, all of the assets of a corporation, whether or not reflected in the financial statements (e.g., a valuable executory contract), should be considered. Ordinarily a corporation should not selectively revalue assets. Likewise,
                    all of a corporation’s obligations and commitments should be considered and quantified to the extent appropriate and possible. In any event, section 6.40(d) imposes upon the board of directors the responsibility of applying under section
                    6.40(c)(2) a method of determining the aggregate amounts of assets and liabilities that is reasonable in the circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(d) also refers to some “other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.” This phrase is inserted to comprehend within section 6.40(c)(2) the wide variety of possibilities that might not be considered to fall under a “fair valuation”
                    but might be reasonable in the circumstances of a particular case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Preferential dissolution rights and the balance sheet test
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(c)(2) provides that a distribution may not be made unless the total assets of the corporation exceed its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy any shareholders’ superior preferential rights upon dissolution if the corporation
                    were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution. This requirement in effect treats preferential dissolution rights of classes or series of shares for distribution purposes as equivalent to liabilities rather than as equity interests,
                    and carries forward analogous treatment of shares having preferential dissolution rights from earlier versions of the Model Act. In making the calculation of the amount that must be added to the liabilities of the corporation to reflect
                    the preferential dissolution rights, the assumption should be made that the preferential dissolution rights are to be established pursuant to the articles of incorporation (or resolution creating a series having preferential dissolution
                    rights) as of the date of the distribution or proposed distribution. The amount so determined must include arrearages in preferential dividends if the articles of incorporation or resolution require that they be paid upon the dissolution
                    of the corporation. In the case of shares having both a preferential right upon dissolution and additional nonpreferential rights, only the preferential portion of the rights should be taken into account. The treatment of preferential
                    dissolution rights of classes of shares set forth in section 6.40(c)(2) is applicable only to the balance sheet test and is not applicable to the equity insolvency test of section 6.40(c)(1). The treatment of preferential rights mandated
                    by this section may always be eliminated by an appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>

                    6. Time of measurement
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(e)(3) provides that the time for measuring the effect of a distribution for compliance with the insolvency and balance sheet tests for all distributions not involving the reacquisition of shares of the distribution of indebtedness is the
                    date of authorization, if the payment occurs within 120 days following the authorization; if the payment occurs more than 120 days after the authorization, however, the date of payment must be used. If the corporation elects to make
                    a distribution in the form of its own indebtedness under section 6.40(e)(2), the validity of that distribution must be measured as of the time of distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(e)(1) provides a different rule for the time of measurement when the distribution involves a reacquisition of shares. See part 8a. below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Record date
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(b) fixes the record date (if the board of directors does not otherwise fix it) for distributions other than those involving a repurchase or reacquisition of shares as the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution. No record
                    date is necessary for a repurchase or reacquisition of shares from one or more specific shareholders. The board of directors has discretion to set a record date for a repurchase or reacquisition if it is to be pro rata and to be offered
                    to all shareholders as of a specified date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8. Application to repurchases or redemption of shares
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application of the equity insolvency and balance sheet tests to distributions that involve the purchase or redemption of shares creates unique problems; section 6.40 provides specific rules for the resolution of these problems as described below.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(e)(1) provides that the time for measuring the effect of a distribution under section 6.40(c), if shares of the corporation are reacquired, is the earlier of (i) the payment date, or (ii) the date the shareholder ceased to be a shareholder
                    with respect to the shares.

       b. When tests are applied to redemption-related debt
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an acquisition of its shares, a corporation may transfer property or incur debt to the former holder of the shares. The case law on the status of this debt is conflicting. However, share repurchase agreements involving payment for shares over a period
                    of time are of special importance in closely held corporate enterprises. Section 6.40(e) provides a clear rule for this situation: the legality of the distribution must be measured at the time of the issuance or incurrence of the debt,
                    not at a later date when the debt is actually paid. Of course, this does not preclude a later challenge of a payment on account of redemption-related debt by a bankruptcy trustee on the ground that it constitutes a preferential payment
                    to a creditor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 6.40(f) provides that indebtedness created to purchase shares or issued as a distribution is on a parity with the indebtedness of the corporation to its general, unsecured creditors, except to the extent subordinated by agreement. General creditors
                    are better off in these situations than they would have been if cash or other property had been paid out for the shares or distributed (which is proper under the statute), and no worse off than if cash had been paid out to the shareholders,
                    which was then lent back to the corporation, making the shareholders creditors. The parity created by section 6.40(f) therefore is logically consistent with the rule established by section 6.40(e) that these transactions should be
                    judged at the time of the issuance of the debt.

                <p>
                    This section introduces significant changes from prior law in the criteria used to determine a corporation’s legal capacity to pay dividends and reacquire its shares. The former surplus tests no longer apply. In addition, the provisions of former G.S.
                    55-52, which limited the circumstances under which a corporation could reacquire its shares, were not brought forward. All distributions to shareholders, whether by dividends or repurchases of shares, are determined by that distribution’s
                    impact on the corporation’s solvency and the relationship between its assets and liabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (d) to make it clear that for purposes of determining asset values under the equity insolvency and balance sheet tests of subsection (c), the board of directors may use either book values or a current valuation
                    if it is reasonable under the circumstances. For purposes of determining liabilities and assets that are not revalued, the board of directors may rely on financial statements prepared in accordance with reasonable accounting practices
                    and principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (f) to clarify that a corporation may agree to secure its indebtedness to a shareholder by granting a deed of trust or other security interest. The shareholder may also agree to subordinate the indebtedness, in
                    whole or in part, to the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. Absent an agreement either to secure or to subordinate a corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder, such indebtedness will be at parity with
                    the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (g) was added to the Model Act’s provisions to address the question of how to treat a liability that by its own terms cannot be paid if its payment would violate this section. This change required the cross-reference added to subsection (e).

                        Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert claims (1) that the joinder agreements executed by two defendants were fraudulent transfers in violation of G.S. 39-23.1 and unlawful distributions in violation of G.S. 55-8-33 and G.S. 55-6-40, for which all defendants
                        were liable, or alternatively, (2) for unauthorized execution, because such claims could have been brought by any of the corporation’s creditors who, like plaintiffs, were denied timely payment of the corporation’s debts when execution
                        of the joinder agreements led to its insolvency. Angell v. Kelly, 336 F. Supp. 2d 540, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19003 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        There is no case law in North Carolina delineating who has standing to sue a shareholder under G.S. 55-6-40; however, dividends are transfers of corporate property. Since the statute declares such distributions to be “invalid,” it would appear that the
                        bankruptcy trustee would have standing to sue, under two alternate grounds: (1) as an effort to recover property under 11 U.S.C.S. § 541, if the transfer is legally void, or (2) if it had legal effect, as a transfer avoidance under
                        11 U.S.C.S. § 544. Mitchell v. Greenberg, 2003 Bankr. LEXIS 2468 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. May 27, 2003).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.01(a) requires every corporation to hold an annual meeting each year of shareholders entitled to participate in the election of directors and to consider other matters coming before the meeting of shareholders. In most instances, the meeting
                    will involve only the holders of a single class of voting shares. The principal action to be taken at the annual meeting is the election of directors pursuant to section 8.03, but the purposes of an annual meeting are not limited and
                    all matters appropriate for shareholder action may also be considered at that meeting. An annual meeting is also the appropriate forum for a shareholder to raise any relevant question about the corporation’s operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The requirement of section 7.01(a) that an annual meeting be held is phrased in mandatory terms to ensure that every shareholder entitled to participate in the meeting has the unqualified rights (1) to demand that the annual meeting be held and (2) to
                    compel the holding of the meeting under section 7.03 if the corporation does not promptly hold the meeting. Many corporations, such as non-public subsidiaries and closely held corporations, do not regularly hold annual meetings, and
                    if no shareholder objects, that practice creates no problem under section 7.01, since section 7.01(c) provides that failure to hold an annual meeting does not affect the validity of any corporate action. Rather than holding an annual
                    meeting, the shareholders may elect directors and take other appropriate action by unanimous written consent under section 7.04. And, even if the shareholders fail to elect directors, the directors currently in office continue in office
                    under section 8.05 beyond the expiration of their terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The time and place of the annual meeting may be “stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws.” If the bylaws do not themselves fix a time and place for the annual meeting, authority to fix them may be delegated to the board of directors or to a specified
                    corporate officer. This section thus gives corporations the flexibility to hold annual meetings in varying places at varying times as convenience may dictate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The annual meeting may be held either inside or outside the state or in a foreign country, but if the bylaws do not fix, or state the method of fixing, the place of the meeting, the meeting must be held at the “principal office” of the corporation. The
                    principal office is defined in section 1.40 as the location of the principal executive office of the corporation and may or may not be its registered or official office under section 5.01. Section 16.22 requires that the address of
                    the principal office be specified in the corporation’s annual report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the annual meeting is not held either within 6 months of the close of the corporation’s fiscal year or within 15 months of the last annual meeting, a shareholder may compel an annual meeting to be held under section 7.03. In the absence of a demand
                    for a meeting, a corporation can operate indefinitely without actually holding an annual meeting. The shareholders may act by unanimous consent under section 7.04, and in any event directors, once duly elected, remain in office until
                    their successors are qualified. See section 8.05.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Authority granted to the board of directors or some individual to fix the time and place of the annual meeting must be exercised in good faith. See

                        Any meeting other than an annual meeting is a special meeting under section 7.02. The principal formal differences between an annual and a special meeting are that at an annual meeting directors are elected and, subject to the special notice requirements
                        of section 7.05(b), any relevant issue pertaining to the corporation may be considered, while a special meeting must be called for specific purposes and may only consider matters within those purposes.

                <p>
                    A special meeting may be called under section 7.02(a) by the board of directors or the person or persons authorized to do so by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Typically, the person or persons holding certain designated offices within the corporation,
                    e.g., the president, chairman of the board of directors, or chief executive officer, are given authority to call special meetings of the shareholders. In addition, the holders of at least 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast
                    on a proposed issue at the special meeting may require the corporation to hold a special meeting by signing, dating, and delivering one or more writings that demand a special meeting and set forth the purpose or purposes of the desired
                    meeting. Shareholders demanding a special meeting do not have to sign a single piece of paper, but the writings signed must all describe essentially the same purpose or purposes. Upon receipt of writings evidencing a demand by holders
                    of 10 percent of the votes, the corporation (through an appropriate officer) must call the special meeting at a reasonable time and place. The shareholders’ demand may suggest a time and place but the final decision on such matters
                    is the corporation’s. If no meeting is held within the time periods specified in section 7.03, the shareholders may obtain a summary court order under that section requiring that the meeting be held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.02(b) fixes a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to sign a demand for a special shareholders’ meeting. Unless a record date is otherwise fixed for this purpose, the record date is the date the first shareholder signs the demand.
                    If a shareholder initially signs a demand but later seeks to withdraw his demand, the corporation may permit the shareholder to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 7.02(a)(2) it is possible that more than one faction of shareholders may demand meetings at roughly the same time or that a single (or changing) faction of shareholders may request consecutive, overlapping, or repetitive meetings. The responsible
                    corporate officers have some discretion as to the call and purposes of a meeting, and where demands are repetitious or overlapping, they may refuse to call a meeting for a purpose identical or similar to a purpose for which a previous
                    special meeting was held in the recent past. Similarly, they may decline to call a special meeting when an annual meeting will be held in the near future. This limited discretion of the corporation to deny repetitive or overlapping
                    demands may ultimately be tested under section 7.03, which itself gives the court discretion whether or not to compel the holding of a special meeting under these circumstances. See the Official Comment to section 7.03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.05(c) provides that a notice of a special meeting must include a “description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.” Section 7.02(d) states that only business that is within that purpose or those purposes may be conducted
                    at the special meeting. The word “within” was chosen, rather than a broader phrase like “reasonably related to,” to describe the relationship between the notice and the authorized business to assure a shareholder who does not attend
                    a special meeting that new or unexpected matters will not be considered in his absence.

                    The provision following the semicolon in subdivision (a)(2) was added to the Model Act’s provisions to bring forward former G.S. 55-61(c), modified to change the threshold test from companies listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
                    by more than 2000 shareholders to all public corporations (as defined in G.S. 55-1-40(18a)). This modification was designed to provide a clearer, “bright line” test, which has been employed throughout this Act.

                    Section 7.03 provides the remedy for shareholders if the corporation refuses or fails to hold a shareholders’ meeting as required by section 7.01 or 7.02. A shareholder entitled to participate in a meeting may apply for a summary court order to command
                    the holding of a meeting if (1) an annual meeting is not held within 6 months after the end of the corporation’s fiscal year or 15 months after its last annual meeting, or (2) a special meeting is not properly noticed within 30 days
                    after a valid demand is delivered to the secretary of the corporation or, if properly noticed, is not held in accordance with the notice. Since a meeting must be held within 60 days of the notice date under section 7.05, the maximum
                    delay between the demand for a special meeting and the right to petition a court for a summary order is 90 days.

                    The identity of the specific court with jurisdiction to order a shareholder’s meeting under section 7.03(a) must be supplied by each state when enacting this section. It is intended that this should be a court of general civil jurisdiction. Generally,
                    all matters relating to a corporation should be addressed to the court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located in the state or, if the corporation does not have a principal office in the state, to the court
                    in the county in which its registered office is located.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The court has discretion under section 7.03 since the language of the statute is that the court “may summarily order” that a meeting be held. A court, for example, may refuse to order a special meeting if the specified purpose is repetitive of the purpose
                    of a special meeting held in the recent past. See the Official Comment to section 7.02. Alternatively, the court may view the demand as a good faith request for reconsideration of an action taken in the recent past and may order a
                    meeting to be held. Similarly, even though a demand for an annual meeting is not a formal prerequisite for an application for a summary order under this section, the court may withhold setting a time and date for the annual meeting
                    for a reasonably short period in order to permit the corporation to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any event, a shareholder applying for a summary order to hold a meeting has the burden of showing that he is entitled to the order. In the case of a special meeting, he has the burden of showing that the demand was executed by the holders of at least
                    10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast on the record date and that the demand was duly delivered to the corporation’s secretary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the court orders that a meeting be held, it may fix the time and place of the meeting, determine the voting groups entitled to participate in the meeting, set the record date, order notice to be given as required by section 7.05, and enter such other
                    orders as may be appropriate for the holding of the meeting. The court may also establish the quorum requirements for specific matters to be considered at the meeting or direct that the votes represented at the meeting automatically
                    constitute a quorum for the taking of any action without regard to section 7.25 or any provision to the contrary in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws. The latter alternative prevents a holder of the majority of
                    the votes (who may not desire that a meeting be held) from frustrating the court-ordered meeting by not attending to prevent the existence of a quorum. In order to prevent misunderstanding about a special quorum requirement, if one
                    is imposed, it is appropriate for the court to order that the notice of the meeting state specifically and conspicuously that a special quorum requirement is applicable to the court-ordered meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The court may provide that a meeting it has ordered is to be the annual meeting. If so provided, the meeting should be viewed as compliance with section 7.01, precluding all other shareholder requests for an annual meeting for that year.

                    The language of the Model Act in the introductory clause of subsection (a) was modified to clarify that notice must be given to a corporation before a shareholders’ meeting can be summarily ordered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subdivision (a)(1) to allow any shareholder, not just those entitled to participate in the meeting, to apply for a court-ordered annual meeting of shareholders if the meeting is not held within 15 months after the corporation’s
                    last annual meeting. The change reflects the principle that all shareholders have an interest in the corporation’s holding shareholders’ meetings. In addition, the Model Act permits a shareholder to petition for a court-ordered meeting
                    if no annual meeting is held within the earlier of six months after the close of the corporation’s fiscal year or 15 months after the last annual meeting. The drafters concluded that the six months’ limitation was undesirably restrictive
                    and effectively mandated meetings during a particular part of the year. This provision was therefore omitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subdivision (a)(2) to clarify that a demand must actually be received by the corporation’s secretary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to allow reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to be awarded to an applying shareholder in the discretion of the court.

                    Section 7.04 provides that all the shareholders entitled to vote on an issue may validly act by unanimous written consent without a meeting. Unanimous written consent is obtainable, as a practical matter, only on matters on which there are only a relatively
                    few shareholders entitled to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.04 is based on the fundamental premise that if all the voting shareholders desire some action to be taken, no purpose is served by requiring the formality of holding a meeting of shareholders. Action by unanimous written consent has the same
                    effect as a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document, including documents delivered to the secretary of state for filing. Section 7.04 is applicable to any shareholder action, including, without limitation, election
                    of directors, approval of mergers or sales of substantially all the corporate property not in the ordinary course of business, amendments of articles of incorporation, and dissolution.

                    To be effective, consents must be in writing, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote, and delivered to the secretary of the corporation. The phrase “one or more written consents” is included in section 7.04(a) to make it clear that all shareholders
                    do not need to sign the same piece of paper. The record date for determining who is entitled to vote, if not otherwise fixed by or in accordance with the bylaws, is the date the first shareholder signs the consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Action by unanimous written consent is effective only when the last shareholder has signed the appropriate written consent and all consents have been delivered to the secretary of the corporation. Before that time, any shareholder may withdraw his consent
                    simply by advising the secretary of that fact. Cf.
                    <i>
       Calumet Industries, Inc. v. McClure,
      </i> 464 F. Supp. 19 (N.D. Ill. 1978). The withdrawal of a single consent, of course, destroys the unanimous written consent required by this section. If a shareholder seeks to withdraw his consent after all shareholders have
                    signed written consents and filed them with the secretary of the corporation, the corporation may treat the attempted withdrawal as too late or give it effect, thereby requiring the matter to be presented at a shareholders’ meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.04 is applicable to all shareholder actions, including the approval of fundamental corporate changes described in chapters 10, 11, 12, and 14. If these actions were taken at an annual or special meeting, shareholders who were not entitled to
                    vote on the matter would nevertheless be entitled to receive notice of the meeting, including a description of the transaction proposed to be considered at the meeting. See, e.g., sections 10.03 (notice of proposed amendment), 11.03
                    (notice of proposed merger). In order to ensure that nonvoting shareholders have essentially the same right if action is taken by consent rather than at a meeting, section 7.04(d) provides that all nonvoting shareholders must be given
                    at least 10 days’ written notice of the fundamental corporate changes that are proposed for approval by consent.

                    Effective January 1, 2002, this section was amended to permit less than unanimous shareholder action without meeting for corporations other than public corporations. Subsection (b) was amended to add a requirement that written consents to an action must
                    be obtained from shareholders within a period of 60 days. Subsection (d) was amended to require advance notice of proposed shareholder action on certain fundamental corporate changes to all shareholders (other than shareholders who
                    consent to the action) rather than only to holders of nonvoting shares. Advance notice is not required if the articles of incorporation so provided. Subsection (e) was added to provide that if action is taken by less than unanimous
                    written consent, notice of the action must be given within 10 days after the action is taken to all shareholders who have not consented to the action and who would have been entitled to notice of the proposed action if the action had
                    been taken at a meeting.

                    Generally, only shareholders who are entitled to vote at a meeting are entitled to notice. Thus, notice usually needs to be sent only to holders of shares entitled to vote for an election of directors or generally on other matters (in the case of an annual
                    meeting), and on matters within the specified purposes set forth in the notice (in the case of a special meeting), and only to holders of shares of those classes or series of shares on the record date. The last sentence of section
                    7.05(a), however, recognizes that other sections of the Act require that notice of meetings at which certain types of fundamental corporate changes are to be considered must be sent to all shareholders, including holders of shares
                    who are not entitled to vote on any matter at the meeting. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In addition, the articles of incorporation may require that notice of meetings be given to all or specified voting groups of shareholders
                    who are not entitled to vote on the matters considered at those meetings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice of all special meetings must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the matters acted upon at the meeting are limited to those within the notice of meeting. By contrast, the notice of an annual meeting
                    usually need not refer to any specific purpose or purposes, and any matter appropriate for shareholder action may be considered. As recognized in subsection (b), however, other provisions of the revised Model Act provide that certain
                    types of fundamental corporate changes may be considered at an annual meeting only if specific reference to the proposed action appears in the notice of meeting. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In addition, if the board
                    of directors chooses, a notice of an annual meeting may contain references to purposes or proposals not required by statute. In either event, if a notice of an annual meeting refers specifically to one or more purposes, the meeting
                    is not limited to those purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.05(d) is a catch-all record date provision for both annual and special meetings. If the record date for notice and for voting entitlement is not otherwise fixed pursuant to sections 7.03 or 7.07, the record date for purposes of determining who
                    is entitled to notice and to vote at the meeting is the close of business on the day before the notice is mailed to the voting groups of shareholders. If notice is mailed to shareholders over a period of more than one day, the day
                    before the notice is delivered to the first shareholders is the record date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The selection of the close of business on the day before the notice is mailed as the catch-all record date is intended to permit the corporation to mail notices to shareholders on a given day without regard to any requests for transfer that may have been
                    received during that day. For this reason, this section is not inconsistent with the general principle set forth in the last sentence of section 7.07(a) that the board of directors may not fix a retroactive record date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.05(e) provides rules for adjourned meetings and determines whether new notice must be given to shareholders. Under this subsection a meeting may be adjourned to a different date, time, or place without additional notice to the shareholders (unless
                    the bylaws require otherwise) if the new date, time, or place is announced before adjournment. But new notice is required if a new record date is or must be fixed under section 7.07(c). If a new record date is or must be fixed, the
                    10-to-60-day notice requirement and all other requirements of section 7.05 must be complied with as notice is given to the persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. A new quorum for the adjourned meeting must also be
                    established. See section 7.25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.25 provides that if a quorum exists for a meeting, it is deemed to continue to exist automatically for an adjourned meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.

                    A notice of shareholder meetings serves two principal purposes: (1) it advises shareholders of the date, time, and place of the annual or special meeting, and (2) in the case of a special meeting (or an annual meeting at which fundamental changes may
                    be made), it advises shareholders of the purposes of the meeting. If a shareholder attends a meeting, he has probably received some form of notice of the date, time, and place of the meeting whether from the corporation or from another
                    source. As a result, section 7.06(b)(1) provides that attendance at a meeting constitutes waiver of any failure to receive the notice or defects in the statement of the date, time, and place of any meeting. Defects waived by attendance
                    for this purpose include a failure to send the notice altogether, delivery to the wrong address, a misstatement of the date, time, or place of the meeting, and a failure to notice the meeting within the time periods specified in section
                    7.05(a). If a shareholder believes that the defect in or failure of notice was in some way prejudicial, he may preserve his objection by stating at the beginning of the meeting that he objects to holding the meeting or transacting
                    any business. If this objection is made, the corporation may correct the defect by sending proper notice to the shareholders for a subsequent meeting or by obtaining written waivers of notice from all shareholders who did not receive
                    the notice required by section 7.05.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For purposes of this section, “attendance” at a meeting involves the presence of the shareholder in person or by proxy. A shareholder who attends a meeting solely for the purpose of objecting to the notice may be counted as present for purposes of determining
                    whether a quorum is present. See the Official Comment to section 7.25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of special meetings, or annual meetings at which fundamental corporate changes are considered, a second purpose of the notice is to tell shareholders what is to be considered at the meeting. An objection that a particular matter is not within
                    the stated purposes of the meeting obviously cannot be raised until the matter is presented. Thus section 7.06(b)(2) provides that a shareholder waives this kind of objection if he fails to object promptly after the matter is first
                    presented. If this objection is made, the corporation may correct the defect by sending proper notice to the shareholders for a subsequent meeting or obtaining written waivers of notice from all shareholders. Of course, whether or
                    not a specific matter is within a stated purpose of a meeting is ultimately a matter for judicial determination, typically in a suit to invalidate action taken at the meeting brought by a shareholder who was not present at the meeting
                    or who was present at the meeting and preserved his objection under section 7.06(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of both waiver rules in section 7.06(b) is to require shareholders with technical objections to holding the meeting or considering a specific matter to raise them at the outset and not reserve them to be raised only if they are unhappy with
                    the outcome of the meeting. The rules set forth in this section differ in some respects from the waiver rules for directors set forth in section 8.23 where a waiver is inferred if the director acquiesces in the action taken at a meeting
                    even if he raised a technical objection to the notice of a meeting at the outset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other sections of the Model Act require that shareholders who are not entitled to vote are entitled to notice of meetings at which certain fundamental corporate changes are to be considered. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In order to obtain
                    an effective waiver of notice for these meetings under this section, waivers must be obtained from the nonvoting shareholders who are entitled to notice as well as from the voting shareholders.

                    Section 7.07 authorizes the board of directors to fix record dates for any action unless the bylaws themselves fix or provide for the fixing of a record date. A separate record date may be established for each voting group entitled to vote separately
                    on a matter at a meeting, or a single record date may be established for all voting groups entitled to participate in the meeting. If neither the bylaws nor the board of directors fix a record date for a specific action, the section
                    of this Act that deals with that action itself fixes the record date. For example, section 7.05(d), relating to giving notice of a meeting, provides that the record date for determining who is entitled to notice of a meeting (if not
                    fixed by the directors or the bylaws) is the close of business on the day before the date the corporation first gives notice to shareholders of the meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A record date may not be fixed more than 70 days before the meeting or action in question and may not be fixed retroactively. Once set, the same record date may be utilized for an adjournment of the meeting that reconvenes within 120 days after the date
                    fixed for the original meeting or the board of directors may fix a new record date. If the adjourned meeting takes place more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, section 7.07(c) requires that a new record date
                    be fixed. But if an adjournment is ordered by a court, section 7.07(d) allows the court to provide that the original record date continues to be applicable or to fix a different date. In any event, if a different record date is or
                    must be fixed under this section, section 7.05 requires that new notice be given to the persons who are shareholders as of the new record date, and section 7.25 requires that a quorum be reestablished for that meeting.

                        Section 7.09 permits shareholders to participate in annual and special shareholder meetings by means of remote communication, such as over the Internet or through telephone conference calls, subject to the conditions set forth in section 7.09(b) and any
                        other guidelines and procedures that the board of directors adopts. This would include the use of electronic ballots to the extent authorized by the board of directors. This authorization extends as well to anyone to whom such
                        shareholder has granted a proxy. Section 7.09 does not eliminate the requirement that corporations hold meetings at a physical location. See sections 7.01 and 7.02. Section 7.09 expressly provides that participation by remote means
                        is permitted only if it is authorized by the board of directors. This limitation is meant to ensure that the board of directors has the sole discretion to determine whether to allow shareholders to participate by means of remote
                        communication. Thus, a corporation may not be compelled to allow such participation either through amendments to the bylaws, shareholder resolutions, or otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.09 allows the board of director s to limit participation by means of remote communication to all share holders of a particular class or series, but does not permit the board of directors to limit such participation to particular shareholders
                        within a class or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.09 requires the board of directors to implement certain procedures when allowing shareholder participation by means of remote communication. First, the board of directors must create reasonable measures for verifying those entitled to vote.
                        Second, the board of directors must institute reasonable measures to ensure that all shareholders and their proxies within the authorized class or series have the opportunity to participate in the meeting, including measures that
                        provide them with an opportunity to communicate with management and other shareholders present at the meeting, and to read or hear the proceedings. While this provision is aimed at approximating as much as possible shareholder
                        participation in person or by proxy, including interacting with management during the meeting, it does not require that all can so participate and interact. In addition, Section 7.09 is not intended to expand the rights to participate
                        in meetings or otherwise alter the ability of the board of directors or the chair to conduct meetings pursuant to section 7.08 in a manner that is fair and orderly. For example, many corporations limit or cut-off shareholder comments
                        and, if such practice is fair to shareholders consistent with section 7.08, such practice is not changed by section 7.09. The two requirements under section 7.09(b) reflect the minimum deemed necessary to safeguard the integrity
                        of the shareholders’ meeting. Section 7.09 specifically gives the board of directors the flexibility and discretion to adopt additional guidelines and procedures for allowing shareholders to participate in a meeting by means of
                        remote communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to give corporations the flexibility to choose the most efficient means of remote communication, the board may require that shareholders communicate their desire to participate by a certain date and condition the provision of remote communication
                        or the form of communication to be used on the affirmative response of a certain number or proportion of shareholders eligible to participate. If the board of directors authorizes shareholder participation by means of remote communication
                        pursuant to this section, such authorization and the process for participating by remote means of communication, must be included in the meeting notice required by section 7.05.

                    Section 7.20 requires the preparation of a list of shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting and requires that this list be made available on request to shareholders within two business days after the meeting notice is given.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of shareholders is often referred to as the “voting list” and usually the list will include only the names of those shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. The list, however, must also include the names and shareholdings of shareholders
                    of nonvoting shares if they are entitled to notice of the meeting by reason of the nature of the actions proposed to be taken at the meeting. See section 7.05 and its Official Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making the list of shareholders available before the meeting marks a change from the 1969 version of the Model Act. Through this device, a shareholder may learn the identity of the owners of substantial blocks of shares or the owners of shares similarly
                    situated and communicate with them to see if his concerns are shared and should be pursued.

                <p>
                    The list must generally be available for inspection two business days after notice of the meeting is given and continuously thereafter until the meeting occurs. If, however, notice of the meeting is waived by all the shareholders, the list need be available
                    only at the meeting itself under section 7.20(c) unless one or more waivers are conditioned upon receipt of the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20(b) permits the list to be maintained either at the corporation’s principal office or at another location in the city in which the meeting is to be held, the precise location to be designated in the notice of meeting. If the corporation changes
                    the location of its annual meeting, it thus may correspondingly change the location of the list of shareholders pursuant to this subsection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20(c) also requires a copy of the shareholders’ list to be available at the meeting itself for inspection. This list may be used to determine attendance, the presence or absence of a quorum, and the right to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20 does not require the list of shareholders to be in any particular form. It may be maintained, for example, in electronic form. If the list is maintained in other than written form, however, suitable equipment must be provided so that a comprehensible
                    list may be inspected by a shareholder as permitted by this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20 creates a corporate obligation rather than an obligation imposed upon a corporate officer. If the corporation fails to prepare the list or refuses to permit a shareholder to inspect it, either before the meeting as required by section 7.20(b)
                    or at the meeting itself as required by section 7.20(c), a shareholder may apply to the appropriate court under section 7.20(d) for a summary order permitting inspection of the list; the court may further order the meeting to be postponed
                    for a reasonable time. If the court orders a copy of the list to be provided to the shareholders, the copying is at the corporation’s expense; if the corporation produces the list voluntarily pursuant to section 7.20(b) or (c), any
                    inspection and copying are at the shareholder’s expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This judicial remedy is the only sanction for violation of section 7.20 since section 7.20(e) provides that the failure to prepare, maintain, or produce the list does not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20(b) permits shareholders to “inspect” the list without limitation, but permits the shareholder to “copy” the list only if the shareholder complies with the requirement of section 16.02(c), that the demand be “made in good faith and for a proper
                    purpose.” The right to copy the list includes, if reasonable, the right to receive a copy of the list upon payment of a reasonable charge. See sections 16.03(b) and (c). The distinction between “inspection” and “copying” set forth
                    in section 7.20(b) reflects an accommodation between competing considerations of permitting shareholders access to the list before a meeting and possible misuse of the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.20 creates a right of shareholders to inspect a list of shareholders in advance of and at a meeting that is independent of the rights of shareholders to inspect corporate records under chapter 16A. A shareholder may obtain the right to inspect
                    the list of shareholders as provided in chapter 16A without regard to the provisions relating to the pendency of a meeting in section 7.20, and similarly the limitations of chapter 16A are not applicable to the right of inspection
                    created by section 7.20 except to the extent the shareholder seeks to copy the list in advance of the meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to inspect under chapter 16A is also broader in the sense that in some circumstances the shareholder may be entitled to receive copies of the documents he may inspect. See section 16.03.

                    Section 7.21(a) provides that each outstanding share, regardless of class or series, is entitled to one vote per share unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation may provide for multiple or fractional votes
                    per share and may provide that some classes or series of shares are nonvoting on some or all matters, or that some classes or series have a single vote per share or different multiple or fractional votes per share, or that some classes
                    or series constitute one or more separate voting groups and are entitled to vote separately on the matter. To reflect the possibility that shares may have multiple or fractional votes per share, the provisions relating to quorums,
                    voting, and similar matters in the Act are phrased in terms of votes represented by shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the last sentence of section 7.21(a), the power to vote may only be vested in shares. For example, bondholders may not be given the direct power to vote under the Act. They may, however, be given the power to vote by issuing them special classes
                    or series of shares. See the Official Comment to section 7.22.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the prohibition in section 7.21(b) is to prevent a board of directors or management from using a corporate investment to perpetuate itself in power. While shares acquired by a corporation cease to be outstanding under section 6.31, except
                    as provided in that section, and therefore are not entitled to vote, other arrangements may be devised seeking to obtain the benefits of ownership without actually acquiring the shares at all or not acquiring the shares at the time
                    the right to vote is determined. The concept of shares that “otherwise belong to” is included in addition to “owned by” to ensure that courts will have the flexibility to apply public policy considerations to arrangements under which
                    shares are not technically “owned,” or under which shares may or will be owned at a later time, but which have a similar effect. For example, if the corporation or a controlled entity has entered into a forward purchase contract for
                    shares with the right to vote or direct the vote of the shares, a court could find that the shares belong to the corporation and are not entitled to be voted under section 7.21. Similarly, if the voting power is exercised by someone
                    acting on behalf of the corporation or by a member of management of the corporation, a court could find that the shares otherwise belong to the corporation, and are not entitled to vote under section 7.21. Section 7.21(c), however,
                    makes the prohibition of section 7.21(b) against voting of shares inapplicable to shares held in a fiduciary capacity where the beneficiaries are persons other than the corporation directly or through an entity controlled by the corporation.

                    Redeemable shares are often redeemed in connection with a transaction such as a merger or the issuance of a new senior class or series of shares that requires shareholder approval. Section 7.21(d) avoids subjecting a transaction to approval by a class
                    or series of redeemable shares that will be redeemed as a result of the transaction if adequate provision has been made to ensure that the holders of the redeemable shares will in fact receive the amount payable to them on redemption.

                    Section 7.22 provides that shareholders may vote in person or by proxy and establishes the basic rules for appointing a proxy. As business organizations have increased in size and complexity, the number of shareholders has also increased. As a result,
                    proxy voting is an essential step in the governance of many corporations.

                    The word “proxy” is often used ambiguously, sometimes referring to the grant of authority to vote, sometimes to the document granting the authority, and sometimes to the person to whom the authority is granted. In the revised Model Act the word “proxy”
                    is used only in the last sense; the term “appointment form” is used to describe the document appointing the proxy; and the word “appointment” is used to describe the grant of authority to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote for him simply by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his attorney-in-fact. The appointment is effective when it is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to receive and
                    tabulate votes. The proxy has the same power to vote as that possessed by the shareholder, unless the appointment form contains an express limitation on the power to vote or direction as to how to vote the shares on a particular matter,
                    in which event the corporation must tabulate the votes in a manner consistent with that limitation or direction. See section 7.22(h).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An appointment form that contains no expiration date is valid for 11 months. See section 7.22(c). This ensures that in the normal course a new appointment will be solicited at least once every 12 months. But an appointment form may validly specify a longer
                    period if the parties agree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The appointment of a proxy is essentially the appointment of an agent and is revocable in accordance with the principles of agency law unless it is “coupled with an interest.” See section 7.22(d). Thus, an appointment may be revoked either expressly or
                    by implication, as when a shareholder later executes a second appointment form inconsistent with an earlier one, or attends the meeting in person and seeks to vote on his own behalf. The revised Model Act does not attempt to codify
                    these common law principles of agency law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While death or incapacity of the appointing shareholder revokes an agency appointment under common law principles, section 7.22(e) modifies the common law rule to provide that the corporation may accept the vote of the proxy until the appropriate corporate
                    officer or agent receives notice of the shareholder’s death or incapacity. In view of the widespread dispersal of shareholders in many corporations, it is not feasible for the corporation to learn of these events independently of notice.
                    On the other hand, section 7.22(e) does not affect the validity of the proxy appointment or its manner of exercise as between the proxy and the personal representatives of the decedent or incompetent. That relationship is governed
                    by the law of agency independent of the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.22(d) deals with the irrevocable appointment of a proxy. The general test adopted is the common law test that all appointments are revocable unless “coupled with an interest.” But section 7.22(d) provides considerable certainty since it describes
                    several accepted forms of relationship as examples of “proxies coupled with an interest.” These examples are not exhaustive and other arrangements may also be held to be “coupled with an interest.” See Comment, “The Irrevocable Proxy
                    and Voting Control of Small Business Corporations,” 98 U. PA. L. REV. 401, 405-7 (1950); see generally I RESTATEMENT OF AGENCY (SECOND) § 138 (1958).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.22(f) provides that an irrevocable proxy is revoked when the interest with which it was coupled is extinguished — for example, by repayment of the loan or release of the pledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A transferee for value of shares that are subject to an irrevocable appointment takes free of the appointment if (1) he did not know of the existence of the appointment and (2) the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on
                    the certificate or information statement. See section 7.22(g). Under this subsection, both the appointment and the irrevocable nature of the appointment must conspicuously appear on the certificate.

                    The second sentence of subsection (b), which was contained in substance in former G.S. 55-68, was added to the Model Act’s provisions to broaden the permissible forms of proxies. The use of a variety of methods of modern communication to transmit a proxy
                    is especially useful for public corporations.

                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in the second sentence of subsection (c) by changing “longer” to “different” to permit proxy appointments for less than 11 months.

                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (f) to provide that an irrevocable proxy appointment is revocable (but not automatically revoked) when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. The drafters concluded that the automatic revocation
                    in the Model Act could create reliance problems for third parties.

                    Former G.S. 55-68(b) provided that no proxy was valid for more than 10 years from the date of its execution unless it was renewed or extended for an additional period of not more than 10 years. This limitation was not brought forward.

                <p>
                    Traditionally, a corporation recognizes only the registered owner as the owner of shares. Indeed, section 1.40 defines “shareholder” basically as the registered owner of shares. But it has become a common practice for persons purchasing shares to have
                    them registered in the “street name” of a broker-dealer or other financial institution, principally to facilitate transfer by eliminating the need for the beneficial owner’s signature and delivery. In addition, in order to avoid the
                    burdens of processing securities transfers, which caused a crisis in the securities industry in the late 1960s, a system of securities depositories (defined as “clearing corporations” in section 8-102(3) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE)
                    has been developed. In this system, financial institutions deposit securities with the depository, which becomes the registered owner of the shares. Transfers between depositories are then accomplished by book entry of the depository.
                    As a result, there may be two entities interposed between the corporation and the beneficial owner with the depository being the registered owner for the account of the brokerage firm that in turn holds the shares for the account of
                    the beneficial owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of section 7.23 is to facilitate direct communication between the corporation and the beneficial owner by authorizing the corporation to create a procedure for bypassing both the registered owner and intermediate brokerage firms. The adoption
                    of this procedure is discretionary with each corporation and affirmative action by the corporation is necessary to accomplish it. The procedure is also discretionary with the shareholder, who must elect to follow the applicable procedure
                    prescribed by the corporation. The shareholder retains all of his rights except those granted to the beneficial owner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The corporation may limit or qualify the procedure as it deems appropriate. For example, the corporation may:

                <p>
                    Corporations are often asked to accept written instrument as evidence of action by a shareholder. These instruments usually involve appointment forms for a proxy to vote the shares, but may also include waivers of notice, consents to action without a
                    meeting, requests for a special meeting of shareholders, and similar instruments involving action by the shareholders. Usually the corporation or its officers will have no personal knowledge of the circumstances under which the instrument
                    was executed and no way of verifying whether the signature on the instrument is in fact the signature of the shareholder. This problem is particularly acute in large corporations with thousands of shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.24 establishes general rules permitting the corporation and its officers or agents to accept these instruments if they appear to be executed by the shareholder or by a person who has authority to execute the instrument for the shareholder and
                    they are accompanied by whatever authenticating evidence the corporation reasonably requests. The rules set forth in this section are not exclusive and may be supplemented by additional rules established by the corporation pursuant
                    to section 2.06(b). Section 7.24(a) authorizes acceptance of an instrument if the name appearing on the instrument “corresponds” to the name of the shareholder, while section 7.24(b) permits the acceptance of an instrument executed
                    by a person other than the shareholder if there is a designation or evidence of the capacity of the person executing the instrument that indicates the act of the person is the act of the shareholder. On the other hand, section 7.24(c)
                    permits rejection of an instrument if the officer or agent tabulating votes has a “reasonable basis for doubt” about the validity of the signature or about the authority of the person acting on behalf of the shareholder. These principles
                    are described in greater detail below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of section 7.24 is to protect the corporation and its officers or agents from liability for damages to the shareholder if action is taken in accordance with the section. Thus section 7.24(d) provides that there is no liability to the shareholder
                    if the corporation’s officer or agent, acting in good faith, accepts an instrument that meets the requirements of section 7.24(a) or (b), even if it turns out that the execution was invalid or unauthorized; similarly, no liability
                    exists if the officer or agent, again acting in good faith, rejects an instrument because of a “reasonable basis for doubt,” even though it turns out that the instrument was properly executed by the shareholder. But section 7.24 does
                    not address the question whether an action was properly or improperly taken or approved, and section 7.24(e) makes clear that the validity or invalidity of corporate action is ultimately a matter for judicial resolution through review
                    of the results of an election in a suit to enjoin or compel corporate action. It is contemplated that any such suit will be brought promptly, typically before the corporate action is consummated or the corporation’s position otherwise
                    changes in reliance on the vote, and that any suit that is not brought promptly under the circumstances would normally be barred because of laches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, section 7.24 does not address the liability of the proxy to the shareholder for exercising authority beyond that granted to him or for disobeying instructions. These matters are governed by the law of agency and not by section 7.24.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The American Society of Corporate Secretaries has established principles for the acceptance of proxy appointments in routine elections in which there is no proxy contest. Many of the examples of the application of section 7.24 set forth below are based
                    on these principles.

                                if shares are registered in the name of “Peter Jones,” “Ed Smith, Agent,” “Paul Smith, Son,” “Mary Smith Jones, Wife,” “Emelia Able, Attorney,” “Arthur Peters, Private Secretary,” “Paul Jones, Trustee under Deed of Trust

                                signed by or on behalf of fewer than all the persons named. This conclusion proceeds on the assumption that the signer or signers have authority to act for the others and there is nothing on the face of the instrument that
                                rebuts this assumption.

                    c. If the shares are registered in the name “Peter Smith, Sr.” but the designation “Sr.” is omitted, e.g., “Peter Smith.” The execution “Peter Smith, Jr.,” however, does not correspond with the shareholder.

                    2. Examples of executions that “indicate the capacity” of the person signing
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all the following instances, the corporation may request additional evidence of authority but is not required to do so; officers and agents are protected from liability if they routinely accept the instrument without requiring additional evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Examples of “reasonable basis for doubt”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase “reasonable basis for doubt” about the validity of a signature or about the signer’s authority creates an objective standard for the exercise of the authority granted by section 7.24(c) to reject proffered instruments. In the absence of a proxy
                    fight or a seriously contested issue, instruments should be rejected only if there seems to be no basis for finding the execution regular on its face. In a proxy fight or other contested issue, the possibility of illegal or unauthorized
                    execution is greatly increased, and a more cautious attitude should therefore be adopted. The following are examples in which a “reasonable basis for doubt” could be found to exist:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. The shares are registered in the name of “John F. Smith” and the instrument is executed by “Joseph F. Smith” or by “Frank W. Smith.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. The shares are registered in the name of “Ellen Smith, a Minor” or “John Smith, Custodian for Ellen Smith, a Minor,” and the instrument is executed by “Ellen Smith.” There is no “reasonable basis for doubt,” however, if the instrument is accompanied
                    by evidence satisfactory to the corporation that the shareholder is no longer a minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. A proxy appointment is received that is regular on its face, and the secretary or other corporate officer or agent receives a telephone call from a person who identifies himself as the shareholder and says either that he wishes to revoke the appointment
                    or that he did not authorize its original execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    d. Shares are registered in the name of two or more persons as co-owners, the instrument is executed by fewer than all of them, and the instrument shows on its face that not all the registered owners granted authority to the signers, as where the instrument
                    states that it was not possible to obtain all the coowners’ signatures or that some refused to sign. For the normal rule of acceptability of proxies executed by fewer than all co-owners, however, see section 7.24(b)(5) and part 2.e
                    of this Official Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. The corporation receives a copy of letters of appointment of a receiver, executor, administrator or other fiduciary, and the instrument is executed in the name of the shareholder rather than by the fiduciary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Other principles applicable to proxy appointments
                </p>
                <p>
                    As indicated in the Official Comment to section 7.22, a proxy is simply an agent of the shareholder, and his appointment therefore involves primarily the law of agency. The law of agency determines the rights and duties of the shareholder and the proxy,
                    and it is important to recognize that section 7.24 is not intended to affect these rights and duties. Rather, it recognizes that the great bulk of instruments executed in the name of a shareholder or on his behalf are in fact authorized
                    and the corporation and its officers should be encouraged to accept them rather than to adopt unduly narrow requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Regardless of where the signature appears on the instrument (whether or not in the space provided), if there is no reason to doubt the intent to execute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) Whether the name is handwritten, handprinted, or rubberstamped in facsimile-signature or printed form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4) Whether there are deviations between the registered name and the signature, provided that the deviations are not inconsistent with the registered name. For example, if the shares are registered in the name of “John F. Smith,” the following are acceptable:
                    “J. Foster Smith,” “J. Smith,” “J.F. Smith,” “J.F.S.,” “J.S.,” “John F.,” and even simply “Smith.” Similarly, if “John Smith” is the name of the shareholder, “John F. Smith” and “J. Foster Smith” are also acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (5) If marked by an “X” and witnessed by one other person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (6) If not executed at all, a signed letter or telegram from the shareholder states that he has signed the instrument or approves of the action taken by the instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (7) The signature is illegible, unless it cannot reasonably be considered to be the signature of the shareholder. For example, if shares are registered in the name of “John F. Smith,” the signature is not acceptable if the first letter of the signature
                    is clearly an “M” or the first word is “Mark.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. If the shares are registered in the maiden name of a woman, e.g., Mary Smith, and the instrument is executed:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (1) In her married name, clearly indicated as such, e.g., “Mary Smith Jones (formerly Mary Smith)” or “Mary Smith (now Mrs. Mary Smith Jones).”
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) In her married name or in a form that implies her married status, e.g., “Mary Smith Anderson,” “Mrs. Mary S. Anderson,” “Mrs. Mary Smith Anderson,” or “Mrs. Mary Anderson.”

                <p>
                    c. If the shares are registered in the name “Peter Smith, Sr.” but the designation “Sr.” is omitted, e.g., “Peter Smith.” The execution “Peter Smith, Jr.,” however, does not correspond with the shareholder.

                    2. Examples of executions that “indicate the capacity” of the person signing
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all the following instances, the corporation may request additional evidence of authority but is not required to do so; officers and agents are protected from liability if they routinely accept the instrument without requiring additional evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of a partnership, e.g., “Smith Bros.,” an instrument may be accepted if executed either in the form “Smith Bros. by John Able, Partner” or simply “Smith Bros.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of a corporation, e.g., “Smith Corporation,” an instrument may be accepted if executed in the name of the corporation, by an officer or agent designated as holding a responsible position, by a person
                    with a surname similar to the corporate name, or simply in the name of the corporation, e.g., “Smith Corporation by John Able, President,” “Smith Corporation by Peter Apt, Agent,” “Smith Corporation by John Smith,” or “Smith Corporation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of an individual who is deceased, incompetent, a minor, in bankruptcy, or in receivership, an instrument may be accepted if it is executed by an executor, administrator, guardian, receiver, or trustee
                    who signs as such. Shares registered in the name of a minor may be voted by a parent of the shareholder if he is identified as such, e.g., “Ralph Able by John Able, Father.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    d. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of an individual, an instrument may be accepted if it is executed by another individual who indicates (1) that he is signing as an agent or attorney-in-fact for the shareholder (see section 7.22);
                    (2) that he has a close family or other relationship with the shareholder from which authority can be inferred; or (3) that he is the beneficial owner of shares, a pledgee of the shares, or a donee of the shares. For example: if shares
                    are registered in the name of “Peter Jones,” “Ed Smith, Agent,” “Paul Smith, Son,” “Mary Smith Jones, Wife,” “Emelia Able, Attorney,” “Arthur Peters, Private Secretary,” “Paul Jones, Trustee under Deed of Trust dated April 1, 1980,”
                    or “Mary Smith, Donee,” are all acceptable absent some indication that the execution was unauthorized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. Assuming that the shares are registered in the names of two or more persons — as joint tenants or tenants in common, executors or administrators, guardians or conservators, a committee for an incompetent, or trustees — an instrument may be accepted
                    if signed by or on behalf of fewer than all the persons named. This conclusion proceeds on the assumption that the signer or signers have authority to act for the others and there is nothing on the face of the instrument that rebuts
                    this assumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Examples of “reasonable basis for doubt”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase “reasonable basis for doubt” about the validity of a signature or about the signer’s authority creates an objective standard for the exercise of the authority granted by section 7.24(c) to reject proffered instruments. In the absence of a proxy
                    fight or a seriously contested issue, instruments should be rejected only if there seems to be no basis for finding the execution regular on its face. In a proxy fight or other contested issue, the possibility of illegal or unauthorized
                    execution is greatly increased, and a more cautious attitude should therefore be adopted. The following are examples in which a “reasonable basis for doubt” could be found to exist:
                </p>
                <p>
                    a. The shares are registered in the name of “John F. Smith” and the instrument is executed by “Joseph F. Smith” or by “Frank W. Smith.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. The shares are registered in the name of “Ellen Smith, a Minor” or “John Smith, Custodian for Ellen Smith, a Minor,” and the instrument is executed by “Ellen Smith.” There is no “reasonable basis for doubt,” however, if the instrument is accompanied
                    by evidence satisfactory to the corporation that the shareholder is no longer a minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. A proxy appointment is received that is regular on its face, and the secretary or other corporate officer or agent receives a telephone call from a person who identifies himself as the shareholder and says either that he wishes to revoke the appointment
                    or that he did not authorize its original execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    d. Shares are registered in the name of two or more persons as co-owners, the instrument is executed by fewer than all of them, and the instrument shows on its face that not all the registered owners granted authority to the signers, as where the instrument
                    states that it was not possible to obtain all the coowners’ signatures or that some refused to sign. For the normal rule of acceptability of proxies executed by fewer than all co-owners, however, see section 7.24(b)(5) and part 2.e
                    of this Official Comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. The corporation receives a copy of letters of appointment of a receiver, executor, administrator or other fiduciary, and the instrument is executed in the name of the shareholder rather than by the fiduciary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Other principles applicable to proxy appointments
                </p>
                <p>
                    As indicated in the Official Comment to section 7.22, a proxy is simply an agent of the shareholder, and his appointment therefore involves primarily the law of agency. The law of agency determines the rights and duties of the shareholder and the proxy,
                    and it is important to recognize that section 7.24 is not intended to affect these rights and duties. Rather, it recognizes that the great bulk of instruments executed in the name of a shareholder or on his behalf are in fact authorized
                    and the corporation and its officers should be encouraged to accept them rather than to adopt unduly narrow requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) In her married name or in a form that implies her married status, e.g., “Mary Smith Anderson,” “Mrs. Mary S. Anderson,” “Mrs. Mary Smith Anderson,” or “Mrs. Mary Anderson.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. If the shares are registered in the name “Peter Smith, Sr.” but the designation “Sr.” is omitted, e.g., “Peter Smith.” The execution “Peter Smith, Jr.,” however, does not correspond with the shareholder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Examples of executions that “indicate the capacity” of the person signing
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all the following instances, the corporation may request additional evidence of authority but is not required to do so; officers and agents are protected from liability if they routinely accept the instrument without requiring additional evidence.

                </p>
                <p>
                    b. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of a corporation, e.g., “Smith Corporation,” an instrument may be accepted if executed in the name of the corporation, by an officer or agent designated as holding a responsible position, by a person
                    with a surname similar to the corporate name, or simply in the name of the corporation, e.g., “Smith Corporation by John Able, President,” “Smith Corporation by Peter Apt, Agent,” “Smith Corporation by John Smith,” or “Smith Corporation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of an individual who is deceased, incompetent, a minor, in bankruptcy, or in receivership, an instrument may be accepted if it is executed by an executor, administrator, guardian, receiver, or trustee
                    who signs as such. Shares registered in the name of a minor may be voted by a parent of the shareholder if he is identified as such, e.g., “Ralph Able by John Able, Father.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    d. Assuming that the shares are registered in the name of an individual, an instrument may be accepted if it is executed by another individual who indicates (1) that he is signing as an agent or attorney-in-fact for the shareholder (see section 7.22);
                    (2) that he has a close family or other relationship with the shareholder from which authority can be inferred; or (3) that he is the beneficial owner of shares, a pledgee of the shares, or a donee of the shares. For example: if shares
                    are registered in the name of “Peter Jones,” “Ed Smith, Agent,” “Paul Smith, Son,” “Mary Smith Jones, Wife,” “Emelia Able, Attorney,” “Arthur Peters, Private Secretary,” “Paul Jones, Trustee under Deed of Trust dated April 1, 1980,”
                    or “Mary Smith, Donee,” are all acceptable absent some indication that the execution was unauthorized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    e. Assuming that the shares are registered in the names of two or more persons — as joint tenants or tenants in common, executors or administrators, guardians or conservators, a committee for an incompetent, or trustees — an instrument may be accepted
                    if signed by or on behalf of fewer than all the persons named. This conclusion proceeds on the assumption that the signer or signers have authority to act for the others and there is nothing on the face of the instrument that rebuts
                    this assumption.

                <p>
                    Section 7.25 establishes general quorum and voting requirements for voting groups for purposes of the Act. As defined in section 1.40, a “voting group” consists of all shares of one or more classes or series that under the articles of incorporation or
                    the Act are entitled to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter. Shares entitled to vote “generally” on a matter (that is, all shares entitled to vote on the matter by the articles of incorporation or the Act that do
                    not expressly have the right to be counted separately) are a single voting group. On most matters coming before shareholders’ meetings, only a single voting group, consisting of a class of voting shares, will be involved, and action
                    on such a matter is effective when approved by that voting group pursuant to section 7.25. See section 7.26(a).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.25 covers quorum and voting requirements for all actions by the shareholders of a corporation with a single class of voting shares. It also covers quorum and voting requirements for a matter on which only a class or series of shares is entitled
                    to vote under the articles of incorporation, for example, when a class with preferential rights may vote to elect directors because of a default in the payment of dividends (a vote which is often described as a “class vote”). Finally,
                    section 7.25 also covers quorum and voting requirements for a matter on which both common and preferred shares or separate classes or series of common or preferred shares are entitled to vote, either together as a single voting group
                    under the articles of incorporation or separately as two or more voting groups under either the articles of incorporation or the Act. See section 7.26(b).

                <p>
                    Under the Act, classes or series of shares are generally not entitled to vote separately by voting group except to the extent specifically authorized by the articles of incorporation. But sections 9.21, 9.32, 10.04, and 11.04 of the Act grant classes
                    or series of shares the right to vote separately when fundamental changes are proposed that may adversely affect that class or series. Section 10.04(c) further provides that when two or more classes or series are affected by an amendment
                    covered by section 10.04 in essentially the same way, the classes or series are grouped together and must vote as a single voting group rather than as multiple voting groups on the matter, unless otherwise provided in the articles
                    of incorporation or required by the board of directors. Section 7.25(f) provides that the group voting rule of section 10.04(c), including the ability to vary that rule in the articles of incorporation or by action of the board of
                    directors, also applies to the group voting provisions in sections 9.21, 9.32, and 11.04. Under the Act even a class or series of shares that is expressly described as nonvoting under the articles of incorporation may be entitled to
                    vote separately on an amendment to the articles of incorporation that affects the class or series in a designated way. See section 10.04(d).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the provisions of the Act, separate voting by voting group may be authorized by the articles of incorporation (except that the statutory privilege of voting by separate voting groups cannot be diluted or reduced). On some matters, the board
                    of directors may condition its submission of matters to shareholders on their approval by specific voting groups designated by the board of directors. Sections 7.25 and 7.26 establish the mechanics by which all voting by single or
                    multiple voting groups is carried out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some situations, shares of a single class or series may be entitled to vote in two different voting groups. See the Official Comment to section 7.26.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation’s determination of the voting groups entitled to vote, and the quorum and voting requirements applicable to that determination, should be determined separately for each matter coming before a meeting. As a result, different quorum and voting
                    requirements may be applicable to different portions of a meeting, depending on the matter being considered. In the normal case where only a single voting group is entitled to vote on all matters coming before a meeting of shareholders,
                    a single quorum and voting requirement will usually be applicable to the entire meeting. To reflect the possibility that shares may have multiple or fractional votes per share, the provisions relating to quorums are phrased in terms
                    of votes represented by shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 7.25(b), once a share is present at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes throughout the meeting. Thus, a voting group may continue to act despite the withdrawal of persons having the power to vote one or more shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shares owned by a shareholder who comes to the meeting to object on grounds of lack of notice are considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Similarly, shares owned by a shareholder who attends a meeting solely for purposes
                    of raising the objection that a quorum is not present are considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Attendance at a meeting, however, does not constitute a waiver of other objections to the meeting such
                    as the lack of notice. Such waivers are governed by section 7.06(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a new record date is set, new notice must be given to holders of shares of a voting group and a quorum must be established from within the holders of shares of that voting group as of the new record date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.25(c) provides that an action (other than the election of directors, which is governed by section 7.28) is approved by a voting group at a meeting at which a quorum is present if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing
                    the action, unless the articles of incorporation require a greater number of votes. This default rule differs from a formulation appearing in some state statutes that an action is approved at a meeting at which a quorum is present
                    if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at that meeting. That formulation in effect treats abstentions as negative votes; the Act treats them truly as abstentions. For example, if a corporation (that
                    has not, through the articles of incorporation, modified quorum and voting requirements) has 1,000 shares of a single class outstanding, each share entitled to cast one vote, a quorum consists of 501 shares; if 600 shares are represented
                    at the meeting and the vote on a proposed action is 280 in favor, 225 opposed, and 95 abstaining, the action would not be approved in a state following the formulation that treats abstentions as negative votes because fewer than a
                    majority of the 600 shares attending voted in favor of the action. Under section 7.25(c) the action would be approved and not be defeated by the 95 abstaining votes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The articles of incorporation may modify the quorum and voting requirements of section 7.25 for a single voting group or for all voting groups entitled to vote on any matter. The articles of incorporation may increase the quorum and voting requirements
                    to any extent desired up to and including unanimity, subject to section 7.27. They may also require that shares of different classes or series are entitled to vote separately or together on specific issues or provide that actions are
                    approved only if they receive the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of a voting group present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The articles may also decrease the quorum requirement as desired, subject to section
                    7.25(a) and section 7.27.

                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (a) to bring forward the provisions of former G.S. 55-65(d), which permitted adjournment of a meeting in the absence of a quorum until a quorum is present. Subsections (a), (c) and (d) were modified to provide
                    that special quorum and voting requirements can be established by a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, as well as by the articles of incorporation or the provisions of this Act.

                <p>
                    Section 7.26(a) provides that when a matter is to be voted upon by a single voting group, action is taken when the voting group votes upon the action as provided in section 7.25. In most instances the single voting group will consist of all the shares
                    of the class or classes entitled to vote by the articles of incorporation; voting by two or more voting groups as contemplated by section 7.26(b) is the exceptional case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.26(b) basically requires that if more than one voting group is entitled to vote on a matter, favorable action on a matter is taken only when it is voted upon favorably by each voting group, counted separately. Implicit in this section are the
                    concepts that (1) different quorum and voting requirements may be applicable to different matters considered at a single meeting and (2) different quorum and voting requirements may be applicable to different voting groups voting on
                    the same matter. See the Official Comment to section 7.25. Thus, each group entitled to vote must independently meet the quorum and voting requirements established by section 7.25. But if a quorum is present for one or more voting
                    groups but not for all voting groups, section 7.26(b) provides that the voting groups for which a quorum is present may vote upon the matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A single meeting, furthermore, may consider matters on which action by several voting groups is required and also matters on which only a single voting group may act. Action may be taken on the matters on which the single voting group may act even though
                    no quorum is present to take action on other matters. For example, in a corporation with one class of nonvoting shares with preferential rights (“preferred shares”) and one class of general voting shares without preferential rights
                    (“common shares”), a matter to be considered at the annual meeting may be a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation that reduces the cumulative dividend right of the preferred shares (a matter on which the preferred shares
                    have a statutory right to vote as a separate voting group). Other matters to be considered may include the election of directors and the appointment of an auditor, both matters on which the preferred shares have no vote. If a quorum
                    of the voting group consisting of the common shares but no quorum of the voting group consisting of the preferred shares is present, the common shares may proceed to elect directors and appoint the auditor. The common shares voting
                    group may also vote to approve the proposed amendment to the articles of the incorporation, but that amendment will not be approved until the preferred shares voting group also votes to approve the amendment.

                <p>
                    In many multiple voting group situations under the Model Act, proposals are adopted only if a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group approve the proposal. This percentage of votes is higher than that required by section 7.25,
                    and is required, for example, under sections 10.03(e)(1) and 10.04(b) for all amendments to articles of incorporation that create dissenters’ rights with respect to part or all of the shares of the voting group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As described in section 7.26(b), if voting by multiple voting groups is required, the votes of members of each voting group must be separately tabulated. Normally, each class or series of shares will participate in only a single voting group. But since
                    holders of shares entitled by the articles of incorporation to vote generally on a matter are always entitled to vote in the voting group consisting of the general voting shares, in some instances classes or series of shares may be
                    entitled to be counted simultaneously in two voting groups. This will occur whenever a class or series of shares entitled to vote generally on a matter under the articles of incorporation is affected by the matter in a way that gives
                    rise to the right to have its vote counted separately as an independent voting group under the Act. For example, assume that corporation Y has outstanding one class of general voting shares without preferential rights (“common shares”),
                    500 shares issued, and one class of shares with preferential rights (“preferred shares”), 100 shares issued, that also have full voting rights under the articles of incorporation, i.e., the preferred may vote for election of directors
                    and on all other matters on which common may vote. The preferred and the common therefore are part of the general voting group. The directors propose to amend the articles of incorporation to change the preferential dividend rights
                    of the preferred from cumulative to noncumulative. All shares are present at the meeting and they divide as follows on the proposal to adopt the amendment:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes — Common 230 — Preferred 80 No — Common 270 — Preferred 20. Both the preferred and the common are entitled to vote on the amendment to the articles of incorporation since they are part of a general voting group pursuant to the articles. But the vote
                    of the preferred is also entitled to be counted separately on the proposal by section 10.04(a)(4) of the Model Act. The result is that the proposal passes by a vote of 310 to 290 in the voting group consisting of the shares entitled
                    to vote generally and 80 to 20 in the voting group consisting solely of the preferred shares: :GB (a) First voting group Yes: Common 230 Preferred 80 310 No: Common 270 Preferred 20 290 :GX (b) Second voting group (preferred) Yes:
                    Preferred 80 No: Preferred 20

                <p>
                    In this situation, in the absence of a special quorum requirement, a meeting could approve the proposal to amend the articles of incorporation if — and only if — a quorum of each voting group is present, i.e., at least 51 shares of preferred and 301 shares
                    of common and preferred were represented at the meeting.

                    Section 7.27(a) permits the articles of incorporation to increase the quorum or voting requirements for approval of an action by shareholders up to any desired amount including unanimity. These provisions may relate to ordinary or routine actions by the
                    general voting group (which otherwise may be acted upon under section 7.25 if the number of affirmative votes exceeds the number of negative votes at a meeting at which a quorum of that voting group is present) or to one or more other
                    voting groups or to actions for which the Model Act provides a greater voting requirement — for example, changes of a fundamental nature in the corporation like certain amendments to articles of incorporation (section 10.03), mergers
                    (section 11.03), sales of all or substantially all the property of a corporation not in the ordinary course of business (section 12.02), and dissolution (section 14.02). Generally, the Model Act requires these fundamental changes to
                    receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the proposal by each voting group entitled to vote thereon rather than by a majority of the shares voting affirmatively or negatively at a meeting at which
                    a quorum is present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A provision that increases the requirement for approval of an ordinary matter or a fundamental change is usually referred to as a “supermajority” provision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.27(b) requires any amendment of the articles of incorporation that adds, modifies, or repeals any supermajority provision to be approved by the greater of the proposed quorum and vote requirement or by the quorum and vote required by the articles
                    before their amendment. Thus, a supermajority provision that requires an 80 percent affirmative vote of all eligible votes of a voting group present at the meeting may not be removed from the articles of incorporation or reduced in
                    any way except by an 80 percent affirmative vote. If the 80 percent requirement is coupled with a quorum requirement for a voting group that shares representing two-thirds of the total votes must be present in person or by proxy, both
                    the 80 percent voting requirement and the two-thirds quorum requirement are immune from reduction except at a meeting of the voting group at which the two-thirds quorum requirement is met and the reduction is approved by an 80 percent
                    affirmative vote. If the proposal is to increase the 80 percent voting requirement to 90 percent, that proposal must be approved by a 90 percent affirmative vote at a meeting of the voting group at which the two-thirds quorum requirement
                    is met; if the proposal is to increase the two-thirds quorum requirement to three-fourths without changing the 80 percent voting requirement, that proposal must be approved by an 80 percent affirmative vote at a meeting of the voting
                    group at which a three-fourths quorum requirement is met.

                    Section 7.28(a) provides that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in an election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present of the voting group entitled to participate in the election. A “plurality” means that the individuals
                    with the largest number of votes are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the election. In elections in which several factions are competing within a voting group, the individuals elected may have
                    fewer than a majority of all the votes cast in the election. The articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation may, however, provide a different manner of election of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire board of directors may be elected by a single voting group or the articles of incorporation may provide that different voting groups are entitled to elect a designated number or fraction of the board of directors. See section 8.04. Elections
                    are contested only within specific voting groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 7.28(b) each corporation may determine whether or not to elect its directors by cumulative voting. If directors are elected by different voting groups, the articles of incorporation may provide that specified voting groups are entitled to
                    vote cumulatively while others are not. Cumulative voting affects the manner in which votes may be cast by shares participating in the election but does not affect the plurality principle set forth in section 7.28(a).

                <p>
                    Section 7.28(b) provides basically for an “opt in” election. A corporation has cumulative voting with respect to a voting group only if an affirmative provision to that effect appears in its articles of incorporation. Under section 7.28(c) this election
                    may be made simply by inserting a statement that “all directors are elected by cumulative voting” or “holders of class A shares are entitled to cumulate their votes,” or words of similar import. The effect of such a statement is to
                    make applicable automatically the detailed provisions of subsections (c) and (d) describing the cumulative right to vote at elections of directors by the voting group or groups specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.28(c) describes the mechanics of cumulative voting: each shareholder may multiply the number of votes he is entitled to cast (based on the number of shares held by him) by the number of directors to be elected by the voting group at the meeting
                    and may cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates. By casting all his votes for a single candidate or a limited number of candidates, a minority shareholder increases his voting
                    power and may be able to elect one or more directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.28(d) applies only if cumulative voting is potentially available under section 7.28(b). It is designed to ensure that all shareholders participating in the election understand the rules and to avoid the distortions that may be created when some
                    shareholders vote cumulatively while others do not. Cumulative voting will be employed if the notice of meeting or accompanying proxy statement conspicuously announces that a shareholder is entitled to cumulate his votes or a shareholder
                    who is entitled to vote gives notice to the corporation of his intent to do so at least 48 hours before the meeting. This notice puts the corporation and all shareholders who are entitled to vote in the election with that shareholder
                    on notice that voting will be on a cumulative basis. If this notice is given by any shareholder, all other shareholders who are part of the same voting group are entitled to vote cumulatively without giving further notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proxy regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission require proxy statements to include a statement that persons have the right to vote cumulatively, if that is the case, and briefly to describe that right.

                        Under former G.S. 55-68, before the right of cumulative voting may be exercised, four things must be done: (1) A shareholder must announce in the open meeting, before the voting starts, that he intends to vote cumulatively; (2) upon such an announcement,
                        the chair must declare that all shares have the right to vote cumulatively; (3) the chair must announce the number of shares present in person or by proxy; and (4) the chair must declare a recess of not less than one hour nor more
                        than four hours, unless a different time period is unanimously agreed upon. Stancil v. Bruce Stancil Refrigeration, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 344 S.E.2d 789, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2336 (1986).

                        The four requirements imposed by former G.S. 55-68(c) for the exercise of cumulative voting were designed, among other things, (1) to prevent a shareholder, by a surprise announcement of his intention to vote cumulatively, from taking unfair advantage
                        of other shareholders, and (2) to permit the shareholders an opportunity to determine how their votes may be distributed to their best advantage. Stancil v.

                <p>
                    A voting trust is a device by which one or more shareholders divorce the voting rights of their shares from the ownership, retaining the latter but transferring the former to one or more trustees in whom the voting rights of all the shareholders who are
                    parties to the trust are pooled. Section 7.30(a) provides a straightforward procedure for the creation of an enforceable voting trust and does not impose narrow or technical requirements. Typically, the voting trust provides that all
                    attributes of beneficial ownership other than the power to vote are retained by the voting trust beneficial owners. In addition, the voting trustees may issue to the voting trust beneficial owners voting trust certificates which may
                    be transferable in the same way as shares. Section 7.30 does not limit the duration of a voting trust, consistent with section 7.32 governing shareholder agreements generally. Section 7.30 permits participants to specify limits but
                    does not establish an automatic sunset provision as a matter of law. Section 7.30(c) addresses voting trusts entered into when the Act limited their duration to 10 years.

       Official Comment to the Model Business Corporation Act, 2016 Revision
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shareholders of some corporations, especially those that are closely held, frequently enter into agreements that govern the operation of the enterprise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32 provides, within the context of the traditional corporate structure, legal certainty to such agreements that embody various aspects of the business arrangement established by the shareholders to meet their business and personal needs. The
                    subject matter of these arrangements includes governance of the entity, allocation of the economic return from the business, and other aspects of the relationships among shareholders, directors, and the corporation which are part of
                    the business arrangement. Section 7.32 also recognizes that many of the corporate norms contained in the Act were designed with an eye towards corporations whose management and share ownership are distinct. These functions are often
                    conjoined in some corporations, such as the close corporation. Thus, section 7.32 validates agreements among shareholders even when the agreements are inconsistent with the statutory norms contained in the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, section 7.32 only addresses the parties to the shareholder agreement, their transferees, and the corporation, and does not have any binding legal effect on the state, creditors, or other third persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32 supplements the other provisions of the Act. If an agreement is not in conflict with another section of the Act, no resort need be made to section 7.32 with its requirement of unanimity. For example, special provisions may be included in
                    the articles of incorporation or bylaws with less than unanimous shareholder agreement so long as such provisions are not in conflict with other provisions of the Act. Similarly, section 7.32 would not have to be relied upon to validate
                    typical buy-sell agreements among two or more shareholders or the covenants and other terms of a stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of shares by a corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    =p0:0
                    <i>
       1. Section 7.32(a)
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An agreement authorized by section 7.32 is “not inconsistent with law” within the meaning of sections 2.02(b)(2) and 2.06(b) of the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The range of agreements validated by section 7.32(a) is expansive though not unlimited. Section 7.32 defines the types of agreements that can be validated largely by illustration. The seven specific categories that are listed are designed to cover some
                    of the most frequently used arrangements. There are numerous other arrangements that may be made, and section 7.32(a)(8) provides an additional category for any provisions that, in a manner inconsistent with any other provision of
                    the Act, otherwise govern the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship between and among the shareholders, the directors, and the corporation or any of them,
                    and are not contrary to public policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32(a) validates virtually all types of shareholder agreements that, in practice, normally concern shareholders and their advisors. Given that breadth, any provision that may be contained in the articles of incorporation with a majority vote
                    under sections 2.02(b)(2)(ii) and (iii), as well as under section 2.02(b)(4), may also be effective if contained in a shareholder agreement that complies with section 7.32.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provisions of a shareholder agreement authorized by section 7.32(a) will often, in operation, conflict with the language of more than one section of the Act, and courts should in such cases construe all related sections of the Act flexibly and in
                    a manner consistent with the underlying intent of the shareholder agreement. Thus, for example, in the case of an agreement that provides for weighted voting by directors, every reference in the Act to a majority or other proportion
                    of directors should be construed to refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the limits of section 7.32(a)(8) are left uncertain, there are provisions of the Act that may not be overridden if they reflect core principles of public policy with respect to corporate affairs. For example, a provision of a shareholder agreement
                    that purports to eliminate all of the standards of conduct established under section 8.30 might be viewed as contrary to public policy and thus not validated under section 7.32(a)(8). Similarly, a provision that exculpates directors
                    from liability more broadly than permitted by section 2.02(b)(4), or indemnifies them more broadly than permitted by section 2.02(b)(5), might not be validated under section 7.32 because of strong public policy reasons for the statutory
                    limitations on the right to exculpate directors from liability and to indemnify them. The validity of some provisions may depend upon the circumstances. For example, a provision of a shareholder agreement that limited inspection rights
                    under section 16.02 or the right to financial statements under section 16.20 might, as a general matter, be valid, but that provision might not be given effect if it prevented shareholders from obtaining information necessary to determine
                    whether directors of the corporation have satisfied the standards of conduct under section 8.30. The foregoing are examples and are not intended to be exclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As noted above, shareholder agreements otherwise validated by section 7.32 are not legally binding on the state, on creditors, or on other third parties. For example, an agreement that dispenses with the need to make corporate filings required by the
                    Act would be ineffective. Similarly, an agreement among shareholders that provides that only the president has authority to enter into contracts for the corporation would not, without more, be binding against third parties, and ordinary
                    principles of agency, including the concept of apparent authority, would continue to apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       2. Section 7.32(b)
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32 minimizes the formal requirements for a shareholder agreement so as not to restrict unduly the shareholders’ ability to take advantage of the flexibility the section provides. Thus, it is not necessary to “opt in” to a special class of close
                    corporations to obtain the benefits of section 7.32. An agreement can be validated under section 7.32 whether it is set forth in the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or in a separate agreement, and regardless of whether section
                    7.32 is specifically referenced in the agreement. Where the corporation has a single shareholder, the requirement of an “agreement among the shareholders” is satisfied by the unilateral action of the shareholder in establishing the
                    terms of the agreement, evidenced by provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or in a writing signed by the sole shareholder. Although a writing signed by all the shareholders is not required where the agreement is contained
                    in articles of incorporation or bylaws unanimously approved, it may be desirable to have all the shareholders actually sign the instrument to establish unequivocally their agreement. Similarly, although transferees are bound by a valid
                    shareholder agreement, subject to section 7.32(c), it may be desirable to obtain the affirmative written assent of the transferee at the time of the transfer. Section 7.32(b) also establishes and permits amendments by less than unanimous
                    agreement if the shareholder agreement so provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32(b) requires unanimous shareholder approval of the shareholder agreement regardless of entitlement to vote. Unanimity is required because an agreement authorized by section 7.32 can effect material organic changes in the corporation’s operation
                    and structure, and in the rights and obligations of shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The requirement that the shareholder agreement be made known to the corporation is the predicate for the requirement in section 7.32(c) that share certificates or information statements be legended to note the existence of the agreement. No specific form
                    of notification is required and the agreement need not be filed with the corporation. In the case of shareholder agreements in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the corporation will necessarily have notice. In the case of a
                    shareholder agreement outside the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the requirement of signatures by all of the shareholders should in virtually all cases be sufficient to make the corporation aware of the agreement, as one or more
                    signatories will normally also be a director or an officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       3. Section 7.32(c)
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32(c) addresses the effect of a shareholder agreement on subsequent purchasers or transferees of shares. Typically, corporations with shareholder agreements also have restrictions on the transferability of the shares as authorized by section
                    6.27, thus lessening the practical effects of the problem in the context of voluntary transferees. Transferees of shares without knowledge of the agreement or those acquiring shares upon the death of an original participant in a close
                    corporation may, however, be heavily affected. Weighing the burdens on transferees against the burdens on the remaining shareholders in the enterprise, section 7.32(c) affirms the continued validity of the shareholder agreement on
                    all transferees, whether by purchase, gift, operation of law, or otherwise. Unlike restrictions on transfer, it may be impossible to enforce a shareholder agreement against less than all of the shareholders. Thus, under section 7.32,
                    one who inherits shares subject to a shareholder agreement must continue to abide by the agreement. If that is not the desired result, care must be exercised at the initiation of the shareholder agreement to ensure a different outcome,
                    such as providing for a buy-back upon death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where shares are transferred to a purchaser without knowledge of a shareholder agreement, the validity of the agreement is similarly unaffected, but the purchaser is afforded a rescission remedy against the seller. Under section 7.32(c), the time at which
                    notice to a purchaser is relevant for purposes of determining entitlement to rescission is the time when a purchaser acquires the shares rather than when a commitment is made to acquire the shares. If the purchaser learns of the agreement
                    after committing to purchase but before acquiring the shares, the purchaser may not proceed with the purchase and still obtain the benefit of the remedies in section 7.32(c). Under contract principles and the securities laws, a failure
                    to disclose the existence of a shareholder agreement may constitute the omission of a material fact and may excuse performance of the commitment to purchase. The term “purchaser” includes a person acquiring shares upon initial issue
                    or by transfer, and also includes a pledgee, for whom the time of purchase is the time the shares are pledged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32 addresses the underlying rights of shares and shareholders and the validity of shareholder action which redefines those rights, as contrasted with questions regarding entitlement to ownership of the security, competing ownership claims, and
                    disclosure issues. Consistent with this dichotomy, the rights and remedies available to purchasers under section 7.32(c) are independent of those provided by contract law, Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the securities laws,
                    and other laws outside the Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With respect to the related subject of restrictions on transferability of shares, note that section 7.32 does not directly address or validate such restrictions, which are governed instead by section 6.27 of the Act. However, if such restrictions are
                    adopted as a part of a shareholder agreement that complies with the requirements of section 7.32, a court should apply the concept of reasonableness under section 6.27 in determining the validity of such restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32(c) contains an affirmative requirement that the share certificate or information statement for the shares be legended to note the existence of a shareholder agreement. No specified form of legend is required, and a simple statement that “[t]he
                    shares represented by this certificate are subject to a shareholder agreement” is sufficient. At that point, a purchaser must obtain a copy of the shareholder agreement from the transferor or proceed at the purchaser’s peril. In the
                    event a corporation fails to legend share certificates or information statements, a court may, in an appropriate case, imply a cause of action against the corporation in favor of an injured purchaser without knowledge of a shareholder
                    agreement. The circumstances under which such a remedy would be implied, the proper measure of damages, and other attributes of and limitations on such an implied remedy are left to development in the courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A purchaser who has no actual knowledge of a shareholder agreement and is not charged with knowledge by virtue of a legend on the certificate or information statement has a rescission remedy against the transferor (which would be the corporation in the
                    case of a new issue of shares).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the shares are certificated and duly legended, a purchaser is charged with notice of the shareholder agreement even if the purchaser never saw the certificate. In the case of uncertificated shares, however, the purchaser is not charged with notice
                    of the shareholder agreement unless a duly-legended information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or before the time of purchase. This different rule for uncertificated shares is intended to provide an additional safeguard
                    to protect innocent purchasers, and is necessary because section 6.26(b) of the Act and Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code permit delivery of statements after a transfer of shares.

      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.32(d) recognizes that the terms of a shareholder agreement may provide for its termination upon the happening of a specified event or condition. An example may be when the corporation undergoes an initial public offering. This approach is consistent
                    with the broad freedom of contract provided to participants in such enterprises.

                <p>
                    Section 7.32(e) provides a shift of liability from the directors to any person or persons in whom the discretion or powers otherwise exercised by the board of directors are vested under the shareholder agreement. A shareholder agreement which provides
                    for such a shift of responsibility, with the concomitant shift of liability provided by subsection § 7.32(e), could also provide for exculpation from that liability to the extent otherwise authorized by the Act. The transfer of liability
                    provided by subsection § 7.32(e) covers liabilities imposed on directors “by law,” which is intended to include liabilities arising under the Act, the common law, and statutory law outside the Act.

                <p>
                    Section 7.32(f) provides that shareholders shall not have personal liability for the debts of a corporation arising out of acts or omissions taken pursuant to a shareholder agreement validated by section 7.32. Section 7.32(g) authorizes shareholder agreements
                    for corporations that are in the process of being organized and do not yet have shareholders.

                <p>
                    Section 7.32 does not limit the duration of a shareholder agreement. This approach is consistent with the wide freedom of contract provided to participants in such enterprises. For agreements entered into during a time that section 7.32 provided for a
                    10-year term if no other time limit was specified, section 7.32(h) provides that its duration will be governed by the provisions of section 7.32 concerning duration in force at the time the agreement became effective. This would include,
                    for example, both the default termination rule and the authority under former section 7.32(b)(2) that such an agreement’s automatic 10-year term could be amended by all shareholders (unless the agreement had prohibited such amendment).

                            Former G.S. 55-73 was not intended to, and it did not, define “shareholders’ agreements” to mean only those arrangements which were an attempt to treat the corporation as if it were a partnership or which arranged relationships in a manner that would
                            be appropriate only between partners. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The authorization of shareholders’ agreements was a recognition of the needs of stockholders in a close corporation to be able to protect themselves from each other and from hostile invaders. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).

                        <p>
                            The reason for phrasing the provisions of the statute mainly in the negative was to provide latitude to both the shareholders who enter into agreements which relate to the affairs of the corporation and to the courts which must construe and assess their
                            contracts. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).

                            The provisions of former G.S. 55-73 were designed to permit the management of close corporations by shareholders thereof who act by other than normal corporate procedures, and such actions by the shareholders, if so intended, must perforce bind the corporation.

                            With respect to close corporations, the heart of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act was former G.S. 55-73. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).

                            By means of a shareholders’ agreement a small group of investors who seek gain from direct participation in their business and not from trading its stock or securities in the open market can adopt the decision-making procedures of partnership, avoid the
                            consequences of majority rule (the standard operating procedure for corporations), and still enjoy the tax advantages and limited liability of a corporation. Such businesses are often called “incorporated partnerships.” Blount

                            A shareholders’ agreement is a contract between shareholders which may apply broadly to the rights of the shareholders in conducting the business of the corporation, so long as their purposes are legal and not contrary to public policy. Blount v. Taft,

                            In a broad sense the term “shareholders’ agreement” refers to any agreement among two or more shareholders regarding their conduct in relation to the corporation whose shares they own. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).

                            246 S.E.2d 763, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (1978).

                            Those who have the burden of proving a valid shareholders’ agreement could ease this burden by offering an agreement in writing signed by all shareholders, or if embodied in the charter or bylaws, explicit designation therein of a shareholders’ agreement
                            and provision for alteration of the agreement if different from the alteration or amendment provisions applicable to the charter or bylaw provisions which are not within the agreement. Blount v. Taft,

                            Since consensual arrangements among shareholders are agreements — the products of negotiation — they should be construed and enforced like any other contract so as to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in their agreements, unless they
                            violate the express charter or statutory provision, contemplate an illegal object, involve fraud, oppression or wrong against other shareholders, or are made in consideration of a private benefit to the promisor. Blount v.

                            Subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 created no distinctions between a shareholders’ agreement in which the parties sought to deal with the corporation as a partnership and any other stockholders’ agreement which related to any phase of the affairs of
                            the corporation. It added nothing, either expressly or impliedly, to the words of the agreement; nor did it suspend the rules of contract law relating to its construction, modification or rescission. It merely provided that
                            a shareholders’ agreement in which the parties sought to deal with affairs of the corporation in a manner which would be appropriate only between partners was not invalid for that reason. Blount v. Taft,

                            To meet the requirements of subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 for establishing a valid shareholders’ agreement in a close corporation, there had to be an agreement in writing of all shareholders; but the writing could consist of a written provision
                            in the charter or bylaws of the corporation which could be based on an oral agreement which had been embodied therein. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 225 S.E.2d 583,

                <p>
                    Section 7.40 deals with the procedural requirements applicable to derivative suits. A great deal of controversy has surrounded the derivative suit, and widely different perceptions as to the value and efficacy of this litigation continue to exist. On
                    the one hand, the derivative action has historically been the principal method of challenging allegedly improper, illegal, or unreasonable action by management. On the other hand, it has long been recognized that the derivative suit
                    may be instituted more with a view to obtaining a settlement favorable to the plaintiff and his attorney than to righting a wrong to the corporation (the so-called “strike suit”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier versions of section 7.40, and similar statutes in many states, imposed a series of procedural requirements designed in part to deter or prevent strike suits. The FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, rule 23.1, also imposes procedural requirements
                    on derivative litigation brought in federal court. There has thus been a great deal of experience with procedural devices to control abuses of the derivative suit. Section 7.40 reflects a reappraisal of these devices in light of major
                    developments in corporate governance, the public demand for corporate accountability, and the corporate response in the form of greater independence and sense of responsibility in boards of directors.

                    The procedural requirements imposed by section 7.40 are as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many statutes, including earlier versions of the Model Act, required the plaintiff to be a shareholder “of record.” This limiting requirement was dropped in revising section 7.40, in light of the widespread use of street name or nominee ownership of shares.
                    At the same time, it was determined that the beneficial owner of shares held in a voting trust should also be permitted to serve as a plaintiff in a derivative suit. These changes were accomplished by the addition of a special definition
                    of “shareholder” in subsection (e) to broaden the definition of that term in section 1.40.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act and the statutes of many states have long imposed a “contemporaneous ownership” rule, i.e., the plaintiff must have been an owner of shares at the time of the transaction in question. This rule has been criticized as being unduly narrow
                    and technical and unnecessary to prevent the transfer or purchase of lawsuits. A few states, particularly California, Cal. G.C.L. § 800(B), have relaxed this rule to the extent of allowing some subsequent purchasers of shares to be
                    plaintiffs in limited circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision to retain the contemporaneous ownership rule in section 7.40 was based primarily on the view that it was simple, clear, and easy to apply while the California approach might encourage litigation on peripheral issues like the extent of the
                    plaintiff’s knowledge of the transaction in question when he acquired his shares. Further, there has been no persuasive showing that the contemporaneous ownership rule has prevented the litigation of substantial suits since there appear
                    to be many persons who might qualify as plaintiffs to bring suit even if subsequent purchasers are disqualified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.40(b) requires the complaint in a derivative suit to be verified, i.e., sworn to. Compare FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, rule 23.1;
                    <i>
       Surowitz v. Hilton Hotels Corp.,
      </i> 383 U.S. 363 (1966). This requirement provides some protection against groundless litigation without deterring suits brought in good faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arguments may be made that long-term creditors and investors with the privilege of becoming shareholders by the exercise of options or conversion rights should be permitted to bring derivative suits. These arguments, however, appear to involve the substantive
                    rights of these various classes of investors more than the procedures required for the assertion of derivative rights on behalf of the corporation. See, e.g.,
                    <i>
       Harff v. Kerkorian,
      </i> 324 A.2d 215 (Del. Ch. 1974), rev’d in part, 347 A.2d 133 (Del. 1975). Therefore, section 7.40(a) does not permit option holders or convertible debenture holders to serve as derivative plaintiffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of a demand on the board of directors is to stimulate the board of directors to enforce the rights of the corporation on its own. Modern trends in corporate governance—particularly the increasing number of outside directors and greater directors
                    sensitivity to their roles in the corporation and to the possibility of personal liability—improve the likelihood that the board of directors will weigh carefully the shareholder’s demand. Therefore, section 7.40(b) requires an allegation
                    with particularity of the demand made, if any, on the board of directors. On the other hand, there may be circumstances showing that a demand on the board of directors would be useless, and in those circumstances it should be sufficient
                    to allege the reasons why the plaintiff did not make the demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of itself, the rejection by the board of directors of the shareholder’s demand neither permits nor precludes the shareholder’s suit. See paragraph 2a. below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rule 23.1 of the FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE requires that, in addition to a demand on the board of directors, a demand be made on shareholders “if necessary.” The statutes of a number of states, including California and New York, require demands
                    only on boards of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although a demand on shareholders seems generally consistent with the broad doctrine of requiring exhaustion of all internal avenues of relief before commencement of suit, the board of directors, not the shareholders, is charged with governance of the
                    corporation, including the commencement and management of litigation. Further, to require a demand on shareholders would virtually require the plaintiff to engage in a preliminary proxy contest and, in the case of publicly held corporations,
                    would greatly increase the costs of filing all derivative suits, discouraging even legitimate cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For these reasons, it was concluded that the requirement of a demand on shareholders would add uncertainty, expense, and delay without commensurately improving the prospects of resolving the substantive issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last sentence of section 7.40(b) provides that if the corporation undertakes an investigation, the court may stay the proceeding until the investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint is completed. The purpose of this stay is to preserve
                    the right of the board of directors to consider whether or not to seek to enforce on its own the corporation’s claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states required a plaintiff to give security for reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, if his holdings of shares did not reach a specified size or value—five percent of the outstanding
                    shares or a value of $25,000 in the earlier version of the Model Act. This requirement has been deleted. The security for expenses requirement, to the extent it was based on the size or value of the plaintiff’s holdings rather than
                    on the apparent good faith of his claim, was subject to criticism that it unreasonably discriminated against small shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic policy question with respect to the requirement of a bond for small shareholders is how far to go in protecting the corporation and its officers and directors from suits. The choice is between making the right to sue widely available, without
                    obstacles except in obviously baseless cases, or imposing obstacles in the way of the small shareholder without imposing a similar obstacle in the way of the large shareholder. Moreover, no bond requirement exists for class actions,
                    antitrust cases, or individual actions for personal injury, all of which involve the corporation in substantial expense of defending against suit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several states have concluded on the basis of these considerations that the bond requirement for small plaintiffs should be repealed or not adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In lieu of the bond requirement, section 7.40(d) provides that on termination of a proceeding the court may require the complainant to pay the defendants’ reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, if it finds that the proceeding “was commenced without
                    reasonable cause.” This test is similar to but not identical with the test utilized in section 13.31, relating to dissenters’ rights, where the standard for award of expenses and attorneys’ fees is that dissenters “acted arbitrarily,
                    vexatiously or not in good faith” in demanding a judicial appraisal of their shares. The derivative action situation is sufficiently different from the dissenters’ rights situation to justify a different and less onerous test for imposing
                    costs on the plaintiff. The test of section 7.40 that the action was brought without reasonable cause is appropriate to deter strike suits, on the one hand, and on the other hand to protect plaintiffs whose suits have a reasonable
                    foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.40(d) does not refer to the award of expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to successful plaintiffs. The right of successful plaintiffs in derivative suits to this recovery is so universally recognized, both by statute and on the theory of a
                    recovery of a fund or benefit for the corporation, that specific reference was thought to be unnecessary. The intention is to preserve fully these nonstatutory rights of reimbursement. Therefore, no negative inference should be drawn
                    from section 7.40(d) as to the rights of plaintiffs to reimbursement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abuses in the conduct of derivative litigation may occur on the part of defendants and their counsel as well as by plaintiffs and their counsel. Abuses may occur with respect to motions, pleadings, requests for discovery and resistance to discovery when
                    conducted either in bad faith or without good cause. Sanctions to deal with such conduct are not included in this Act because courts possess adequate power to impose appropriate sanctions under rules of civil procedure or the general
                    equity power of courts. See
                    <i>
       Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper,
      </i> 447 U.S. 752 (1980).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.40(c) follows the FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, and the statutes of a number of states, including New York and Michigan, and requires that all proposed settlements and discontinuances must receive judicial approval. This requirement seems
                    a natural consequence of the proposition that a derivative suit is brought on behalf of the class of all shareholders and avoids many of the evils of the strike suit by preventing the individual shareholder-plaintiff from settling
                    privately with the defendants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 7.40(c) also requires notice to all affected shareholders if the court determines that the proposed settlement may substantially affect the interest of one or more classes of shareholders. Unlike the statutes of some states, however, section 7.40(c)
                    does not address the issue of which party should bear the cost of giving this notice. That is a matter left to the discretion of the court reviewing the proposed settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Issues unresolved by section 7.40
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several issues relating to section 7.40 were reserved for future consideration because it was felt that further experience or experimentation was desirable before their resolution was encapsulated in model statutory language. The issues so reserved include
                    the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       a. Should a decision by the board of directors that maintenance of a derivative suit is against the corporation’s interest bar the suit?
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The case law concerning the power of the board of directors or of an independent committee of the board to bar a derivative suit without judicial review is in a state of flux. See, e.g.,
                    <i>
       Burks v. Lasker,
      </i> 441 U.S. 471 (1979);
                    <i>
       Auerbach v. Bennett,
      </i> 47 N.Y.2d 619, 419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d 994 (1979);
                    <i>
       Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado,
      </i> 430 A.2d 779 (Del. 1981);
                    <i>
       Aronson v. Lewis,
      </i> 473 A.2d 805 (Del. 1984). For the present it should be permitted to continue to develop. Moreover, this issue may be the subject of an amendment to the Model Act at a later date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       b. Should the method of calculating attorneys’ fees be specified?
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Courts are today scrutinizing plaintiffs’ fees more closely than they have in the past. This trend should be encouraged, and it was therefore concluded that the subject was not appropriate for statutory language at the present time. It is believed that
                    the problem is more acute with respect to plaintiffs’ fees recoverable under general principles of derivative litigation than it is under section 7.40(d).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
       c. Should there be a maximum limit on an individual’s liability?
      </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sums involved in claims of alleged wrongdoing by a corporation and its officers and directors are often extremely large when viewed in the light of the personal resources of even an affluent person. Claims for millions of dollars may create a high
                    leverage to settle, and the potential exposure to these claims is an undesirable deterrent to service on the board of directors, particularly by outside directors. The proposed Federal Securities Code imposes a limit on individual
                    liability resulting from certain violations of the Code and similar suggestions have also been made by others. On the other hand, where a director’s or officer’s conduct has proved to be wrongful and detrimental to the corporation,
                    he should clearly be required to disgorge the entire benefit, and it also may be appropriate to require him rather than the victimized corporation and shareholders to bear any other loss suffered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since no state has yet adopted a limitation of liability provision, and there is no experience with these provisions, it was thought inappropriate at the present time to discard the principle of unlimited liability.

                        The futility doctrine does not allow a shareholder to bring a claim directly. Rather, it simply allows a shareholder to bring a derivative claim without first making demand upon corporate management. Thus, this doctrine offered no support to plaintiff’s

                        Former G.S. 55-55(b) codified the prior case law of this and other jurisdictions that in order for an individual as a shareholder to bring suit against the directors of a corporation for breach of their duties to the corporation, he must show that he
                        has exhausted his intracorporate remedies by making demand upon the board to do that which he seeks to have done. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2346 (1978).

                    <p>
                        In the absence of circumstances indicating that such a step would be futile, a demand that the directors act is a prerequisite of a shareholder suing upon behalf of the corporation. Roney v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite>                        81, 356 S.E.2d 401, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2663 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Exhaustion of intracorporate remedies (that is, “demand”) is a procedural prerequisite to the filing of a derivative action in this State. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323, 1987 N.C. LEXIS
                        2299 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minutes of board of directors meeting introduced into evidence by plaintiff confirmed that plaintiff made a motion that the corporation retain counsel to investigate the usurpation of a commercial leasing deal, and that this motion died for lack of a
                        second. This action satisfied the demand requirement of this section, and any further demand would have been futile. Silverman v. Miller, 155 B.R. 362, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 741 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An equitable exception to the demand requirement may be invoked when the directors who are in control of the corporation are the same ones (or under the control of the same ones) as were initially responsible for the breaches of duty alleged; in such
                        a case, the demand of a shareholder upon the directors to sue themselves or their principals would be futile and therefore is not required for the maintenance of the action. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite>                        77, 250 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2346 (1978); Alford v.

                        Mere negligence of the directors in evaluation of a purchase or in relying upon the advice of accounting and investment experts does not excuse a shareholder from demanding action by the board of directors before suing to enforce a corporate right. Roney

                        The business judgment rule, stated simply, provides that when a corporation’s decision not to assert a claim represents a good faith business judgment by its directors, a shareholder will not be permitted to substitute his judgment for that of the company’s

                        The defense of business judgment is not available to the corporation in a derivative action where a majority of its directors are implicated in the allegations of the suit, as it is a defense on the merits which may properly be interposed only by the

        Recommendation of Special Litigation Committee. —

                    <p>
                        To rely blindly on the report of a corporation-appointed special litigation committee is to abdicate the judicial duty to consider the interests of shareholders imposed by statute; this abdication is particularly inappropriate in a case where shareholders
                        allege serious breaches of fiduciary duties owed to them by the directors controlling the corporation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2299 (1987).

                    <p>
                        The fact that a special litigation committee appointed by directors charged with self-dealing recommends that derivative action should not proceed, while carrying weight, is not binding upon the trial court; rather, the court must make a fair assessment
                        of the report of the special committee, along with all the other facts and circumstances in the case, in order to determine whether the defendants will be able to show that the transaction complained of was just and reasonable
                        to the corporation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2299 (1987).

                        The burden is on the movant, usually the corporation on whose behalf the suit was initiated, to prove the independence, disinterestedness, and appropriate qualifications of the committee and that it conducted a reasonable investigation in good faith of
                        the matters alleged in the complaint. The committee is not entitled to a presumption of independence, disinterestedness, good faith, or reasonableness. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>,

                        In some situations, the corporation in whose interest the derivative action is purportedly brought will have interests adverse to those of the nominal plaintiffs bringing the action derivatively, and will of necessity be more than a nominal defendant.

                        In an action brought by a minority shareholder derivatively in the name and right of a corporation, to enforce rights or to seek redress accruing to the corporation, that corporation will be deemed for purposes of the litigation to be aligned as a party
                        plaintiff (except to the extent that the corporation is an actual defendant as to an issue in the action) although for purposes of form it is designated as a nominal defendant. Accordingly, the corporation may not defend itself
                        against the derivative action on the merits and must limit its defenses, if any, to the pre-trial matters proper to it. Where a corporation seeks to extend its defenses beyond those areas in which it may properly conduct them,
                        dismissal will lie against it. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2346 (1978).

                        In an action challenging the appointment of operating receivers for a corporation, there was no merit to defendants’ contention that the initial order of the trial court appointing the receivers was void because certain shareholders were not given notice
                        of the proceedings and were thereby denied their due process rights to notice prior to a court proceeding, the outcome of which would affect their property interests, since there was no requirement in the statutes, either in the

                        The statute sets forth two distinct standards for awarding attorneys’ fees to successful litigants and taxing unsuccessful litigants with their opponents’ attorney’s fees. The court may award attorney’s fees to a successful litigant who obtains a compromise
                        and settlement or judgment, and may also assess attorney’s fees against an unsuccessful litigant in certain cases. Lowder ex rel. Doby v. Doby, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 340 S.E.2d 487,

                        The plain language of the statute requires thorough judicial review of suits initiated by shareholders on behalf of a corporation. The court is directed to determine whether the interest of any shareholder will be substantially affected by the discontinuance,
                        dismissal, compromise, or settlement of a derivative suit. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2299 (1987).

                        Although the statute does not specify what test the court must apply in making its determination, it would be difficult for the court to determine whether the interests of shareholders or creditors would be substantially affected by such discontinuance,
                        dismissal, compromise, or settlement without looking at the proposed action substantively; the court must of necessity evaluate the adequacy of materials prepared by the corporation which support the corporation’s decision to settle
                        or dismiss a derivative suit, along with the plaintiff’s forecast of evidence. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2299 (1987).

                        The trial court is to undertake a two-step review of motions brought under former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section). First, it is to decide whether the proposal for disposition of the case which is submitted to the court was reached by qualified independent
                        disinterested decision-makers who in good faith proceeded to thoroughly investigate and evaluate the claims set forth in the complaint. The second step requires the trial court to exercise its own independent business judgment

                        on alleged accounting errors, and the committee made a good faith decision that the lawsuit was not in the best interests of the corporation since there was no evidence supporting the shareholder’s claims, and damages were questionable

                <p>
                    Section 8.01 requires that every corporation have a board of directors except that a corporation with 50 or fewer shareholders may dispense with or limit the authority of the board of directors by describing in the articles “who will perform some or all
                    of the duties of a board of directors.” Section 8.01(c). This election is independent of the various close corporation elections permitted by the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement, though the basic standard of 50 shareholders
                    is the same in both section 8.01 and that Supplement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, some form of governance is necessary for every corporation. The board of directors is the traditional form of corporate governance but it need not be the exclusive form. Patterns of management may be tailored to specific needs in connection
                    with family controlled enterprises, wholly or partially owned subsidiaries, or corporate joint ventures without the requirement of electing close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement. The persons
                    who perform some or all of the duties of the board of directors may be designated “trustees,” “agents,” or “managers,” and they may be selected in ways other than the traditional election by the shareholders. It is necessary, however,
                    that some person or group perform these duties, and the designated persons, while performing them, are subject to the same duties as directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of the restructuring of the traditional board of directors permitted by section 8.01 is presented by the facts of
                    <i>
       Lehrman v. Cohen,
      </i> 43 Del. Ch. 222, 222 A.2d 800 (Del. 1966), where two shareholders (or allied family interests) had equal voting power and wished to permit the corporation’s attorney to cast a tie-breaking vote on the board of directors
                    without giving him a participating equity interest in the corporation. While the desired result was successfully achieved in that case by creating a class of voting shares without a significant economic interest in the corporation,
                    the same result may be reached under section 8.01 directly by provision in the articles of incorporation without creating a special class of shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any arrangement under section 8.01(c) may also be established by a close corporation election under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a corporation has more than 50 shareholders, it must adopt the traditional board of directors as its sole form of governance. Because questions may at least theoretically arise how joint share ownership and other arrangements should be counted in
                    applying a numerical limitation, section 1.42 prescribes rules for calculating the number of shareholders for the purpose of this and other numerical limitations in the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.01(b) states that if a corporation has a board of directors “all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of,” the board of directors. The quoted
                    language is chosen to reflect the role and functions of boards of directors in all varieties of corporations. In a small corporation and in some larger corporations where the board of directors is composed entirely of persons actively
                    involved in the management of the corporate business, it may be reasonable to describe management as being “by” the board of directors. But a different model is appropriate for the boards of directors of publicly held corporations,
                    which usually include individuals not actively involved in management. In these corporations it is not feasible to impose a requirement that the business and affairs of the corporation be managed “by” the board of directors. In these
                    corporations the appropriate model is that the business and affairs be managed “under the direction of” the board of directors, since the role of the board of directors consist principally of the formulation of major management policy
                    with little or no direct involvement in day-to-day management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a correlative in large and complex publicly held corporations it is generally recognized that the board of directors may delegate to appropriate officers those powers not required by law to be exercised by the board of directors itself. Although delegation
                    does not relieve the board of directors from its responsibilities of oversight, directors should not be held personally responsible for actions or omissions of officers, employees, or agents of the corporation so long as the directors
                    have relied reasonably upon these officers, employees, or agents. See section 8.30 and its Official Comment. The board of directors has the power to probe to any depth its chooses in day-to-day management, but it has the responsibility
                    to do so only to the extent that section 8.30 requires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.01(b) also recognizes that the powers of the board of directors may be limited by express provisions in the articles of incorporation.

                <p>
                    This section contains several variations from former G.S. 55-24 and former G.S. 55-73. First, it requires that the board
                    <i>
       direct
      </i> the management of the business and affairs of the corporation whereas former G.S. 55-24 required that the board
                    <i>
       manage
      </i> the corporation’s business and affairs. As pointed out in the Official Comment, the new language clarifies the role of directors as policy makers rather than managers. Also, this section clarifies that all shareholders must
                    assent to an agreement (not contained in the articles of incorporation) which limits or dispenses with the board; and it explicitly provides that those in whom the board’s authority is vested under such an arrangement are deemed to
                    be acting as the board for all purposes of this Act (including the duties defined in G.S. 55-8-30 et seq.). Such substitutes for the board would be subject to liability to the same extent as directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act in permitting limitation of the board’s authority in a shareholders’ agreement as well as in the articles of incorporation, and it permits dispensing with or limiting the board of a corporation regardless of the
                    number of shareholders. Any such arrangement accomplished through a shareholders’ agreement must comply with G.S. 55-7-31(b). The second clause of subsection (c) relating to rights of third parties without knowledge does not appear
                    in the Model Act; it brings forward former G.S. 55-24(b). Finally, paragraph (d) does not appear in the Model Act, although it is likely that the same result would be reached under the Model Act.

                    Former G.S. 55-33, which provided for jurisdiction over nonresident directors, was not brought forward because G.S. 1-75.4, the general jurisdiction statute, specifically provides such jurisdiction. It was therefore deemed unnecessary to continue to include
                    a special provision in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>.

                        Directors are not, as a rule, responsible for mere errors of judgment, nor for slight omissions from which the loss complained of could not have been reasonably expected; but where they accept these positions of trust they are expected and required to
                        give them the care and attention that a prudent man should exercise in like circumstances, and are charged with a like duty, usually the care that a prudent man shows in the conduct of his own affairs of a similar kind. Besseliew

                        The promoters of a corporation occupy a relation of trust and confidence towards the corporation which they are calling into existence as well as to each other, and the law requires of them the same good faith it exacts from directors and other fiduciaries.

                    The elimination of mandatory special qualifications for directors is now nearly universal. The articles of incorporation or bylaws, however, may prescribe special qualifications, an option that is most likely to be utilized in closely held corporations
                    where qualifications for directors may be used as a device for ensuring representation and voting power on the board of directors.

                    Section 8.03(a) provides that the size of the initial board of directors may be “specified in or fixed in accordance with” the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The size of the board of directors may thus be fixed initially in the fundamental corporate
                    documents, or the decision as to the size of the initial board of directors may be made thereafter by those authorized in those documents. After shares have been issued, however, the power to increase or decrease the size of the board
                    of directors by more than 30 percent, whether by amendment of the bylaws or otherwise, is reserved to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before 1969 the Model Act required a board of directors to consist of at least three directors. Since then, however, the Model Act, and the corporation statutes of an increasing number of states, have provided that the board of directors may consist of
                    one or more members. A board of directors consisting of one or more individuals may be appropriate for corporations with one or two shareholders, or for corporations with more than two shareholders where in fact the full power of management
                    is vested in only one or two persons. The requirement that every corporation have a board of directors of at least three directors may require the introduction into these closely held corporations of persons with no financial interest
                    in the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.03(b) and (c) prescribe rules for corporations in which the board of directors has authority to establish or change the size of the board of directors. It has no application to corporations in which the size of the board of directors is fixed
                    by the bylaws and the shareholders reserve to themselves the power to amend bylaws. See section 10.20. The basic premise is that the determination of the size of the board of directors should rest with the shareholders. These subsections
                    also prevent the board of directors from manipulating its own size without the approval of the shareholders. But experience has shown, particularly in larger corporations, that it is desirable to grant the board of directors some authority
                    to change its size without incurring the expense of obtaining shareholder approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (b) therefore permits the board of directors to increase or decrease its own size by up to 30 percent without shareholder approval. The 30 percent is calculated from the size last approved by the shareholders, thereby preventing directors from
                    tacking a series of 30 percent increases or decreases to alter the basic composition of a board of directors without shareholder approval. For example, in a board of directors fixed or approved by the shareholders at 15 members, the
                    board may, without shareholder approval, change the size of the board to as few as 11 or as many as 19; a board of 5 may be changed by the board to as few as 4 or as many as 6. The 30-percent limit was established to give the board
                    of directors reasonable leeway in adjusting its own size. Thus, when a director resigns, the board of directors should normally be able to reduce its own size and elect not to fill the vacancy without shareholder action; similarly,
                    if an exceptionally qualified person becomes available (or is invited to serve on the board of directors because of a felt need), he may normally be added to the board of directors without shareholder approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, subsection (c) authorizes the articles of incorporation or bylaws to establish a variable-range size for the board of directors. If a variable range size is established, either the shareholders or the board of directors may prescribe or
                    change the size of the board of directors within that range. However, only the shareholders may amend the bylaws to change the limits established for the size of the board of directors, or to change from a variable-range size board
                    to a fixed board or vice versa. A variable-range size board is intended to provide essentially the same benefits as the authority granted a board of directors by subsection (b) to change its own size by 30 percent. Many publicly held
                    corporations have established variable-range size boards of directors pursuant to general authority in state statutes. Specific recognition and regulation of this widespread practice seems desirable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.03(c) also applies to a variable-range size board of directors whose initial size is established by the articles of incorporation if the articles authorize changing the limits of the size of the board without having to amend the articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The limitations on the authority of the board of directors set forth in this section are substantive restrictions that may not be changed by provisions in articles of incorporation or bylaws. For example, a general provision in bylaws granting the board
                    of directors authority to amend bylaws does not authorize a board of directors, after shares are issued, to change the limits of a variable-range board established by the bylaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 8.03(b) and (c) are primarily designed for publicly held corporations. In closely held corporations, typically, a change in the size of the board of directors may be accomplished readily by the shareholders if that is desired. In many closely
                    held corporations, on the other hand, a board of directors of a fixed size may be an essential part of a control arrangement. In these situations, an increase or decrease in the size of the board of directors by even a single member
                    may significantly affect control. In order to effectuate control arrangements dependent on a board of directors of a fixed size, the power of the board of directors to change its own size must be negated. This may be accomplished by
                    fixing the size of the board of directors in the articles of incorporation or by expressly negating all powers of the board of directors to change the size of the board, whether by amendment of the bylaws or otherwise. See section
                    10.22.

                    Section 8.03(d) makes it clear that all directors are elected annually unless the board is staggered. See section 8.05 and its Official Comment.

                    This section permits any corporation to have fewer than three directors, whereas former G.S. 55-25(a) permitted it only where there were fewer than three shareholders. In addition, unless there is cumulative voting, this section permits the board to change
                    the number of directors by up to 30% in a 12-month period, whereas former G.S. 55-25(b) required shareholder action or a provision in the articles of incorporation to change the number of directors except within a variable range. Finally,

                    Section 8.04 makes explicit that the articles of incorporation may provide that a specified number (or all) of the directors may be elected by the holders of one or more classes of shares. This approach is widely used in closely held corporations to effect
                    an agreed upon allocation of control, for example, to ensure minority representation on the board of directors by issuing to that minority a class of shares entitled to elect one or more directors. A class (or classes) of shares entitled
                    to elect separately one or more directors constitutes a separate voting group for purposes of the election of directors; within each voting group directors are elected by a plurality of votes and quorum and voting requirements must
                    be separately met by each voting group. See sections 7.25, 7.26, and 7.28.

                    Section 8.05(d) provides that the terms of all directors elected to fill vacancies expire at the next meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected. Thus, if terms are staggered under section 8.06, the term of a director elected to fill a vacant
                    term with more than a year to run is shorter than the term of his predecessor. The board of directors may take appropriate steps, by designation of short terms or otherwise, to return the rotation of election of directors to the original
                    terms established or fixed by the articles or bylaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.05(e) provides for “holdover” directors so that directorships do not automatically become vacant at the expiration of their terms but the same persons continue in office until successors qualify for office. Thus the power of the board of directors
                    to act continues uninterrupted even though an annual shareholders’ meeting is not held or the shareholders are deadlocked and unable to elect directors at the meeting.

    Staggered terms for directors.

                    The articles of incorporation or bylaws adopted by the shareholders may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two, three, or four groups, with each group containing one-half, one-third, or one-fourth
                    of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders’
                    meeting after their election, the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, and the terms of the fourth group, if any, expire at the fourth annual shareholders’ meeting
                    after their election. At each annual shareholders’ meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two, three, or four years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

                    Section 8.06 recognizes the practice of “classifying” the board or “staggering” the terms of directors so that only one-half or one-third of them are elected at each annual shareholders’ meeting and directors are elected for two- or three-year terms rather
                    than one-year terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 8.06 at least three directors must be elected at each annual meeting. These directors may be elected by one or more voting groups, as provided in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principal justification for staggering the board today is that it protects against sudden change in the management of the corporation despite a change in shareholdings. It also reduces the impact of cumulative voting since a greater number of votes
                    is required to elect a director if the board is staggered than is required if the entire board were elected at each annual meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The staggered board of directors is sometimes used by incumbent management to make unwanted takeover attempts more difficult to effectuate. It is unlikely to be effective alone, however, since the shareholders may in any event remove directors under section
                    8.08 whether or not their terms are staggered. As a result, a staggered board is likely to be used for this purpose only in conjunction with a provision that directors may be removed only for cause.

                    The resignation of a director is effective when the written notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date, in which case the director continues to serve until that later date. Since the person giving the notice is still a member
                    of the board, he may participate in all decisions until the specified date, including the choice of his successor under section 8.10. The participation of the retiring director in the decision on his successor may be of importance
                    in closely held corporations where control of the board may be affected by the resignation.

                    Vacancies created by a resignation effective at a later date may be filled before that date under section 8.10.

                    Section 8.08(a) accepts the view that since the shareholders are the owners of the corporation, they should normally have the power to change the directors at will. This section reverses the common law position that directors have a statutory entitlement
                    to their office and can be removed only for cause—fraud, criminal conduct, gross abuse of office amounting to a breach of trust, or similar conduct. The power to remove directors is subject to several restrictions set forth in section
                    8.08:

                        The power to remove a director without cause may be eliminated by a provision in the articles of incorporation. Such a provision in effect guarantees the directors the same entitlement to office that directors enjoyed at common law. It is likely to be
                        used in closely held corporations as an element of an agreed-upon allocation of power and control which ensures directors immunity from removal except for cause. It may also be used in publicly held corporations that fear changes
                        in ownership of the majority of the shares and desire to provide security to the directors.

                    (d) is new. Subsection (d) does not prohibit removal of a director by unanimous consent (
                    <i>
       see
      </i> G.S. 55-7-04) but requires notice if the removal is to be considered at a meeting. The language of the Model Act was modified in this subsection for clarity.

                    Section 8.09 authorizes the removal of a director who is found in a judicial proceeding to have engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct or gross abuse of office. For example, a judicial proceeding (as contrasted with removal under section 8.08) may
                    be necessary or appropriate in the following situations:
                </p>

                        In a closely held corporation, the director charged with misconduct is elected by voting group or cumulative voting, and the shareholders with power to prevent his removal exercise that power despite the existence of fraudulent or dishonest conduct. The
                        classic example is where the director charged with misconduct himself possesses sufficient votes to prevent his own removal and exercises his voting power to that end.

                        In a publicly held corporation, the director charged with misconduct declines to resign, though urged to do so, and because of the large number of widely scattered shareholders, a special shareholders’ meeting can be held only after a period of delay
                        and at considerable expense.

                    A shareholder who owns less than 10 percent of the outstanding shares of the corporation may bring suit derivatively in the name of the corporation under this section upon compliance with the requirements of section 7.40. A shareholder who owns at least
                    10 percent of the outstanding shares of the corporation may maintain suit in his own name and in his own right without compliance with section 7.40. The corporation, however, must be made a party to the proceeding. See section 8.09(c).

                    The purpose of section 8.09 is to permit the prompt and efficient elimination of dishonest directors. It is not intended to permit judicial resolution of internal corporate struggles for control except in those cases in which a court finds that the director
                    has been guilty of wrongful conduct of the type described.

                <p>
                    Vacancies on the board of directors may be filled either by the shareholders or by the board of directors. In large corporations the cost of calling a special meeting of shareholders may be prohibitive so that in those corporations filling vacancies by
                    the board of directors is the norm. On the other hand, in a closely held corporation the shareholders may fill vacancies as readily as the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.10(a)(3) allows the directors remaining in office to fill vacancies even though they are fewer than a quorum. The test for the exercise of this power is whether the directors remaining in office are fewer than a quorum, not whether the directors
                    seeking to act are fewer than a quorum. For example, on a board of six directors where a quorum is four, if there are two vacancies, they may not be filled under section 8.10(a)(3) at a “meeting” attended by only three directors. Even
                    though the three directors are fewer than a quorum, section 8.10(a)(3) is not applicable because the number of directors remaining in office—four—is not fewer than a quorum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.10(b) provides that if a voting group of shares is entitled to elect a director, only that voting group is entitled to fill a vacant office which was held by a director elected by that voting group. This section is part of the consistent treatment
                    of directors elected by a voting group of shareholders. See sections 1.40, 7.25, 7.26, 7.28, 8.04 and 8.08(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.10(c) permits vacancies that will arise on a specific later date to be filled in advance of that date so long as the designee does not actually take office until the vacancy occurs. The director in the office that will become vacant may participate
                    in the selection of his successor. A vacancy arising at a later date is most likely to arise because of a resignation effective at a later date; it may also arise in connection with retirements or with prospective amendments to bylaws.
                    In a closely held corporation with a balance of power on the board of directors that was reached by agreement, a prospective resignation followed by the appointment of a successor under this section permits the board to act on the
                    replacement before the change in balance caused by the resignation.

                    This section is generally consistent with prior law. However, unlike the present section, former G.S. 55-27(c) permitted the bylaws as well as the articles of incorporation to withhold from directors the power to fill board vacancies and did not permit
                    the directors to fill vacancies created by an increase in the authorized number of directors, except within a minimum-maximum range fixed by the shareholders.

                <p>
                    This section expands the comparable Model Act section in subsection (a) by explicitly recognizing a vacancy occurring from failure by the shareholders to elect a full board and in subsection (b) by permitting the remaining directors elected by a voting
                    group to fill a vacancy in that class of directors, both of which are consistent with former G.S. 55-27(c). The Model Act was modified in subsection (c) to conform to the changes made in G.S. 55-8-07(b) regarding the effective date
                    of a resignation.

                    Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors, without regard to personal interest, may fix the compensation of directors for services in any capacity as a director. The compensation established pursuant to this
                    section of directors of a public corporation or of a corporation that so provides in its articles of incorporation is presumed to be fair to the corporation unless proven not to be fair to the corporation by a preponderance of the

                    This section puts at rest the question whether the board of directors can fix the compensation of its members for serving as directors. The practice of compensating directors is now of long standing, and the establishment of a policy with respect to director
                    compensation is an appropriate function of the board of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In publicly held corporations, compensation is customarily provided to nonmanagement directors. As stated in
                    <i>
       The Corporate Director’s Guidebook,
      </i> “. . . it is expected that a nonmanagement director will devote substantial attention to the affairs of the corporation and will be compensated accordingly.” 33 BUS. LAW. 1591, 1622 (1978).

                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act by confirming that, in the case of a public corporation or of a private corporation that so provides in its articles of incorporation, if the board of directors fixes the compensation of directors, then regardless
                    of their personal interest in that decision, the amount of compensation is presumed fair to the corporation and the challenger would be required to allege facts, that if proven true, would be sufficient to overcome the presumption
                    in order to avoid dismissal at the summary judgment stage of any proceeding. In effect, the section confirms that the decision of a board regarding its compensation is subject to review under the business judgment rule, but the amendment
                    does not preclude meritorious challenges where a board of directors has awarded itself compensation that is proven not to be fair to the corporation.

                    This section authorizes meetings of directors anywhere. No distinction is made between meetings in-state and out-of-state. It also authorizes the board of directors to permit any or all directors to participate in a meeting by the use of any means of
                    communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other. This decision is discretionary with the board of directors, and a person participating in this fashion is deemed to be present in person at the
                    meeting for purposes of quorum and voting requirements.

                    With the development of modern electronic technology, it is possible that the advantages of the traditional meeting, at which all members are present at a single place, may be obtained even though the members are physically dispersed and no two directors
                    are present at the same place. The advantage of the traditional meeting is the opportunity for interchange that is permitted by a meeting in a single room at which members are physically present. If this opportunity for interchange
                    is thought to be available by the board of directors, a meeting may be conducted by electronic means although no two directors are physically present at the same place and no specific place for the meeting is designated.

                    By providing that, in the absence of contrary provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, “the board of directors may permit” telephonic participation in its meetings, this section resolves the ambiguity of former G.S. 55-29(c), which provided
                    that a director “may participate” telephonically in such meetings. It is now clear that an individual director may not assert telephonic participation as a right.

                    The power of the board of directors to act unanimously without a meeting is based on the pragmatic consideration that in many situations a formal meeting is a waste of time. For example, in a closely held corporation there will often be informal discussion
                    by the manager-owners of the venture before a decision is made. And, of course, if there is only a single director (as is permitted by section 8.03), a written consent is the natural method of signifying director action. Consent may
                    be signified on one or more documents if desirable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In publicly held corporations, formal meetings of the board of directors may be appropriate for many actions. But there will always be situations where prompt action is necessary and the decision noncontroversial, so that approval without a formal meeting
                    may be appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 8.21 the requirement of unanimous consent precludes the possibility of stifling or ignoring opposing argument. A director opposed to an action that is proposed to be taken by unanimous consent, or uncertain about the desirability of that
                    action, may compel the holding of a directors’ meeting to discuss the matter simply by withholding his consent.

                    This section is generally consistent with former G.S. 55-29, except that it does not contain the provisions for estoppel of a director who does not object promptly after obtaining knowledge of the action. The drafters believed that little, if any, use
                    was made of the estoppel provisions of former G.S. 55-29(a)(3).

                    Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice and special meetings require only two days’ notice unless other requirements are imposed by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The notice may be written or oral. Also, no statement
                    of the purpose of either a regular or special meeting is necessary unless required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. These requirements differ from the requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders because of fundamental
                    differences in their roles: directors are expected to be more closely involved in corporate affairs than shareholders, and meetings of directors are held more systematically and regularly than meetings of shareholders.

                    Section 8.23(a) reverses the common law rule that invalidates waivers of notice by directors after the date and time of the meeting. In modern practice notice is often a technical requirement and waivers should be freely permitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.23(b) recognizes that the function of notice is to inform directors of a meeting. If a director actually appears at the meeting he has probably had notice of it and generally should not be able to raise a technical objection that he was not
                    given notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In cases where actual prejudice occurs because of the lack of notice, as may be indicated by the absence of one or more other directors, the director must call attention to the defect at the outset of the meeting or promptly upon his arrival. That director,
                    or a director who did not receive notice and was not present at the meeting, may then attack the validity of the action taken for want of notice. If a director properly objects to the meeting being held, he is not presumed to have
                    assented to actions taken thereafter, but he waives his objection if he there after votes for or assents to action taken at the meeting. See section 8.24(d).

       Official Comment to the Model Business Corporation Act, 2016 Revision
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the absence of a provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a quorum is a majority of the total number of directors specified (
                    <i>
       e.g.,
      </i> “the number of directors shall be X”) in or fixed (
                    <i>
       e.g.,
      </i> “the number of directors shall be not less than Y or more than Z as determined by the board of directors”) in accordance with the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.24(a) recognizes that the Act itself may provide for a different quorum in certain specified situations. See sections 8.53(c)(1) and 8.55(b)(1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.24 allows the articles of incorporation or bylaws to decrease the required quorum (but not below one-third) or to increase the quorum or the vote necessary to take action up to and including unanimity. The articles of incorporation or bylaws
                    may also establish quorum or voting requirements with respect to directors elected by voting groups of shareholders pursuant to section 8.04. The options to increase the quorum and vote requirements might be used, for example, in closely
                    held corporations where a greater degree of participation is thought appropriate or where a minority participant in the venture seeks to obtain a veto power over corporate action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase “when the vote is taken” in section 8.24(c) is designed to make clear that the board of directors may act only when a quorum is present. If directors leave during the course of a meeting, the board of directors may not act after the number
                    of directors present is reduced to less than a quorum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a director who is present at a meeting wishes to object or abstain with respect to action taken by the board of directors or a committee, that director must make his or her position clear in one of the ways described in section 8.24(d). If objection
                    is made in the form of a written dissent under clause (iii) of section 8.24(d), it may be transmitted by any form of delivery authorized by the definition of that term in section 1.40, including electronic transmission, if authorized
                    by section 1.41. Section 8.24(d) serves the important purpose of bringing the position of the dissenting director clearly to the attention of the other directors. The provision that a director who is present is deemed to have assented
                    unless an objection is noted also prevents a director from later seeking to avoid responsibility because of unexpressed doubts about the wisdom of the action taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.24(d) applies only to directors who are present at the meeting. Directors who are not present are not deemed to have assented to any action taken at the meeting in their absence.

                <p>
                    This section is generally consistent with prior law but clarifies an ambiguity in former G.S. 55-28(d) by expressly requiring in subsection (c) that a quorum be present when the vote is taken, thus explicitly permitting directors to prevent further action
                    by withdrawing from the meeting to eliminate a quorum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section varies from the Model Act in requiring in subsection (b) that a bylaw fixing a low quorum be “adopted by the shareholders.” For clarification, the word “files” was substituted in subdivision (d) (3) for the Model Act’s ambiguous “delivers.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2021-106, s. 3(a) includes amendments to conform to changes to the Model Act that clarify provisions regarding quorum and voting requirements applicable to the board of directors. The changes eliminate the use of the terms “fixed board size”
                    and “variable-range size board,” and substitute a clearer formulation, in which the denominator for quorum and voting purposes would be the number of directors “specified in or fixed in accordance with the articles of incorporation
                    or bylaws.” The changes also address an apparent inconsistency that previously existed between G.S. 55-8-24(a), which provided that a quorum consists of a majority of the number of directors unless the articles of incorporation or
                    bylaws require a greater number, and G.S. 55-8-24(b), which limited the articles of incorporation or bylaws from establishing a quorum to be no fewer than one-third of the number of directors. The amendments to G.S. 55-8-24(a) clarify
                    that the articles of incorporation or the bylaws may establish a quorum greater than or lesser than the statutory presumption of a majority of the number of directors, while G.S. 55-8-24(b) provides that the minimum quorum that may
                    be set in the articles of incorporation or bylaws is one-third of the number of directors. The amendment to G.S. 55-8-24(a) also recognizes that other provisions of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, such as G.S. 55-8-55(b)(1),
                    provide for board of director actions to be taken by groups of directors that in number may not satisfy these quorum requirements. The change to G.S. 55-8-24(c) recognizes that certain provisions of the North Carolina Business Corporation
                    Act, such as G.S. 55-8-55(b)(1) and G.S. 55-9-04(c), specify different voting standards than the standard specified in G.S. 55-8-24(c).

                    Section 8.25 makes explicit the common law power of a board of directors to act through committees of directors and specifies the powers of the board of directors that are nondelegable, that is, powers that only the full board of directors may exercise.
                    Section 8.25 deals only with committees of the board of directors exercising the functions of the board of directors; the board of directors or management, independently of section 8.25, may establish nonboard committees composed of
                    directors, employees, or others to deal with corporate powers not required to be exercised by the board of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.25(b) provides that a committee of the board of directors may be created only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors then in office, or, if greater, by the number of directors required to take action by the articles
                    of incorporation or the bylaws. This supermajority requirement reflects the importance of the decision to invest board committees with power to act under section 8.25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Committees of the board of directors are assuming increasingly important roles in the governance of publicly held corporations. See “The Corporate Director’s Guidebook,” 33 BUS. LAW. 1591 (1978); “The Overview Committees of the Board of Directors,” 35
                    BUS. LAW. 1335 (1980). Executive committees have long provided guidance to management between meetings of the full board of directors. Audit committees also have a long history of performing essential review and control functions on
                    behalf of the board of directors. In recent years nominating and compensation committees, composed primarily or entirely of nonmanagement directors, have also become more widely used by publicly held corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.25 establishes the desirable and appropriate role of director committees in light of competing considerations: on the one hand, it seems clear that appropriate board committee action is not only desirable but also is likely to improve the functioning
                    of larger and more diffuse boards of directors; on the other hand, wholesale delegation of authority to a board committee, to the point of abdication of director responsibility as a board of directors, is manifestly inappropriate and
                    undesirable. Overbroad delegation also increase the potential, where the board of directors is divided, for usurpation of basic board functions by means of delegation to a committee dominated by one faction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The statement of nondelegable functions set out in section 8.25(e) is based on the principle that prohibitions against delegation should be limited generally to actions substantially affecting the rights of shareholders among themselves as shareholders
                    and specifically to (1) those matters that have immediate and irrevocable effect (such as the declaration of a dividend), (2) those matters that may well become irrevocable without swift action, and (3) those matters that will cause
                    changes of position by others that cannot be rectified. As a result, delegation of authority to committees under section 8.25(e) may be broader than mere authority to act with respect to matters arising within the ordinary course of
                    business. The ordinary course of business standard for delegation was rejected as being too narrow and inappropriate for many modern corporations. For example, although section 8.25(e)(8) makes nondelegable the decision whether to
                    issue and sell shares or create a class or series of shares with designated rights and preferences, it permits the board of directors to delegate to a committee (within limits specifically prescribed by the board of directors) the
                    important but more limited functions of fixing the specific terms—including without limitation, the price, the dividend rate, provisions for redemption, sinking fund, conversion, voting or preferential rights, and provisions for other
                    features of a class or series of shares. The committee may also be empowered to adopt any final resolution setting forth the terms and to authorize the appropriate filing with the Secretary of State required by this Act. Thus, terms
                    of the sale of shares may be set quickly and upon the most accurate information without necessarily involving a meeting of the board of directors. The phrase “(or senior executive officer of the corporation)” also permits these functions
                    to be delegated to the chief financial officer or other appropriate officer of the corporation. The subsection also permits delegation to a committee of authority to determine the terms of a contract or option for the sale of shares
                    if the board prescribes specific limits in a stock option plan or otherwise. This delegation avoids requiring involvement of the full board in the details of the administration of stock option or other compensation plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.25(e) prohibits delegation of authority with respect to most mergers, sales of substantially all the assets, amendments to articles of incorporation and voluntary dissolution under section 8.25(e)(2) since these require shareholder action. In
                    addition, section 8.25(e) prohibits delegation to a board committee of authority to declare dividends or distributions, designate director candidates for purposes of proxy solicitation, fill board vacancies, approve a so-called “short-form
                    merger” (where the interests of the minority shareholders warrant special attention), authorize the disposition or reacquisition of shares, or amend the bylaws or the articles of incorporation (without shareholder approval under section
                    10.02). On the other hand, under section 8.25(e) many actions of a material nature, such as the authorization of long-term debt and capital investment or the pricing of shares, may properly be made the subject of committee delegation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The statutes of several states make nondelegable certain powers not listed in section 8.25(e)—for example, the power to change the principal corporate office, to appoint or remove officers, to fix director compensation, or to remove agents. These are
                    not prohibited by section 8.25(e) since the whole board of directors may reverse or rescind the committee action taken, if it should wish to do so, without undue risk that implementation of the committee action might be irrevocable
                    or irreversible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.25(f) makes clear that although the board of directors may delegate to a committee the authority to take action, the designation of the committee, the delegation of authority to it, and action by the committee will not alone constitute compliance
                    by a noncommittee board member with his responsibility under section 8.30. On the other hand, a noncommittee director also will not automatically incur liability should the action of the particular committee fail to meet the standard
                    of care set out in section 8.30. The noncommittee member’s liability in these cases will depend upon whether he failed to comply with section 8.30(b)(3). Factors to be considered in this regard will include the care used in the delegation
                    to and supervision over the committee, and the amount of knowledge regarding the particular matter which the noncommittee director has available to him. Care in delegation and supervision include appraisal of the capabilities and diligence
                    of the committee directors in light of the subject and its relative importance and may be facilitated, in the usual case, by review of minutes and receipt of other reports concerning committee activities. The enumeration of these factors
                    is intended to emphasize that directors may not abdicate their responsibilities and secure exoneration from liability simply by delegating authority to board committees. Rather, a director against whom liability is asserted based upon
                    acts of a committee of which he is not a member avoids liability if the standards contained in section 8.30 are met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.25(f) has no application to a member of the committee itself. The standard applicable to a committee member is set forth in section 8.30(a).

                    The powers which may not be delegated to committees, specified in subsection (e) of this section, are different and more extensive than those specified in former G.S. 55-31(a). Also, this section contains no counterpart of former G.S. 55-31(c), which
                    expressly held the board responsible for action of its committees. This difference is moderated by subsection (f) of the present section.

                    The amendment to subsection (e)(1) affected by Session Law 2007-385 permits a board of directors to delegate to a committee the authority to authorize or approve distributions, but only according to a formula or method, or within limits, prescribed by
                    the board of directors. This applies to distributions as defined in G.S. 55-1-40, including but not limited to share reacquisitions and dividends.

                <p>
                    Subsection (a) provides that a board of directors may create committees and appoint one or more members of the board of directors to serve on the committees, but does not address the use of substitute committee members. The change in subsection (h), which
                    is based on Model Act (2016 Revision) Section 8.25(e), empowers board committees to continue operating despite a member’s absence or disqualification by allowing the full board to designate another board member who would be available
                    to act without delay in committee meetings if a regular committee member was disqualified or unable to be present at a committee meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless otherwise required by committee governing documents, replacement of an absent or disqualified member is not necessary to permit the other committee members to continue to perform their duties (provided that a quorum is present). Rather, appointing
                    alternate committee members in advance is intended as an expedient temporary solution, allowing a committee to continue effectively accomplishing its duties despite an absent or disqualified committee member and without necessity of
                    convening a special meeting of the full board to make a short-fuse replacement. The alternate director owes the same fiduciary duties and is subject to the same liabilities as any other director.

                        Section 8.26 is intended to clarify that a corporation can enter into an agreement, such as a merger agreement, containing a force the vote provision. Section 8.26 is broader than some analogous state corporation law provisions and applies to several
                        different provisions of the Model Act that require the directors to approve a matter before recommending that the shareholders vote to approve it. Under section 8.26, directors can agree to submit a matter to the shareholders for
                        approval even if they later determine that they no longer recommend it. The provision is not intended to relieve the board of directors of its duty to consider carefully the proposed transaction and the interests of the shareholders.

                <p>
                    Section 8.30 defines the general standard of conduct for directors. It sets forth the standard by focusing on the manner in which the director performs his duties, not the correctness of his decisions. Section 8.30(a) thus requires a director to perform
                    his duties in good faith, with the care of an ordinarily prudent person in a like position and in a manner he believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. This standard is based on former section 35 of the 1969 Model Act,
                    a number of state statutes and on judicial formulations of the duty of care applicable to directors. Section 8.30 also parallels, to the extent possible, the indemnification provisions of sections 8.50 through 8.58.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In determining whether to impose liability, the courts recognize that boards of directors and corporate managers continuously make decisions that involve the balancing of risks and benefits for the enterprise. Although some decisions turn out to be unwise
                    or the result of a mistake of judgment, it is unreasonable to reexamine these decisions with the benefit of hindsight. Therefore, a director is not liable for injury or damage caused by his decision, no matter how unwise or mistaken
                    it may turn out to be, if in performing his duties he met the requirements of section 8.30.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even before statutory formulations of directors’ duty of care, courts sometimes invoked the business judgment rule in determining whether to impose liability in a particular case. In doing so, courts have sometimes used language similar to the standards
                    set forth in section 8.30(a). The elements of the business judgment rule and the circumstances for its application are continuing to be developed by the courts. In view of that continuing judicial development, section 8.30 does not
                    try to codify the business judgment rule or to delineate the differences, if any, between that rule and the standards of director conduct set forth in this section. That is a task left to the courts and possibly to later revisions
                    of this Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30 should be read in light of the basic duty of directors set forth in section 8.01(b) that the “business and affairs of a corporation [shall be] managed under the direction of” the board. Since the board may delegate or assign to appropriate
                    officers of the corporation the authority or duty to exercise powers that section 8.01 does not require the board to retain, directors are not personally responsible under section 8.30 for actions or omissions of officers, employees,
                    or agents of the corporation so long as the directors, complying with the standard of care set forth in section 8.30, have acted reasonably in delegating responsibility.

                <p>
                    Section 8.30(a) establishes a general standard of care for all directors. It requires a director to exercise “the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise.” Some state statutes use the words “diligence,” “care,” and “skill”
                    to define this duty. E.G., N.C. GEN. STAT. ANN. § 55-35 (1975). There is very little authority as to what “skill” and “diligence,” as distinguished from “care,” can be required or properly expected of corporate directors in the performance
                    of their duties. “Skill,” in the sense of technical competence in a particular field, should not be a qualification for the office of director. The concept of “diligence” is sufficiently subsumed within the concept of “care.” Accordingly,
                    the words “diligence” and “skill” were omitted from the standard adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, section 8.30 does not use the term “fiduciary” in the standard for directors’ conduct, because that term could be confused with the unique attributes and obligations of a fiduciary imposed by the law of trusts, some of which are not appropriate
                    for directors of a corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several of the phrases chosen to define the general standard of care in section 8.30(a) deserve specific mention.

                    <li id="t55a08p03s55-8-30ol31">
                        The reference to “ordinarily prudent person” embodies long traditions of the common law, in contrast to suggested standards that might call for some undefined degree of expertise, like “ordinarily prudent businessman.” The phrase recognizes the need for
                        innovation, essential to profit orientation, and focuses on the basic director attributes of common sense, practical wisdom, and informed judgment.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t55a08p03s55-8-30ol32">
                        The phrase “in a like position” recognizes that the “care” under consideration is that which would be used by the “ordinarily prudent person” if he were a director of the particular corporation.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t55a08p03s55-8-30ol33">
                        The combined phrase “in a like position . . . under similar circumstances” is intended to recognize that (a) the nature and extent of responsibilities will vary, depending upon such factors as the size, complexity, urgency, and location of activities
                        carried on by the particular corporation, (b) decisions must be made on the basis of the information known to the directors without the benefit of hindsight, and (c) the special background, qualifications, and management responsibilities
                        of a particular director may be relevant in evaluating his compliance with the standard of care. Even though the quoted phrase takes into account the special background, qualifications and management responsibilities of a particular
                        director, it does not excuse a director lacking business experience or particular expertise from exercising the common sense, practical wisdom, and informed judgment of an “ordinarily prudent person.”
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The process by which a director informs himself will vary but the duty of care requires every director to take steps to become informed about the background facts and circumstances before taking action on the matter at hand. In relying upon the performance
                    by management of delegated or assigned duties pursuant to section 8.01 (including, for example, matters of law and legal compliance), the director may depend upon the presumption of regularity, absent knowledge or notice to the contrary.
                    A director may also rely on information, opinions, reports, and statements prepared or presented by others as set forth in section 8.30(b). Furthermore, a director should not be expected to anticipate the problems which the corporation
                    may face except in those circumstances where something has occurred to make it obvious to the director that the corporation should be addressing a particular problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A director complying with the standards expressed in section 8.30(a) is entitled to rely upon information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, prepared or presented by the persons or committees described
                    in section 8.30(b). The right to rely under this section applies to the entire range of matters for which the board of directors is responsible. Under section 8.30(c), however, a director so relying must be without knowledge concerning
                    the matter in question that would cause his reliance to be unwarranted. Also inherent in the concept of good faith is the requirement that, in order to be entitled to rely on a report, statement, opinion, or other matter, the director
                    must have read the report or statement in question, or have been present at a meeting at which it was orally presented, or have taken other steps to become generally familiar with its contents. In short, the director must comply with
                    the general standard of care of section 8.30(a) in making a judgment as to the reliability and competence of the source of information upon which he proposes to rely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30(b) permits reliance upon outside advisers, including not only those in the professional disciplines customarily supervised by state authorities, such as lawyers, accountants, and engineers, but also those in other fields involving special
                    experience and skills, such as investment bankers, geologists, management consultants, actuaries, and real estate appraisers. The concept of “expert competence” in section 8.30(b)(2) embraces a wide variety of qualifications and is
                    not limited to the more precise and narrower recognition of experts under the Securities Act of 1933. In this respect section 8.30(b) goes beyond any existing state business corporation act, although several state statutes permit reliance
                    on reports of appraisers selected with reasonable care by the board of directors and deal with the scope and nature of corporate reports and records generally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30(b) permits reliance upon a committee of the board of directors when performing a supervisory or other functions in instances where neither the full board of directors nor the committee takes dispositive action. For example, there may be reliance
                    upon an investigation undertaken by a board committee and reported to the full board of directors, which forms the basis for action by the board of directors itself. Another example is reliance upon a committee of the board of directors,
                    such as a corporate audit committee, with respect to the ongoing role of oversight of the accounting and auditing functions of the corporation. In addition, where reliance upon information or materials prepared or presented by a board
                    committee is not involved, a director may properly rely on dispositive action by a board committee (of which he is not a member) empowered to act pursuant to authority delegated under section 8.25 or acting with the acquiescence of
                    the board of directors. In this connection, see the Official Comment to section 8.25. A director may similarly rely on committees not created under section 8.25 which have nondirector members.

                <p>
                    In conditioning reliance upon reasonable belief that the board committee merits the director’s “confidence,” section 8.30(b)(3) recognizes a difference between a board committee and an expert. In sections 8.30(b)(1) and (2) the reference is to “competence
                    of an expert,” which recognizes the expectation of experience and in most instances technical skills on the part of those upon whom the director may rely. In section 8.30(b)(3), the concept of “confidence” is substituted for “competence”
                    in order to avoid any inference that technical skills are a prerequisite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By identifying those upon whom a director may rely in discharging his duties, section 8.30(b) does not limit the ability of directors to delegate their powers under section 8.01(a) to committees of the board of directors or officers of the corporation,
                    except where this delegation is expressly prohibited by the Act. Delegation should be carried out in accordance with the standards set forth in section 8.30(a). See also section 8.25 and its Official Comment with respect to delegation
                    to committees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30(c) expressly prevents a director from “hiding his head in the sand” and relying on information, opinions, reports, or statements when he has actual knowledge which makes reliance unwarranted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30(d) follows former section 35 of the Model Act, which provided that “An individual who performs the duties of his office in accordance with this section is not liable for serving or having served as a director.” Thus, both former section 35
                    and current section 8.30(d) are self-executing, and the individual director’s exoneration from liability is automatic. If compliance with the standard of conduct set forth in former section 35 or section 8.30 is established, there
                    is no need to consider possible application of the business judgment rule. The possible application of the business judgment rule need only be considered if compliance with the standard of conduct set forth in former section 35 or
                    section 8.30 is not established.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.30(d) makes clear that the section will apply whether or not affirmative action was in fact taken. If the board of directors or a committee considers an issue (such as a recommendation of independent auditors concerning the corporation’s internal
                    accounting controls) and determines not to take action, the determination not to act is protected by section 8.30. Similarly, if the board of directors or committee delegates responsibility for handling a matter to subordinates, the
                    delegation constitutes “action” under section 8.30. Section 8.30(d) applies (assuming its requirements are satisfied) to any conscious consideration of matters involving the affairs of the corporation. It also applies to the determination
                    by the board of directors of which matters to address and which not to address. Section 8.30(d) does not apply only when the director has failed to consider taking action which under the circumstances he is obliged to consider taking.

                <p>
                    Although the word “fiduciary” is no longer used in describing the duty owed by a director to a corporation, there is no intent to change North Carolina law in this area. The decision not to bring forward the language stating that a director shall “be
                    deemed to stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation” in former G.S. 55-35 is not intended to modify in any way the duty of directors recognized under the former law. Removal of the word “fiduciary” was solely because of confusion
                    in other jurisdictions between the corporate and the trust standards of fiduciary duty. This Act does not attempt to define the full range of a director’s duty, since the language chosen might be used to limit the standards under which
                    directors should act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Former G.S. 55-35 provided that officers and directors stand in a fiduciary relation “to the corporation and to its shareholders.” The drafters decided not to bring forward the words “and to its shareholders” in order to avoid an interpretation that there
                    is a duty running directly from directors to the shareholders that would give shareholders a direct right of action on claims that should be asserted derivatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drafters noted the dictum in
                    <i>
    Snyder v. Freeman
   </i> , <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 204</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 593 (1980), suggesting that directors owe a fiduciary duty to creditors. The drafters considered adding a new section 55-8-34 expressly stating that the directors do not
                    have any such duty to creditors; but, because of the complexities and novelty of such a provision, they finally decided not to add the new section but instead to express in this Comment their opinion that in general no such duty exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (c) of this section is different from the Model Act in two respects. First, it requires “actual” knowledge for a director to be denied the right of reliance under subsection (b); and, second, it says more specifically that a director who has
                    such knowledge is not “entitled to the benefit of subsection (b)” instead of saying that such director is not “acting in good faith.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (e) of the section was added to the Model Act’s provisions to clarify the two points covered. It should be noted that a provision in the articles of incorporation that limits a director’s monetary liability for a breach of the duty of due care
                    does not affect the duty of due care itself.

                        A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director’s interest

                    Historically, the scope of a director’s duty of loyalty to a corporation has been defined by judicial decision rather than by statute. The courts have developed and refined this duty based on increasing sophistication and experience with the corporate
                    form, and the need to encourage honest decisions by directors and to discourage direct or indirect devices by which directors may benefit personally at the expense of creditors or shareholders. Over the years, courts have been vigilant
                    to subject novel transactions and devices to scrutiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 8.31 and 8.32 deal with various facets of the duty of loyalty. The Model Act, however, does not attempt to define the full range of this duty. Indeed, any such attempt would probably be self-defeating since the language chosen might be used to
                    limit prematurely the standards under which directors should act.

                    Section 8.31 deals only with “conflict of interest” transactions by a director with the corporation, that its, transactions in which the director has an interest either (1) directly or (2) indirectly through an entity in which the director has a financial
                    or managerial interest covered by section 8.31(b). A conflict of interest transaction does not include transactions in which the director participates in the transaction only as a shareholder and receives only a proportionate share
                    of the advantage or benefit of the transaction. Section 8.31 deals only with conflict of interest transactions involving directors; it does not address analogous transactions entered into by officers, employees, or substantial or dominating
                    shareholders unless they are also directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.31 rejects the common law view that all conflict of interest transactions entered into by directors are automatically voidable at the option of the corporation without regard to the fairness of the transaction or the manner in which the transaction
                    was approved by the corporation. Section 8.31(a) makes any automatic rule of voidability inapplicable to transactions that are fair or that have been approved by directors or shareholders in the manner provided by the balance of section
                    8.31. The approval mechanisms set forth in section 8.31(c) and (d) relate only to the elimination of this automatic rule of voidability and do not address the manner in which the transactions must be approved under other sections of
                    this Act. This is made clear by the express limitations in sections 8.31(c) and (d) that they are applicable only “for the purposes of this section” as well as the language of the second and third sentences of section 8.31(d).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The elimination of the automatic rule of voidability does not mean that all transactions that meet one or more of the tests set forth in section 8.31(a) are automatically valid. These transactions may be subject to attack on a variety of grounds independent
                    of section 8.31—for example, that the transaction constituted waste, that it was not authorized by the appropriate corporate body, that it violated other sections of the Model Business Corporation Act, or that it was unenforceable
                    under other common law principles. The sole purpose of section 8.31 is to sharply limit the common law principle of automatic voidability and in this respect section 8.31 follows earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of
                    many states dealing with conflict of interest transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 8.31(c) and (d) provide special rules for determining whether the board of directors (or a committee thereof) or the shareholders have authorized, approved, or ratified a conflict of interest transaction so as to bring subsections (a)(1) or (a)(2)
                    into play. Basically, these subsections require the transaction in question to be approved by an absolute majority of the directors (on the board of directors, or on the committee, as the case may be) or shares whose votes may be counted
                    in determining whether the transaction should be authorized, approved, or ratified. If these votes are not obtained the transaction is tested under the fairness test of subsection (a)(3). The vote required for authorization, approval,
                    or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction is more onerous than the standard applicable to normal voting requirements for approval of corporate actions—i.e., that a quorum be present and only the votes of directors or shares
                    present or represented at that meeting be considered—because of the importance of assuring that conflict of interest transactions receive as broad consideration within the corporation as possible if independent review on the basis
                    of fairness is to be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.31(c) provides that if a conflict of interest transaction is to be considered by the board of directors or a committee of the board, only the votes of directors “who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction” may be counted in determining
                    whether to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction. A vote mistakenly cast by an interested director, however, does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification by a committee or by the board of directors
                    under section 8.31 if it otherwise meets the requirement of this subsection. The presence of the interested director at the meeting similarly does not affect the validity of the action by the disinterested directors. Because of the
                    voting disqualification of interested directors, section 8.31(c) provides that a majority of the disinterested directors on the committee or on the board of directors, as the case may be, constitute a quorum for purposes of authorizing,
                    approving, or ratifying the conflict of interest transaction under section 8.31, subject always, however, to the requirement that more than one director must approve the transaction. This two director minimum is applicable to a committee
                    of the board of directors as well as the board of directors itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a director’s conflict of interest transaction is considered by the shareholders, section 8.31(d) applies a similar but somewhat more complex prohibition: votes by shares “owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect
                    interest in the transaction” and votes by shares “owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (b)(1)”—that is, an entity in which the director has a material financial interest or is a general partner—may
                    not be counted. This prohibition is based on the belief that the same considerations that prevent votes cast be interested directors from being counted in favor of a conflict of interest transaction also compel the conclusion that
                    votes cast by shares owned or controlled by them, or by entities involved in the transaction in which they have a material financial interest, should also not be counted when the issue is the authorization, approval, or ratification
                    of a conflict of interest transaction under section 8.31. A similar prohibition does not appear in section 41 of the 1969 Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some situations, the prohibition of section 8.31(d) will result in the conflict of interest issue being resolved by a majority of a minority of the shares. This will occur, for example, whenever a director who is the majority shareholder of the corporation
                    is interested in a transaction. The vote on the conflict of interest issue under section 8.31, however, must be distinguished from the vote on the approval of the transaction itself under other sections of the Model Act, in which there
                    is no prohibition against the voting of shares owned or controlled by an interested director. For example, if a parent corporation wishes to merge its 60-percent-owned subsidiary into itself, and the majority shareholder of the parent
                    is a director of the subsidiary, the votes of the shares owned by the parent corporation may not be counted under section 8.31(d) (since the shares are owned by an entity which is a party to the transaction and which the director controls).
                    The shares nevertheless may be voted on the merger proposal itself under chapter 11 of the Model Act, and the merger will, of course, normally be approved solely by the vote of the shares owned by the parent corporation. On the other
                    hand, the test of section 8.31(a)(2) is not met unless the transaction is approved by at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the 40 percent of the shares not owned by the parent corporation. If this requirement is
                    not met, the transaction may be evaluated under the fairness test of section 8.31(a)(3).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Indirect Conflicts of Interest
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.31 is applicable to “indirect” as well as direct conflicts; “indirect” is defined in section 8.31(b) to cover transactions between the corporation and an entity in which the director has a material financial interest or is a general partner.
                    Further, section 8.31(b) covers indirect conflicts where the director is an officer or director of another entity (but does not have a material financial interest in the transaction) if the transaction is of sufficient importance that
                    it is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation. The purpose of this last clause is to permit normal business transactions between large business entities that may have a common director to go forward without
                    concern about the technical rules relating to conflict of interest unless the transaction is of such importance that it is or should be considered by the board of directors or the director may be deemed to have a material financial
                    interest in the transaction. Thus, section 8.31 covers transactions between corporations with interlocking or common directors as well as the direct “interested director” transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. “Fairness” of a transaction
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fairness of a transaction for purposes of section 8.31 should be evaluated on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they were known or should have been known at the time the transaction was entered into. For example, the terms of a transaction
                    subject to section 8.31 should normally be deemed “fair” if they are within the range that might have been entered into at arm’s-length by disinterested persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. An “interested” director
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act does not attempt to define precisely when a director should be viewed as “interested” for purposes of participating in the decision to adopt, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. Secton 8.31(b) does, however, define one
                    aspect of this concept—the “indirect” interest. For purposes of section 8.31 a director should normally be viewed as interested in a transaction if he or the immediate members of his family have a financial interest in the transaction
                    or a relationship with the other parties to the transaction such that the relationship might reasonably be expected to affect his judgment in the particular matter in a manner adverse to the corporation.

                    This section replaces former G.S. 55-30(b); subsection (a) of the prior law is covered by G.S. 55-8-11. The section is more precise than former G.S. 55-30(b) in several respects. First, it says that a conflict of interest transaction “is not voidable
                    by the corporation solely because of the director’s interest” if it passes one of the three prescribed tests, thus recognizing that it might be voidable for some other reason. Second, subsection (b) of this section defines “indirect
                    interest.” Finally, subsections (c) and (d) define the manner in which the transaction may be approved by the disinterested directors or shareholders, respectively. The specific requirement of “good faith” by the directors in former
                    G.S. 55-30(b)(1) is unnecessary because it is generally imposed by G.S. 55-8-30.

                <p>
                    Section 8.32 treats specially a second type of conflict of interest transaction: loans by the corporation to directors (including loans obtained by directors from third persons on the basis of the corporation’s credit). Early statutes in many states made
                    all these loans unlawful because they were believed to be inherently subject to abuse; the modern view epitomized by section 8.32 recognizes that these loans may be proper and desirable in some situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic test for validity under section 8.32(a) is that either (1) the particular loan is approved by a majority of the shares or by the board of directors after a specific finding that the loan benefits the corporation, or (2) the loan is pursuant
                    to a general plan approved by the board of directors as being of benefit to the corporation. This type of plan will normally cover at least directors, officers, and high-level employees, and possibly lower level employees as well.
                    Examples of these plans are employee benefit plans, plans authorizing loans of petty cash, and advances for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director, officer, or employee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.32(b) makes clear that an irregular or improper loan is nevertheless legally enforceable by the corporation by the corporation against the borrower.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.32(c) provides for an exception for loans by banks, savings and loans, and other lending institutions that are authorized by law to make loans to directors in the ordinary course of business. The protections provided by the statutes applicable
                    to these entities render unnecessary the protections provided by section 8.32.

                    Former G.S. 55-22 required shareholder approval of loans to directors, officers, and dominant shareholders. This section permits the board of directors to authorize loans to directors without shareholder approval if the board determines that the loan
                    benefits the corporation. There are no special limits on loans to officers who are not directors or to dominant shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act by the addition of the words “directly or indirectly” to the loan prohibition in subsection (a) of this section. These words are then defined in a new subsection (d).

       The Business Lawyer.
      </i> Subsection (b) was modified for greater precision in terminology. The limitation period in subsection (c) was increased to three rather than two years, and the subsection was clarified to ensure that the rights of individual
                    directors to contribution and reimbursement under subsection (b) cannot be cut off before their own liability or lack thereof is determined.

                <p>
                    Section 8.40 permits every corporation to designate the officers it wants. The designation may be made in the bylaws or by the board of directors consistently with the bylaws. This is a departure from earlier versions of the Model Act and most state corporation
                    acts, which require certain officers, usually the president, the secretary, and the treasurer, and generally authorize the corporation to designate additional or assistant officers. Experience has shown, however, that little purpose
                    is served by a statutory requirement that there be certain officers, and statutory requirements may sometimes create problems of implied or apparent authority or confusion with nonstatutory offices the corporation desires to create.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board of directors may appoint assistant officers pursuant to its general powers under section 8.40(a); duly appointed officers may also appoint assistant officers if authorized by the board under section 8.40(b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the Model Act, the act of a board designating an officer is referred to as an “appointment” rather than an “election.” The Act also consistently uses the word “elect” when referring to the selection of directors, thus emphasizing the difference
                    in the selection process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board of directors, as well as duly appointed corporate officers or other agents, may also appoint agents for the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bylaws or the board of directors must also delegate to an officer the responsibility to prepare minutes and authenticate records of the corporation; the person performing this function is referred to as the “secretary” of the corporation throughout
                    the Model Act. See section 1.40. Under this Act a corporation may have this and all other corporate functions performed by a single individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The person who is designated by the bylaws or the board as responsible for maintaining minutes of meetings and authenticating records of the corporation thereby has authority to bind the corporation by his authentication under this section. This delegation
                    of authority, traditionally vested in the corporate “secretary,” allows third persons to rely on authenticated records without inquiring into their truth or accuracy.

                <p>
                    This section was adapted from the corresponding section of the Model Act with several changes. The word “required” was deleted from the catchline of the section because it covers officers that are optional as well as those that are required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No changes were made in subsections (a) and (b). Subsection (b) permits the board of directors to authorize officers to appoint other officers or assistant officers, whereas former G.S. 55-34 was silent on this point. The drafters were in favor of this
                    provision but noted that the appointment should be documented as a practical matter, e.g., in the minute books.

                        In a business dispute involving asserted allegations of breach of a covenant-not-to-compete and other claims, a trial court erred by granting defendants summary judgment on the issue of whether one of defendants’ level of control and authority rose to
                        the level of a de facto officer as, although none of plaintiff’s corporate records indicated that the defendant was the president of plaintiff, testimony from plaintiff stated that the defendant was promoted to that position when
                        the defendant signed the covenant-not-to-compete and other agreements and that the defendant’s own business cards named him as president of plaintiff. Kinesis Adver., Inc. v.

                <p>
                    Section 8.41 recognizes that persons designated as officers have the formal authority set forth for that position (1) by its description in the bylaws, (2) by specific resolution of the board of directors, or (3) by direction of another officer authorized
                    by the board of directors to prescribe the duties of other officers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These methods of investing officers with formal authority do not exhaust the sources of an officer’s actual or apparent authority. Many cases state that specific corporate officers, particularly the chief executive officer, may have implied authority
                    merely by virtue of their positions. This authority, which may overlap the express authority granted by the bylaws, generally has been viewed as extending only to ordinary business transactions, though some cases have recognized unusually
                    broad implied authority of the chief executive officer or have created a presumption that corporate officers have broad authority, thereby placing on the corporation the burden of showing lack of authority. Corporate officers may also
                    be vested with apparent (or ostensible) authority by reason of corporate conduct on which third persons reasonably rely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to express, implied, or apparent authority, a corporation is normally bound by unauthorized acts of officers if they are ratified by the board of directors. Generally, ratification extends only to acts that could have been authorized as an
                    original matter. Ratification may itself be express or implied and may in some cases serve as the basis of apparent (or ostensible) authority.

                    This section was modified by deleting the Model Act’s words “shall perform the” before the word “duties” in the first use of that word and by adding the words “authority and” before the word “duties” in the other two uses of that word.

                    Former G.S. 55-34(c) expressly gave the president of a corporation authority to institute or defend legal proceedings when the directors are deadlocked.

                    by case basis rather than having a definitive statutory statement that the president can act in such situations.

                        The day-to-day business of a corporation is actually conducted by its officers, employees and other agents under the authority and control of its board of directors. The officers of a corporation have such authority and may perform such duties in the

                        The president of a corporation by the very nature of his position is the head and general agent of the corporation, and accordingly he may act for the corporation, in the business in which the corporation is engaged. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Foil,

                        must be a previous agreement for compensation existent or in some way expressed so as to bind the company. There can be no recovery on a quantum meruit. Chiles v. United States Furn. Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 574</cite>,

                    This section provides that a nondirector officer with discretionary authority must meet the same standards of conduct required of directors under section 8.30. But his ability to rely on information, reports, or statements, may, depending upon the circumstances
                    of the particular case, be more limited than in the case of a director in view of the greater obligation he may have to be familiar with the affairs of the corporation. See section 8.42(b). Nondirector officers with more limited discretionary
                    authority may be judged by a narrower standard, though every corporate officer or agent owes duties of fidelity, honesty, good faith, and fair dealing to the corporation. The Official Comment to section 8.30 is generally applicable
                    to nondirector officers as well as to directors.

                    Subsection (c) of this section is different from the Model Act, first, in requiring “actual” knowledge and, second, in providing that an officer with such knowledge is not “entitled to the benefit of subsection (b)” instead of not “acting in good faith.”
                    This change conforms to the change made in subsection 55-8-30(c). Subsection (e) was added for clarification.

                        Shareholder’s claims that corporate officers misrepresented the corporation’s financial health, causing the value of its stock to decline, had to be brought in a derivative suit rather than an individual action. The special duty exception did not apply,

                        The right of action which accrues for the fixing and taking by one in authority of salaries, bonuses, or other moneys not honestly earned and fairly owing is based on fraud. When one seeks to recover for wrongs fraudulently inflicted, he must allege the
                        facts which, if proven, will establish the fraud. It is not sufficient merely to allege as a conclusion that the payments were “exorbitant, unreasonable, and unjust.” Fulton v. Talbert, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 183</cite>,

                        allege that he refused to violate the law in the face of a request or an instruction from the employer, as there was no allegation that the employer instructed him not to report the information to federal investigators or that

                    Section 8.43(a) is declaratory of current law. It recognizes that corporate officers may resign, that, with the consent of the board of directors, they may resign effective at a later date, and that the board of directors may fill a future vacancy to
                    become effective as of the effective date of the resignation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In part because of the unlimited power of removal, confirmed by section 8.43(b), a board of directors may grant an officer an employment contract that extends beyond the term of the board of directors. This type of contract is binding on the corporation
                    even if the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that officers are appointed for a term shorter than the period of the employment contract. If a later board of directors refuses to reappoint that person as an officer, he has
                    the right to sue for damages but not for specific performance of his employment contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.43(b) is also declaratory of current law. The tenure of all corporate officers is subject to the will of the board of directors. If the board of directors loses confidence in a corporate officer, that officer may be removed irrespective of contract
                    rights or the presence or absence of “cause” in a legal sense. Section 8.44 provides that removal of an officer who has contract rights is without prejudice to whatever rights the former officer may assert in a suit for damages for
                    breach of contract.

                    The reference to an officer “communicating his resignation” is broader language than the reference in the Model Act to “delivering notice” of the resignation. This change parallels the change made in section 55-8-07.

                        The officers of a corporation created for private purposes have no franchise in their offices, and are removable during the term for which they are appointed, when found to be incompetent or faithless. Eliason v. Coleman,

                        Where plaintiff had no written contract, and his employment was indefinite, he was not wrongfully discharged even though his employment was not terminated by the board of directors. While the board of directors may remove an officer, there is no indication

                    Section 8.43 makes clear that the appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights in the officer. The removal of an officer with contract rights is without prejudice to his later enforcement of contract rights in a suit for damages for
                    breach of contract. See the Official Comment to section 8.43. Similarly, an officer with an employment contract who prematurely resigns may be in breach of his employment contract. The mere appointment of an officer for a term does
                    not create a contractual obligation on his part to complete the term.

                    A special definition of “corporation” is included in subchapter E to make it clear that predecessor entities that have been absorbed in mergers or other transactions are included within the definition. It is probable that the same result would be reached
                    for many transactions under section 11.06 (effect of merger or share exchange), which provides for the assumption of liabilities by operation of law upon a merger. The express responsibility of successor entities for the liabilities
                    of their predecessors under this subchapter is broader than under section 11.06 and may impose liability on a successor although section 11.06 does not. Section 8.50(1) is thus an essential aspect of the protection provided by this
                    subchapter for persons eligible for indemnification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A special definition of “director” is included in subchapter E to make it clear that a person who is or was a director is covered by this subchapter while serving at the corporation’s request in another enterprise. The purpose of this definition is to
                    give directors the benefits of the protection of this subchapter while serving at the corporation’s request in a responsible position in employee benefit plans, trade associations, nonprofit or charitable entities, foreign or domestic
                    entities, and other kinds of profit or nonprofit ventures. A director serving at the corporation’s request in such a venture is viewed as acting as a director of the corporation for purposes of this subchapter even though he is also
                    acting in some other capacity in the other venture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second sentence of section 8.50(2) addresses the question of liabilities arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It makes clear that a director who is serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan is nevertheless viewed
                    as acting as a director for purposes of this subchapter. Special treatment is felt to be necessary because of the broad definition of “fiduciary” in section 3(21) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21) (1974), and the requirement of section
                    404 (§ 1104(a)) that a “fiduciary” must discharge his duties “solely in the interest” of the participants and beneficiaries of the employee benefit plan. Decisions by a director serving as a fiduciary under the plan on questions regarding
                    eligibility for benefits, investment decisions, and interpretation of plan provisions regarding qualifying service, years of service, and retroactivity are all subject to the protections of this subchapter. See also sections 8.50(4)
                    and 8.51(b) of this subchapter. Similar provisions appear in the business corporation acts of New York, N.Y. BUS. CORP. LAW ANN. § 723 (McKinney 1963), and Connecticut, CONN. GEN. STAT. ANN. § 33-320a (West Supp. 1981).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The estate or personal representative of a director is entitled to the rights of indemnification possessed by the director himself. See the last sentence of section 8.50(2). The phrase, “unless the context requires otherwise,” was added to make clear
                    that the estate or personal representative did not have the right to participate in directoral decisions whether to grant indemnification authorized in this subchapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Expenses” is defined to include counsel fees to avoid repeated references to such fees every time “expenses” appears throughout the subchapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Liability” is defined for convenience, to avoid repeated references to recoverable items throughout the subchapter. Even though the definition of “liability” includes both expenses and amounts paid to satisfy or to settle substantive claims, indemnification
                    against substantive claims is not allowed in several provisions in subchapter E. For example, indemnification in suits brought by or in the name of the corporation is limited to expenses. See section 8.51(e).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of “liability” permits the indemnification only of “reasonable expenses incurred.” The intention is that any portion of expenses falling outside the perimeter of reasonableness should not be indemnified, and that, if necessary, an allocation
                    of expenses should be made. By contrast, unlike earlier versions of the Model Act and statutes of many states, section 8.50(4) provides that amounts paid to settle or satisfy substantive claims are not subject to a reasonableness test.
                    Since payment of these amounts is permissive — mandatory indemnification is available under section 8.52 only where the defendant is “wholly successful” — a special limitation of “reasonableness” for settlements is inappropriate. Further,
                    it is undesirable to base the statutory test of power to indemnify on an affirmative finding that a settlement is reasonable. Indeed, the grant of authority to indemnify only those settlements that are “reasonable” would suggest an
                    “all or nothing” approach inconsistent with the basic philosophy of indemnification of “reasonable” expenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Penalties” and “fines” are expressly included within the definition of “liability” so that in appropriate cases these items may also be indemnified. See section 8.51. The purpose of this definition is to cover every type of monetary obligation that may
                    be imposed upon a director, including civil penalties (which have been authorized in a number of recent statutes), restitution, and obligations to give notice (which are proposed as part of the revision of the federal criminal code).
                    This definition also expressly includes the levy of excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to ERISA within the definition of “fines.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of “official capacity” is necessary because the term determines which of the two alternative standards of conduct set forth in section 8.51 applies: if action is taken in an “official capacity,” the person to be indemnified must have reasonably
                    believed he was acting in the best interests of the corporation, while if the action in question was not taken in his “official capacity,” he need only have reasonably believed that the conduct was not opposed to the best interests
                    of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definition of “party” establishes the basic coverage of the subchapter. The definition includes every individual “who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.” A person who is only called as a witness is
                    not a “party” within this definition, and as specifically provided in section 8.58(b), indemnification of this person is not limited by this subchapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The broad definition of “proceeding” ensures that the benefits of this subchapter will be available to directors in new and unexpected, as well as traditional, types of proceedings whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative. It also includes
                    appeals in lawsuits and petitions to review administrative actions.

                    Subsection (a) of this section contains a policy statement that is not in the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The definitions in subsection (b) are essentially the same as in the Model Act, and in the opinion of the drafters they all broaden the scope of prior law. For example, “corporation” includes predecessor entities (e.g., in a merger), whether or not incorporated;
                    “director” broadens the coverage of persons who have responsibilities with respect to employee benefit plans and includes the successors of deceased directors; “party” includes persons who are threatened to be named as a party; and
                    “proceeding” includes any kind of formal or informal proceeding, whether threatened or actual. The drafters do not believe there are any uncertainties or ambiguities in any of these definitions that permit a court to limit their scope,
                    and any contrary restrictive decision by a court of another jurisdiction should be overridden by the broad public policy intent expressed in G.S. 55-8-50(a).

                    The standards for indemnification of directors contained in this subsection define the outer limits for which voluntary indemnification is permitted under the Model Act. Conduct which does not meet these standards is not eligible for voluntary indemnification
                    under the Model Act, although court-ordered indemnification may be available under section 8.54(2). Conduct that falls within these outer limits does not automatically entitle directors to indemnification, although many corporations
                    have adopted bylaw provisions that obligate the corporation to indemnify directors to the maximum extent permitted by statute. Absent such a bylaw provision, section 8.52 defines a much narrower area in which the directors are entitled
                    as a matter of right to indemnification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some state statutes provide separate, but usually similarly worded, standards for indemnification in third-party suits and indemnification in suits brought by or in the name of the corporation. The Model Act establishes a single uniform test to make clear
                    that the outer limits of conduct for which indemnification is permitted should not be dependent on the type of proceeding in which the claim arises. To prevent circularity in recovery, however, section 8.51(e) limits indemnification
                    in connection with suits brought by or in the name of the corporation to expenses incurred and excludes amounts paid to settle or satisfy substantive claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The standards of conduct described in sections 8.5(a)(1) and 8.5(a)(2)(i) — that a director’s conduct in his official capacity was in “good faith” and in the corporation’s “best interests” — is closely related to the basic standards of conduct imposed
                    by section 8.30, but the two standards are not identical. No attempt is made to define “good faith,” a term used in both section 8.30 and section 8.51. The concept of good faith involves a subjective test, which would include “a mistake
                    of judgment,” in the words of the Official Comment to section 8.30, even though made unwisely by objective standards. But the affirmative requirement of section 8.30 — that the “care of an ordinarily prudent person in a like position”
                    be exercised — is not included in the standard of conduct for indemnification. On the other hand, section 8.51 requires that there be a “reasonable” belief on the part of the director in most instances, and in the case of criminal
                    proceedings that there be no “reasonable” cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, it is possible that a director who has not acted “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under
                    similar circumstances,” as required by section 8.30, could nevertheless be indemnified if the standard of section 8.51 were met. As a corollary, it is clear that a director who has met the section 8.30 standards of conduct would be
                    eligible in virtually every case to be indemnified under section 8.51.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.5(a)(2)(ii) requires, if a director is not acting in his official capacity, that his action be “at least not opposed to” the corporation’s best interests. This standard is applicable to the director when serving another entity at the request
                    of the corporation or when sued simply because he is or was a director. The words “at least” were added to qualify “not opposed to” in order to make it clear that this test is an outer limit for conduct other than in an official capacity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section makes clear that a director who is serving as a trustee or fiduciary for an employee benefit plan under ERISA meets the standard for indemnification under section 8.51(a) if he reasonably believes his conduct was in the best interests of
                    the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan. This standard is a specific application of the more general test that conduct not in official corporate capacity is indemnifiable if it is “at least not opposed to” the best interests
                    of the corporation and provides a standard for indemnification that is consistent with the statutory policies embodied in ERISA. See the Official Comment to section 8.50.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of section 8.51(c) is to reject the argument that indemnification is automatically improper whenever a proceeding has been terminated on a basis that does not exonerate the director claiming indemnification. Even though a final judgment or
                    conviction is not automatically determinative of the issue whether the minimum standard of conduct was met, any judicial determination of substantive liability would in most instances be entitled to considerable weight. By the same
                    token, it is clear that the termination of a proceeding by settlement or plea of nolo contendere should not of itself create a presumption either that conduct met or did not meet the standard of section 8.51. On the other hand, a final
                    determination of nonliability or acquittal automatically entitles the director to indemnification of expenses under section 8.52.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.51(c) applies expressly to indemnification expenses in derivative actions as well as to indemnification in third party suits. The most likely application of this subsection to derivative actions will be to settlements since a judgment or order
                    would normally result in liability to the corporation and thereby preclude all indemnification under section 8.51(d). In the rare event that a judgment or order entered against the director did not include a determination of liability
                    to the corporation, the entry of the judgment or order would not be determinative that the director failed to meet the requisite standard of conduct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This subsection makes clear that indemnification is not permissible under section 8.51 in the face of a finding of improper conduct either because liability is imposed in favor of the corporation in a suit brought by or in its name or because there is
                    a finding that the director improperly received a personal benefit as a result of his conduct. Indemnification under this subsection is prohibited if a director is adjudged liable in a derivative suit because it is believed that there
                    should be no indemnification in this situation unless a court first finds it proper. Section 8.54 permits a director found liable to the corporation to petition a court for a judicial determination of entitlement to indemnification.
                    Voluntary indemnification is also prohibited if there has been an adjudication that a director improperly received a personal benefit, even if, for example, he acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
                    Improper use of inside information for personal benefit should not be an action for which the corporation may provide indemnification, even if the corporation was not thereby harmed. Although it is unlikely that a person found liable
                    for receiving an improper personal benefit would be found to have met the statutory standard of conduct set forth in section 8.51(a)(2)(ii), this limitation is made explicit in section 8.51(d)(2). Recourse to a court under section
                    8.54 may also be appropriate in some improper benefit cases — for example, where it would be unfair for a small personal benefit to foreclose indemnification in an expensive and complicated matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This subsection limits indemnification in suits brought by or in the right of the corporation to expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding. Its purpose is to avoid circularity that would be involved if a corporation seeks to indemnify a director
                    for payments made in settlement by the director to the corporation. This subsection applies only to settlements since all indemnification is prohibited by section 8.5(d)(1) — subject to the right to seek judicially approved indemnification
                    under section 8.54 — in cases where a director is “adjudged” liable to the corporation.

                    This section differs in two respects from Section 8.51 of the Model Act. First, the qualifying clause “that is concluded without a final adjudication on the issue of liability” was added to subsection (e) to make it clear that the subsection applies only
                    to settlements, as noted in the Official Comment on that subsection, and thus to remove any possible conflict with the prohibition in subdivision (d)(1) against indemnification under this section in a proceeding in which the director
                    was adjudged liable to the corporation. Second, the entire subsection (f) was added.

                    Unless limited by its articles of incorporation, a corporation shall indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party because he is or was a director of the corporation

                <p>
                    Section 8.51 determines whether indemnification may be made voluntarily by a corporation if it elects to do so. Section 8.52 determines whether a corporation must indemnify a director for his expenses; in other words, section 8.52 creates a statutory
                    right of indemnification in favor of the director who meets the requirements of that section. Enforcement of this right by judicial proceeding is specifically contemplated by section 8.54(1), which also gives the director a statutory
                    right to recover expenses incurred by him in enforcing his statutory right to indemnification under section 8.52.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic standard for mandatory indemnification is that the director has been “wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise,” in the defense of the proceeding. The word “wholly” is added to avoid the argument accepted in
                    <i>
       Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Wolfson,
      </i> 321 A.2d 138 (Del. 1974), that a defendant may be entitled to partial mandatory indemnification if he succeeded by plea bargaining or otherwise to obtain the dismissal of some but not all counts of an indictment. A defendant
                    is “wholly successful” only if the entire proceeding is disposed of on a basis which involves a finding of nonliability. However, the language in earlier versions of the Model Act and in many other state statutes that the basis of
                    success may be “on the merits or otherwise” is retained. While this standard may result in an occasional defendant becoming entitled to indemnification because of procedural defenses not related to the merits — e.g., the statute of
                    limitations or disqualification of the plaintiff, it is unreasonable to require a defendant with a valid procedural defense to undergo a possibly prolonged and expensive trial on the merits in order to establish eligibility for mandatory
                    indemnification.

                <p>
                    It is often critically important to a director who is made a party to a complex proceeding that the corporation he served have power to make advances for expenses at the beginning of and during the proceeding. Adequate legal representation and adequate
                    preparation of a defense may require substantial payments of expenses before a final determination, and unless the corporation may make advances for expenses, a defendant may be unable to finance his own defense. This problem is complicated
                    by reason of the fact that during the early stages of a proceeding (when advances are often needed) the facts underlying the claim cannot be fully evaluated and the board of directors therefore cannot accurately ascertain the ultimate
                    propriety of indemnification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.53 establishes a workable standard: indemnification is permitted if the facts then known to those making the determination do not establish that indemnification would be precluded under section 8.51. The directors (or special legal counsel)
                    making the determination under section 8.53(c) would normally communicate with counsel and the person or persons monitoring the matter for the corporation in order to gain familiarity with the status of the proceeding and the relevant
                    facts that have emerged, but it is not required (or expected) that any form of independent investigation be undertaken for purposes of the determination. Thus, an advance may be made under section 8.53 unless it becomes clear, from
                    the facts at hand, that indemnification under section 8.51 cannot be provided. As additional facts become known, a different determination may be required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section is a compromise between the view of some that advances should be made automatically at the claimant’s request and at any time before the litigation is terminated and the view of others that a special investigation should be made before each
                    advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the requirement that the facts then known to those acting on the request for an advance do not preclude indemnification, section 8.53(a) requires a written affirmation by the director of his good faith belief that he has met the standard
                    of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he has not met the standard of conduct. Under section 8.53(b),
                    the undertaking need not be secured and financial ability to repay is not a prerequisite. The theory underlying this subsection is that, in advancing expenses, wealthy directors should not be favored over directors whose financial
                    resources are modest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The limitations of section 8.53 apply only to persons who are directors at the time the advance is made. Thus the corporation may advance the expenses of former directors without obtaining the undertaking otherwise required by section 8.53(a)(1) or (2).

                    Unless a corporation’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt

                    Section 8.54 permits court-ordered indemnification in two situations: (1) a director entitled to mandatory indemnification may enforce that entitlement by judicial proceeding (in which case the court may also order the corporation to pay the reasonable
                    expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding); and (2) indemnification at the court’s discretion is permitted in all cases whether or not the director met the requisite standard of conduct in section 8.51 or is otherwise ineligible
                    for indemnification. But indemnification with respect to derivative suits or improper benefit is always limited to expenses by the last clause of section 8.54(2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application for indemnification under section 8.54 may be made either to the court in which the proceeding was heard or to another court of appropriate jurisdiction. For example, a defendant in a criminal action who has been convicted but believes that
                    indemnification would be proper could apply either to the court which heard the criminal action or bring an action against the corporation in another court. A decision by the board of directors not to oppose the request for indemnification
                    is governed by the general standards of conduct found in section 8.30. Even if the corporation decided not to oppose the request, the court must satisfy itself that the person seeking indemnification is properly entitled to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation may limit the right of a director under section 8.54 by a provision in its articles of incorporation. In the absence of such a provision, however, the court has general power to grant indemnification under this section.

                    Section 8.55 provides the method for determining whether a corporation should voluntarily indemnify directors under section 8.51. In this section a distinction is made between a “determination” and an “authorization.” A “determination” involves a decision
                    whether under the circumstances the person seeking indemnification has met the requisite standard of conduct under section 8.51 and is therefore eligible for indemnification. This decision may be made by the persons or groups described
                    in section 8.55(b). In addition, after a favorable “determination” is made, the corporation must “authorize” indemnification; this includes a review of the reasonableness of the expenses, the financial ability of the corporation to
                    make the payment, and the judgment whether limited financial resources should be devoted to this or some other use by the corporation. Section 8.55(c) provides that “authorization” of indemnification may be made only by the board of
                    directors, by a committee of the board, or by the shareholders. While special legal counsel may make the “determination” of eligibility for indemnification, he may not “authorize” the indemnification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.55(b) establishes a procedure for selecting the person or persons who will make the determination of eligibility for indemnification. Even though directors who are parties to the proceeding may not participate in the decision determining eligibility
                    for indemnification, they may, if necessary to permit valid action by the board of directors, participate in the decision establishing a committee of independent directors or selecting special legal counsel. Directors who are parties
                    may also participate in the decision to “authorize” indemnification on the basis of a favorable “determination” if necessary to permit action by the board of directors. This limited participation of interested directors in the decision
                    is justified by a principle of necessity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legal counsel authorized to make the required determination is referred to as “special legal counsel.” In earlier versions of the Model Act, and in the statutes of many states, he is referred to as “independent” legal counsel. The word “special” is felt
                    to be more descriptive of the role to be performed and is not intended to indicate that the counsel selected should not be independent in accordance with governing legal precepts. “Special legal counsel” should normally be counsel
                    having no prior professional relationship with those seeking indemnification, should be retained for the specific occasion, and should not be either inside counsel or regular outside counsel. It is important that the selection process
                    be sufficiently flexible to permit selection of counsel in light of the particular circumstances and so that unnecessary expense may be avoided. Hence the phrase “special legal counsel” is not defined in the statute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Determinations by shareholders rather than by directors or special counsel are permitted by section 8.55(b)(4), but shares owned by or voted under the control of directors seeking indemnification may not be voted on the determination of eligibility for
                    indemnification. This does not affect rules governing the determination of a quorum at the meeting.

                    of indemnification granted to directors by this subchapter. The rights of employees or agents may derive from principles of agency, the doctrine of respondeat superior, or collective bargaining or other contractual agreement, rather
                    than from the statute. Indemnification of employees or agents may appropriately protect the person indemnified from liabilities incurred while serving at the corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, or agent
                    of another commercial, charitable, or nonprofit enterprise. See the definition of “director” in section 8.50(2). But indemnification under section 8.56(3) must ultimately be “consistent with law.” In effect, this leaves public policy
                    determinations as to what are permissible limits, in a particular case, to the courts. For example, in

      </i> 297 F.2d 418, 423 (9th Cir. 1961), the court allowed indemnification of an officer and an employee, both of whom pleaded nolo contendere to an antitrust indictment at the corporation’s request, the court reasoning that they
                    had foregone their personal right to defend for the corporation’s benefit. On the other hand, the court indicated in dictum that an agreement in advance by the corporation to indemnify anyone convicted of antitrust violations would
                    be against public policy.

                    of indemnification granted to directors by this subchapter. The rights of employees or agents may derive from principles of agency, the doctrine of respondeat superior, or collective bargaining or other contractual agreement, rather
                    than from the statute. Indemnification of employees or agents may appropriately protect the person indemnified from liabilities incurred while serving at the corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, or agent
                    of another commercial, charitable, or nonprofit enterprise. See the definition of “director” in section 8.50(2). But indemnification under section 8.56(3) must ultimately be “consistent with law.” In effect, this leaves public policy
                    determinations as to what are permissible limits, in a particular case, to the courts. For example, in
                    <i>
       Koster v. Warren,
      </i> 297 F.2d 418, 423 (9th Cir. 1961), the court allowed indemnification of an officer and an employee, both of whom pleaded nolo contendere to an antitrust indictment at the corporation’s request, the court reasoning that they
                    had foregone their personal right to defend for the corporation’s benefit. On the other hand, the court indicated in dictum that an agreement in advance by the corporation to indemnify anyone convicted of antitrust violations would
                    be against public policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The broad grant of indemnification in section 8.56(3) may be limited by appropriate provisions in the articles of incorporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.56 provides that officers, employees, or agents who are also directors are subject to the same standards of indemnification as other directors. Consideration was given to whether these officer-directors, if acting in their capacity as an officer
                    but not as a director, should have the benefit of the additional flexibility afforded by section 8.56(3) for officers who are not directors. It was concluded, however, that all directors should be treated alike; complications may be
                    created if directors who are not officers have potentially less protection under the statute than directors who are officers. It would also be difficult in many instances to distinguish in what capacity an officer-director is acting.
                    Finally, this subchapter offers sufficient flexibility in indemnifying directors so that, as a practical matter, foreseeable problems for officer-directors can be handled within the statutory framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.56(1) grants nondirector officers the same mandatory rights to indemnification under section 8.52 (or to petition a court for indemnification under section 8.54) as are granted directors. Thus, the net effect of section 8.56 is to provide officers
                    with no less protection than is provided directors (including protection for service to third parties at the request of the corporation) and, additionally, to permit the corporation to provide broader indemnification for officers who
                    are not directors.

                    The words “who is not a director” appear after the words “of the corporation” in subdivisions 8.56(1) and (2) of the Model Act. The drafters omitted that language from the North Carolina version, without intending to change the meaning of the section,
                    because they believe the words were unnecessary and confusing. If an officer, employee or agent is also a director, his rights of indemnification in his capacity as director will be defined by the other sections and his indemnification
                    rights in his capacity as officer, employee or agent will be defined by this section. The addition of the unnecessary language in the Model Act might possibly be read as limiting a director’s indemnification rights if he is also an
                    officer, which was not intended.

                    Section 8.57 authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of directors, officers, employees, or agents against liabilities imposed on them by reason of actions in their official capacity or arising from their service to the corporation
                    or another entity at the corporation’s request. Insurance is not limited to claims against which corporations are entitled to indemnify under this subchapter. This insurance, usually referred to as “D&amp;O Liability Insurance,” provides
                    a useful supplement to the rights of indemnification created by this subchapter, providing a source of reimbursement for corporations who indemnify directors and others for conduct covered by the insurance, and protecting the insureds
                    against the corporation’s failure to pay indemnification required or permitted by this subchapter. On the other hand, policies do not cover uninsurable events like self-dealing, bad faith, knowing violations of the securities acts,
                    or other willful misconduct. See generally Johnston, “Corporate Indemnification and Liability Insurance,” 33 BUS. LAW. 1993 (1978); Hinsey, “The New Lloyd’s Policy Form for Directors and Officers’ Liability Insurance — An Analysis,”

                    Section 8.57 of the Model Act is entitled “Insurance” and deals only with that subject. In the North Carolina version the catchline has been expanded and the section is intended to permit broad nonstatutory indemnification completely in addition to and
                    notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act. G.S. 55-8-50(a) expressly states that purpose and declares it to be the public policy of North Carolina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section permits indemnification, insurance and reimbursement of expenses in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other provisions of this Chapter. The section embodies the public policy of this State set forth in G.S. 55-8-50(a) to permit a corporation
                    organized under this Chapter to spread the risk of corporate management, notwithstanding any other general or special law of this State or of any other jurisdiction including the federal government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (a) permits and defines the scope of contractual indemnification under which the corporation, essentially as a self-insurer, may commit in advance to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents. This provision brings forward and
                    clarifies all of former G.S. 55-19(a), which was added by the 1986 amendments. It adds an express statement, for example, that a corporation may agree in advance to indemnify its personnel even in a corporate or derivative action,
                    subject only to the limitation brought forth from former G.S. 55-19(a).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, subsection (b) brings forward former G.S. 55-19(b) relating to the conflict of interest rules in G.S. 55-8-31 (which replaced former G.S. 55-30), but the application of the subsection to indemnification plans adopted on or after July 1, 1990
                    has been limited to public corporations (i.e., those required to file reports under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). This limitation to public corporations was considered appropriate because (1) former G.S. 55-19(b)
                    was intended to deal with the need to attract qualified outside directors — a need experienced mainly by public corporations, (2) shareholders of public corporations receive current disclosure of material changes in the indemnification
                    scheme, and (3) shareholders have an active market in which they can dispose of their shares if they disapprove of a particular scheme of indemnification. Subsection (b) does not prevent a shareholder from challenging indemnification
                    in a particular case. Instead, its effect is to shift to the shareholder of a public corporation the burden of proving that indemnification constitutes a breach of duty to the corporation under all of the facts and circumstances, including
                    the facts and circumstances existing at the time indemnification was authorized or approved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (c) replaces former G.S. 55-19(c) with section 8.57 of the Model Act because the drafters concluded that these insurance provisions of the Model Act are broader and clearer than former G.S. 55-19(c). Subsection (c) applies whether or not a
                    corporation provides additional indemnification pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). As previously noted, former G.S. 55-19(d) was brought forward as G.S. 55-8-53.

                <p>
                    Section 8.58(a) provides that a provision treating the indemnification of directors by the corporation in articles of incorporation, bylaws, shareholders’ or directors’ resolution, or contract “is valid only if and to the extent it is consistent with”
                    this subchapter. Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states provided that the statutory provisions were not “exclusive” and made no attempt to limit the nonstatutory creation of rights of indemnification. This
                    kind of language is subject to misconstruction, however, since nonstatutory conceptions of public policy limit the power of a corporation to indemnify or to contract to indemnify directors, officers, employees, or agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language of the first sentence of section 8.58(a), “to the extent it is consistent with this subchapter,” is believed to be a more accurate description of the limited validity of nonstatutory indemnification provisions than the “nonexclusive” provisions
                    of earlier versions of the Model Act. It is important to recognize that “to the extent it is consistent with” is not synonymous with “exclusive.” Situations may well develop from time to time in which indemnification is permissible
                    under section 8.58 but would be precluded if all portions of subchapter E were viewed as exclusive. But indemnification provisions protecting against the consequences of bad faith or willful misconduct are not consistent with this
                    subchapter and would not be valid. Furthermore, they would violate well-understood principles of public policy and doubtless would be invalidated on that ground even under statutes purporting to make “nonexclusive” the statutory provisions
                    for indemnification. To the extent the consistency language may preclude indemnification in circumstances where it is reasonable and violates no statutory policy, an escape valve is provided in section 8.55(2), which authorizes a court
                    to grant indemnification if a director “is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances,” even though he may not have fully met the standards of conduct set forth in section 8.51.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.58 does not preclude provisions in articles of incorporation, bylaws, resolutions, or contracts designed to provide procedural machinery different from that provided by section 8.55 or to make mandatory the permissive provisions of subchapter
                    E. For example, a corporation may properly obligate the board of directors to consider and act expeditiously on an application for indemnification or advances, or obligate the board of directors to cooperate in the procedural steps
                    required to obtain a judicial determination under section 8.54.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some corporations currently commit themselves, in one form or another, to indemnify directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. These commitments are consistent with subchapter E, subject to appropriate interpretation in light of the
                    facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, a commitment to maintain liability insurance for a director, pursuant to section 8.57, is consistent with this subchapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first sentence of section 8.58(a) applies only to directors; it does not apply to officers, employees, or agents who are not directors. See section 8.56 and its Official Comment. The inherent problems of conflict of interest and the need to encourage
                    persons to serve as directors are not present to the same degree in the case of nondirector officers, employees, or agents. The standard for permissible indemnification of these persons in section 8.56(3) is “consistent with law” without
                    regard to this subchapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 8.58(b) is designed to make clear that subchapter E deals only with directors who are actual or prospective defendants or respondents in a proceeding, and that expenses incurred in connection with appearance as a witness may be indemnified without
                    regard to the limitations of subchapter E. Indeed, most of the standards described in sections 8.51 and 8.54 by their own terms can have no meaningful application to a director whose only connection with a proceeding is that he has

                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act in two respects. First, the first sentence of subsection 8.58(a) of the Model Act, dealing with nonstatutory contractual indemnification, has been omitted because the subject is more broadly covered by G.S. 55-8-57;
                    and second, the new subsection (c) has been added.

                <p>
                    Article 9, as set out in Session Laws 1989, ch. 265, is essentially former Article 7 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, as enacted by Session Laws 1987, c. 88, s. 1. Amendments
                    by Session Laws 1987, c. 124, ss. 1, 1.1 and 2 expired by the terms of that act on June 30, 1989. This article is not in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, and there are no Official Comments or North Carolina Comments thereto.

                <p>
                    The present Article 9, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, differs from former Article 7 as it was on June 30, 1989, in the following particulars: (1) In G.S. 55-9-01, the definition of “corporation” found in former G.S. 55-75 has expired and was
                    not reenacted (see Session Laws 1987, c. 124, s. 1) and the definition of “other entity” has been amended by changing the first reference to “corporation” to read “domestic or foreign corporation.” (2) In G.S. 55-9-05, there are new
                    opt-out provisions different from those of former G.S. 55-79. (3) Former G.S. 55-79.1 and 55-80, relating to conflict of laws and severability, expired and were not reenacted. (See Session Laws 1987, c. 124, ss. 1.1, 2.)

                    Article 9A, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, is essentially former Article 7A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, as enacted by Session Laws 1987, c. 182, s. 1,

                    The present Article 9A, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, differs from former Article 7A in three main respects. First, the term “issuing public corporation” was changed to “covered corporation.” Second, former G.S. 55-98, dealing with the effect
                    of former Article 7A on former Article 7, was deleted. Third, § 55-9A-08 was added. In addition, minor amendments to conform new Article 9A to the rest of new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>                    were made throughout the Article.

                <p>
                    Section 10.01(a) authorizes a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by adding a new provision to its articles of incorporation, modifying an existing provision, or deleting a provision in its entirety. The sole test for the validity of an
                    amendment is whether the provision could lawfully have been included in (or in the case of a deletion, omitted from) the original articles of incorporation as of the effective date of the amendment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The power of amendment must be exercised pursuant to the procedures set forth in the rest of this chapter, which require significant amendments to be approved either by a majority of the votes cast on the proposed amendment or by a majority of all of
                    the votes eligible to be cast on the proposed amendment (section 10.03). This majority vote requirement is supplemented by section 10.04, which establishes a right of voting by voting group on amendments that directly affect a single
                    class or series of shares, and by section 7.27, which treats amendments that change the voting requirements for future amendments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.01(b) restates explicitly the policy embodied in earlier versions of the Model Act and in all modern state corporation statutes, that a shareholder “does not have a vested property right” in any provision of the articles of incorporation. Corporations
                    and their shareholders are also subject to amendments of the governing statute by the state under section 1.02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.01(b) should be construed liberally and without qualification or restriction to achieve the fundamental purpose of this chapter of permitting corporate adjustment and change by majority vote. Section 10.01(b) rejects decisions by a few courts
                    that have applied a “vested rights” or “property right” doctrine to restrict or invalidate amendments to articles of incorporation because they modified particular rights conferred on shareholders by the original articles of incorporation.
                    These holdings are rejected because their effect often is to create a tyranny of the minority: the individual consent of each shareholder becomes necessary to adopt any important change, and each shareholder, no matter how small his
                    holding, can prevent the change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.01(b) does not change in any way the purpose of similar provisions in earlier versions of the Model Act, which included, along with general language similar to section 10.01(b), a long list of specific permissible amendments. This list was
                    designed to eliminate the last possible vestige of the “vested rights” theory by expressly referring to and validating all types of amendments to which a vested rights challenge could be made. Section 10.01(b) omits this “laundry list”
                    of permissible amendments as prolix and unnecessary to carry out the policies of the section. Examples of amendments that may be made under section 10.01 include:

                    A provision in the articles of incorporation is subject to amendment under section 10.01 even though the provision is described, referred to, or stated in a share certificate, information statement, or other document issued by the corporation that reflects
                    provisions of the articles of incorporation. The only exception to this unlimited power of amendment is section 6.27, which provides that share transfer restrictions may not be imposed by amendment on shares that were previously issued
                    without the consent of the holder.

                <p>
                    Section 10.01 relates only to amendments to articles of incorporation. It does not relate to the impairment of obligations of a corporation to its shareholders based upon contracts independent of the articles of incorporation. An amendment permitted by
                    this section may constitute a breach of such a contract or of a contract between the shareholders themselves. A shareholder with contractual rights (or who otherwise is concerned about possible onerous amendments) may obtain complete
                    protection against these amendments only by establishing procedures in the articles of incorporation or bylaws that limit the power of amendment without his consent. In appropriate cases, a shareholder may be able to enjoin an amendment
                    that constitutes a breach of a contract.

                    Minority shareholders are protected from the power of the majority to impose onerous or objectionable amendments by two basic devices: the right to vote on amendments by separate voting groups (section 10.04) and the right to dissent under chapter 13.
                    In addition, courts have held that a decision by majority shareholders to exercise the powers granted by this section in a way that is arguably detrimental or unfair to minority interests may be examined by a court under its inherent
                    equity power to review transactions for good faith and fair dealing.

                    The amendments described in clauses (1) through (6) are so routine and “housekeeping” in nature as not to require action by shareholders. None affects substantive rights in any meaningful way. For example, section 10.02(1) authorizes amendments by the
                    board of directors to extend the duration of a corporation that was formed at a time when limited duration was required by law. The extension normally will be in the form of an amendment to delete all reference to the duration of the
                    corporation, which automatically makes the duration perpetual. See section 3.02. Similarly, sections 10.02(2) and (3) authorize the board of directors to delete the names of initial directors, or the name and address of the initial
                    registered agent and registered office, set forth in the original articles if that information is obsolete. Section 10.02(4) authorizes the board of directors to change each issued and unissued share of an outstanding class of shares
                    into a greater number of whole shares if the corporation has only that class of shares outstanding. All shares of the class being changed must be treated identically under this clause. Section 10.02(5) authorizes minor name changes
                    without shareholder approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.02(6) recognizes that other sections of the Model Act expressly permit other amendments to be made by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval. Examples of these include section 6.02 (creation of series of shares pursuant to
                    authority already granted in the articles) and section 6.31 (cancellation of reacquired shares if the articles provide they are not to be reissued).

                    Amendments provided for in this section may be included in restated articles of incorporation under section 10.07 or in articles of merger under chapter 11.

                    of shares. Subdivision 10.02(1) of the Model Act, relating to an amendment to extend the duration of a corporation if it was incorporated at a time when limited duration was required by law, was omitted, because limited duration has
                    not been required by North Carolina law.

                    corporation is prohibited from reissuing acquired shares and (ii) the addition of a provision authorizing a board of directors to amend the articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares as necessary to permit
                    a share dividend if the corporation has only one class of shares outstanding.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Significant amendments to articles of incorporation must be approved by the shareholders after being proposed by the board of directors. When proposing an amendment, the board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the amendment
                    be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstance, and communicate
                    the basis for its determination, when presenting the proposed amendment to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.03(c) codifies existing practice by expressly permitting the board of directors to submit an amendment to the shareholders on a conditional basis. This power of the board of directors does not alter the balance of power between the board of
                    directors and shareholders since the board of directors may always withhold its approval entirely and not submit an amendment. Examples of conditions commonly imposed are that the amendment not be approved unless (1) a favorable vote
                    by a specified proportion (larger than ordinarily required) of the shareholders is obtained, (2) no more than a specified fraction of the shareholders file written dissents, or (3) a class or series of shares must approve the amendment
                    as a separate voting group. These conditions may be used, for example, to discourage unwise depletion of corporate assets by the adoption of the amendment. The board of directors is not limited to conditions of these types, however,
                    and may condition the submission on any basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vote of shareholders needed to approve an amendment depends in part on the voting groups entitled to vote separately on the amendment and in part on whether any of those voting groups would be entitled to dissenters’ rights if the amendment were adopted.
                    See section 10.04. However, section 10.03(e) itself establishes a dual requirement for approval by shareholders of each voting group depending on the nature of the amendment: under section 7.25 and 7.26 a majority of the votes cast
                    affirmatively and negatively on the amendment at a meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary to approve most amendments; but if the amendment would give rise to dissenters’ rights under chapter 13, section 10.03(e) requires
                    that it be approved by a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of each voting group that will have dissenters’ rights if the amendment were adopted, and by the vote required by sections 7.25 and 7.26 by other voting groups
                    that are entitled to vote on the amendment. This increased voting requirement reflects the importance of these proposals. Of course, the articles of incorporation may specify a greater quorum or voting requirement for a voting group
                    to approve an amendment of any type. See section 7.27.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The articles of incorporation or the board of directors may require that a proposed amendment be approved by a class or series of shares voting as a separate voting group; such a requirement may only be in addition to that otherwise required by section
                    10.04 of this Act.

                <p>
                    This section continues the usual procedure under former G.S. 55-100(b) for adoption of amendments to the articles of incorporation by action of the board of directors and then by the shareholders. It adds two new features. First, the board of directors
                    must recommend the amendment to the shareholders, unless it determines that, because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances, it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its lack of a recommendation
                    to the shareholders. Second, the section specifically authorizes the board of directors to condition its submission of a proposed amendment “on any basis.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section omits the Model Act’s requirement that notice of the meeting at which the proposed amendment will be considered and of the proposed amendment itself be given to all shareholders of the corporation whether or not entitled to vote on the proposed
                    amendment. Accordingly, the section continues the procedure under former G.S. 55-100(b)(2) of giving notice only to those shareholders entitled to vote on the proposed amendment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under former G.S. 55-100(b)(1), an amendment to the articles of incorporation could be initiated by shareholders entitled to call a shareholders’ meeting. There is no similar procedure in this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A clarifying stylistic change was made to the Model Act’s language in subsection (b) of this section.

                <p>
                    A class or series of shares is generally entitled to vote separately as a voting group on any amendment that affects the class or series in the manner described in subdivisions (1) through (9) of section 10.04(a). Shares are entitled to vote as separate
                    voting groups under this section even though they are designated as nonvoting shares in the articles of incorporation, or the articles of incorporation purport to deny them entirely the right to vote on the proposal in question, or
                    purport to allow other classes or series of shares to vote as part of the same voting group. See section 10.04(d). If an amendment would create dissenters’ rights with respect to any class or series of shares, the amendment must be
                    approved by each voting group that would have dissenters’ rights by a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the amendment, and by other voting groups by the vote required by sections 7.25 and 7.26. See section 10.04(b). All
                    other amendments are subject to the voting requirements generally applicable to voting groups under sections 7.25 and 7.26.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to vote by voting groups under section 10.04 is applicable only if “shareholder voting is otherwise required by this Act.” An amendment that does not require shareholder approval, such as the creation of a new series of shares pursuant to authority
                    reserved in the original articles of incorporation (see section 6.02), does not trigger the right to vote by voting groups under this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The right to vote as a separate voting group provides a major protection for classes or series of shares with preferential rights or classes or series of limited or nonvoting shares against amendments that are especially burdensome to that class. This
                    section, however, does not make the right to vote by separate voting group dependent on an evaluation of whether the amendment is detrimental to the class or series: if the amendment is one of those described in section 10.04(a), the
                    class or series is automatically entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the amendment. The question whether an amendment is detrimental is often a question of judgment, and approval by the affected class or series is required,
                    irrespective of whether the board or other shareholders believe it is beneficial or detrimental to the affected class or series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nine types of changes that give rise to voting by voting groups are essentially the same as in earlier versions of the Model Act, though their number has been reduced based on the conclusion that some of the changes listed in earlier versions were
                    subsumed within other listed changes. Subsections (b) and (c) extend the privilege of voting by separate voting group to one or more series of a class of shares if the series has unique financial or voting provisions and is affected
                    in one or more of the ways described in subsection (a). These subsections must necessarily be phrased in general terms; any significant distinguishing feature of a series, which an amendment affects or alters, should trigger the right
                    of voting by separate voting group for that series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application of subsections (b) and (c) may best be illustrated by an example. Assume there is a class of shares with preferential rights comprised of three series, each with different preferential dividend rights. A proposed amendment would reduce
                    the rate of dividend applicable to the “Series A” shares and would change the dividend right of the “Series B” shares from a cumulative to a noncumulative right. The amendment would not affect the preferential dividend right of the
                    “Series C” shares. Both Series A and B would be entitled to vote as separate voting groups on the proposed amendment; the holders of the Series C shares, not directly affected by the amendment, would not be entitled to vote at all
                    unless the shares are otherwise voting shares under the articles of incorporation, in which case they would not vote as a separate voting group but in the voting group consisting of all shares with general voting rights under the articles
                    of incorporation. If the proposed amendment would reduce the dividend right of Series A and change the dividend right of both Series B and C from a cumulative to a noncumulative right, the holders of Series A would be entitled to vote
                    as a single voting group, and the holders of Series B and C would be required to vote together as a single, separate voting group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 7.25 and 7.26 set forth the mechanics of voting by multiple voting groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.04(d) makes clear that the limited right to vote by separate voting groups provided by section 10.04 may not be narrowed or eliminated by the articles of incorporation. Even if a class or series of shares is described as “nonvoting” and the
                    articles purport to make that class or series nonvoting “for all purposes,” that class or series nevertheless has the limited voting right provided by this section. Section 10.04(d) was included because of the ambiguity that would
                    normally arise whenever a class or series of nonvoting shares is created; no inference of any kind should be drawn from section 10.04(d) as to whether other, unrelated sections of the Model Act may be modified by the provisions in
                    the articles of incorporation.

                    The articles of amendment must set forth both the amendment itself and the manner in which it was adopted. In the case of an amendment approved by shareholder vote (sections 10.03 and 10.04), the articles must state either the total vote in favor and
                    against the proposal or the undisputed vote for and a statement that this vote was sufficient to adopt the amendment. The latter tally method is permitted because in many situations the precise vote may depend on the resolution of
                    protracted disputes with respect to proxy votes. The filing of the articles of amendment should not be dependent on the resolution of every dispute if it is certain that a sufficient vote has been obtained without considering the disputed
                    votes. In most situations, of course, the precise vote can be readily determined, and when it can the articles should record it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.06(a)(3) requires the articles of amendment to contain a statement of the manner in which an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of issued shares is to be put into effect if not set forth in the amendment itself. This requirement avoids
                    any possible confusion that may arise as to how the amendment is to be put into effect and also permits the amendment itself to be limited to provisions of permanent applicability, with transitional provisions having no long-range
                    effect appearing only in the articles of amendment.

                <p>
                    Restated articles of incorporation serve the useful purpose of permitting articles of incorporation that have been amended from time to time to be consolidated into a single document. Such a restatement may also eliminate “historical” or obsolete provisions
                    that have no present relevance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A restatement of articles of incorporation that does not involve any substantive change in the articles (or that makes only amendments that may be made by the board of directors without shareholder approval) may be approved by the board of directors alone.
                    In order to increase the reliability of restated articles as the definitive governing document of the corporation, section 10.07 authorizes the restated articles of incorporation to be submitted to the shareholders for approval in
                    the same manner as amendments to the articles. If duly submitted to the shareholders, substantive variation between the original articles of incorporation, as amended, and the restated articles becomes academic if the shareholders’
                    vote is the appropriate one required to amend the articles to the extent of the inconsistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Substantive amendments may also be adopted as part of a restatement. If substantive amendments are proposed, the same procedure must be followed as for the adoption of amendments under sections 10.02, 10.03, or 10.05.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If restated articles are submitted to the shareholders, the notice of meeting should identify changes in the articles that may reasonably be viewed as more than mere changes of form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.07(e) makes it clear that the restated articles of incorporation supersede the original articles of incorporation and all amendments to them, and section 10.07(f) permits the secretary of state to certify the restatement uncluttered by the
                    information set forth in subsection (e).

                    This section is in substance the same as former G.S. 55-105. The procedure for simultaneously amending and restating the articles of incorporation was clarified. The Model Act uses two terms in its comparable section, “restated articles of incorporation”
                    and “restatement,” to refer to the same document. Because the drafters concluded that the use of both could be confusing, they decided to use a single term, “restated articles of incorporation,” and made other conforming and stylistic
                    changes in subsections (c), (d), and (f).

                    articles of incorporation for shareholder action, the corporation shall notify each shareholder entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders’ meeting in accordance with G.S. 55-7-05. The notice must also (i) state that the purpose,
                    or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the proposed restated articles of incorporation, (ii) contain or be accompanied by a copy of the proposed restated articles of incorporation, and (iii) identify any amendment or
                    other change they would make in the articles”; rewrote subdivision (d)(3) and (d)(4); substituted “to the original articles of incorporation” for “to them” in subsection (e); inserted “of this section” in subsection (f); and made minor

                <p>
                    In the absence of a provision in the articles of incorporation, the power to amend or repeal bylaws is shared by the board of directors and shareholders. Amendment of bylaws by the board of directors is often simpler and more convenient than amendment
                    by the shareholders and avoids the expense of calling a shareholders’ meeting, a cost that may be significant in publicly held corporations. As used in this subchapter, “amendment” includes the adoption of a bylaw on a new subject
                    as well as the alteration of existing bylaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.20(a) provides, however, that the power to amend or repeal bylaws may be reserved exclusively to the shareholders by an appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation. This option may appropriately be elected by a closely held corporation
                    — for example, where control arrangements appear in the bylaws but one shareholder or group of shareholders has the power to name a majority of the board of directors. In such a corporation, the control arrangements may alternatively
                    be placed in the articles of incorporation rather than the bylaws if there is no objection to making them a matter of public record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.20(a)(1) provides that the power to amend or repeal the bylaws may be reserved to the shareholders “in whole or part.” This language permits the reservation of power to be limited to specific articles or sections of the bylaws or to specific
                    subjects or topics addressed in the bylaws. It is important that the areas reserved exclusively to the shareholders be delineated clearly and unambiguously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.20(a)(2) permits the shareholders to adopt or amend a bylaw and reserve exclusively to themselves the power to amend or repeal it later. This reservation must be expressed in the action by the shareholders adopting or amending the bylaw. This
                    option is also included for the benefit of closely held corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 10.20(b) states that the power of shareholders to amend or repeal bylaws exists even though that power is shared with the board of directors. This section makes inapplicable the holdings of a few cases under differently phrased statutes that shareholders
                    do not have a general or residual power to amend bylaws or that the power to amend bylaws may be vested exclusively in the board of directors. Under the Model Act the shareholders always have the power to amend or repeal the bylaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 10.21 and 10.22 limit the power of directors to adopt or amend supermajority provisions in bylaws.

                    Supermajority provisions relating to the board of directors may appear in the bylaws of the corporation without specific authorization in the articles of incorporation. See section 8.24(a) and (c). Like other bylaw provisions, they may be adopted either
                    by the board of directors or by the shareholders. See section 10.20. Such provisions, further, may be amended or repealed by the board of directors or shareholders as provided in this section. This treatment of supermajority provisions
                    for the board of directors should be contrasted with the treatment of analagous provisions for shareholders which must either be set forth in the articles of incorporation, section 7.27, or included in the bylaws when expressly authorized
                    by the articles, section 10.21, and their adoption, amendment, or repeal must be approved by the shareholders by the vote specified in sections 7.27 and 10.21.

                <p>
                    Supermajority provisions relating to the board of directors are usually part of control arrangements in closely held corporations, and section 10.22 is designed with this end in view. Its basic purpose is to ensure that control arrangements negotiated
                    by shareholders for their own protection will not be prematurely terminated by a majority vote of the shareholders or the board of directors. Thus, section 10.22(a)(1) provides that if a supermajority requirement is originally imposed
                    by a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, only the shareholders may amend or repeal it. Further, under section 10.22(b), that bylaw may impose restrictions on the manner in which it may be thereafter amended or repealed by the shareholders.
                    On the other hand, if a supermajority requirement is originally imposed in a bylaw adopted by the board of directors, that bylaw may be amended either by the board of directors or shareholders (see section 10.22(a)(2)), but if it is
                    to be amended by the board of directors, section 10.22(c) requires approval by the supermajority requirement then being imposed or amended, whichever is greater. This requirement is analogous to that imposed on supermajority amendments
                    appearing in the articles of incorporation. See section 7.27. For an example of the application of this language, see the Official Comment to section 7.27.

                    merger). Some of the holders of a single class of shares may be required to accept securities or properties while the remaining holders may be compelled to accept different securities, property, or cash. The capitalization of the surviving
                    corporation may be restructured in the merger, or its articles of incorporation may be amended by the articles of merger in any way deemed appropriate. Any other provisions considered necessary or desirable with respect to the merger
                    may be included in the plan of merger.

                    Merger transactions may give rise to voting by separate voting groups of shareholders under section 11.03(f), and dissenting shareholders may have dissenters’ rights under chapter 13.

                    Courts have held that merger transactions that are formally authorized by the procedures set forth in this chapter may in some circumstances constitute a breach of duty to minority shareholders where the effect of the transaction is to eliminate them
                    from further equity participation in the enterprise. See McBride, “Delaware Corporate Law: Judicial Scrutiny of Mergers — The Aftermath of

                    A transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory merger even though it is cast in the form of a nonstatutory transaction. For example, assets of the disappearing corporations may be sold for consideration in the form of shares of the surviving
                    corporation, followed by the distribution of those shares by the disappearing corporations to their shareholders and their subsequent dissolution. Transactions have sometimes been structured in nonstatutory form for tax reasons or
                    in an effort to avoid some of the consequences of a statutory merger, particularly appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders. Faced with these transactions, a few courts have developed or accepted the “de facto merger” concept which,
                    to some uncertain extent, grants to dissenting shareholders the rights they would have had if the transaction had been structured as a statutory merger. See Folk, “De Facto Mergers in Delaware:
                    <i>
       Hariton
      </i> v.
                    <i>
       Arco Electronics, Inc.
      </i> ,” 49 VA. L. REV. 1261 (1963). These problems should not occur under the Model Act since the procedural requirements for authorization and consequences of various types of transactions are largely standardized. For example,
                    dissenters’ rights are granted not only in mergers but also in share exchanges, in sales of all or substantially all the corporate assets, and in amendments to articles of incorporation that significantly affect rights of shareholders.

       REVISED NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY 2018
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Article 11 eliminates all references to statutory consolidation because of the infrequent use of the consolidation form of combination, in which all corporate parties to the combination disappear and an entirely new corporation is created, and because,
                    if a new entity is desirable, it may be created before the merger and the disappearing entities may merge into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third sentence of the second paragraph of the “Official Comment” to Section 11.01 of the Model Act indicates that a plan of merger can discriminate among holders of shares of the same class in the kind of property they receive in a merger. The drafters
                    believed that this sentence does not reflect the current law in North Carolina. They believed that the current law does not permit discrimination among the holders of shares of a single class that are similarly situated in the kind
                    of property that can be received in a merger; all the shares of a single class must be treated the same, both in value and kind, for similarly situated shareholders. Therefore, the drafters note their disagreement with this sentence
                    in the “Official Comment.” But see G.S. 55-6-24(b) (which expressly permits discrimination among holders of a single class or series of shares in certain shareholder rights plans).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are circumstances where shares of a single class are not similarly situated. For example, Corporation A and/r its wholly-owned subsidiaries may own a portion of the shares of common stock of Corporation B, while the remaining shares of common stock
                    of Corporation B are owned by a number of other holders. Corporation A and Corporation B may wish to engage in a merger transaction, pursuant to which Corporation A will acquire all of the shares of Corporation B not already owned
                    by Corporation A and/r its wholly-owned subsidiaries (for example in a triangular merger) and the other holders of Corporation B shares will receive a specified merger consideration for their shares. Under such circumstances, Corporation
                    A (and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) and the other holders of Corporation B stock are not similarly situated and there is no reason for them to be treated the same, so long as all of the other holders are treated equally and do not
                    receive merger consideration that is of lesser value than any received by Corporation A or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, under such circumstances, the plan of merger should properly be able to provide that the shares
                    of Corporation B held by Corporation A and its wholly-owned subsidiaries may be cancelled (and Corporation A and its wholly-owned subsidiaries not receive any merger consideration for such shares) and that the shares held by the other
                    holders of Corporation B shares may receive the specified merger consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section is not intended to change the current law in North Carolina under which shareholders may elect to receive alternative forms of consideration (e.g. cash or shares) and proration is provided if one of the alternatives is oversubscribed.

                        the corporation’s principal was also liable for the breach because he voluntarily participated in the merger knowing that it would extinguish the consultant’s stock options, and he was the sole shareholder and director of the corporation.

                    Section 11.02 establishes a procedure by which a direct exchange of shares for cash or other consideration in corporate combinations may be effected under the same safeguards applicable to statutory mergers or similar transactions. A share exchange under
                    section 11.02 is binding upon all shareholders of the acquired class or series of shares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is often desirable to effect a reorganization or combination so that the corporation being acquired does not go out of existence but becomes a subsidiary of the acquiring corporation or holding company, the securities of which are issued as part of
                    the transaction. These objectives often are particularly important in the formation of holding company systems for, or for the acquisition of, insurance companies and banks, but are not limited to these transactions. In the absence
                    of a share exchange procedure, this kind of a transaction often may be accomplished only by the process of a “reverse triangular merger”: the formation of a new subsidiary of the acquiring or holding company, followed by a merger of
                    that subsidiary into the corporation to be acquired in which securities of the new subsidiary’s parent are exchanged for securities of the corporation to be acquired. Section 11.02 provides a straightforward procedure to accomplish
                    the same end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under section 11.02, all shares of a particular class or series of shares must be acquired. However, shares of one or more classes or series may be excluded from the plan or may be included on different bases. After the plan is adopted and approved by
                    the shareholders as required by section 11.03, it is binding on all holders of shares of the class or series to be acquired; members of the class or series, however, have the right to dissent under chapter 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not necessary that a share exchange under section 11.02 be on a share-for-share basis. The consideration for the shares being acquired may be “shares, obligations, or other securities of the acquiring or any other corporation or . . . cash or other
                    property in whole or part.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.02(c) is designed to make it clear that the mandatory exchange provided by section 11.02 does not affect the power of corporations to acquire shares by voluntary exchange or otherwise by agreement with the shareholders.

                    This section introduces a concept that is new to North Carolina, i.e., a share exchange, which is defined as a transaction by which a corporation becomes the owner of all the outstanding shares of one or more classes of another corporation by an exchange

                    The same kind of transaction that is accomplished by a share exchange has in the past been accomplished by the process of a “reverse triangular merger,” which is the formation of a new subsidiary of the acquiring company, followed by a merger of that
                    subsidiary into the corporation to be acquired in which the securities of the new subsidiary’s parent are exchanged for securities of the corporation to be acquired.

                    Section 11.03 requires the board of directors to propose the plan of merger or sale exchange and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. When proposing a plan of merger or share exchange, the board of directors must make a recommendation to the
                    shareholders that the plan be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict
                    or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, when presenting the proposed plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.03(c) permits the board of directors to condition its submission of a plan of merger or share exchange on any basis; for example, the board may direct that the plan is approved only if it receives a favorable vote of a specified percentage
                    of the disinterested shareholders voting on the plan or that shareholders holding no more than a specified number or percentage of shares file notice of intent to demand payment under chapter 13. See the discussion of conditional submissions
                    in the Official Comment to section 10.03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A plan of merger or share exchange, to be approved, must be approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the merger by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under
                    section 7.25. The articles of incorporation of either corporation, however, may require a greater vote by one or more voting groups of that corporation, and if the transaction involves an amendment to the articles of incorporation
                    of the surviving corporation which affects the voting requirements for future amendments, the transaction must also be approved by the vote required by section 7.27. See section 11.03(e). In addition, voting by more than one voting
                    group may be required by section 11.03(f) or by the articles of incorporation. Finally, the board of directors may require a greater vote or a vote by voting groups under their power to make conditional submissions to shareholders
                    described above. The articles of incorporation or the board of directors, however, may only require a vote by separate voting groups in addition to that otherwise required by this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only shareholders who have the right to vote on a merger or share exchange under section 11.03 have the right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares under chapter 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.03(g) describes when approval by the shareholders of the surviving corporation is not required. The theory behind this subsection is that shareholders’ votes should be required only if the transaction fundamentally alters the character of the
                    enterprise or substantially reduces the shareholders’ participation in voting or profit distribution. It is believed that the transactions for which shareholder approval is not required by subsection (g) do not alter the investors’
                    prospects any more than many other management decisions, and thus should not require a shareholder vote. In particular, the 20 percent requirement of subsections (g)(3) and (4) is broadly consistent with the statutes of several states,
                    including Delaware (20 percent), Michigan (20 percent), and Pennsylvania (15 percent), and also with the New York Stock Exchange requirement that shareholders must be consulted if the number of outstanding shares is to be increased
                    by more than 18.5 percent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The requirement that shareholders of the surviving corporation in a statutory merger have a right to vote if the increase in the number of shares exceeds 20 percent may be avoided by arranging the transaction in the form of a merger involving a subsidiary
                    of the acquiring corporation or as a share exchange under section 11.02. This anomaly reflects a compromise among basically conflicting points of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 20 percent requirement is applicable only if the corporation has available enough authorized shares to permit it to issue the shares without amending its articles of incorporation to increase authorized capital. If it must amend its articles of incorporation
                    to authorize the shares necessary to complete the transaction, a shareholder vote on the amendment will be necessary in all cases. See section 10.03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.03(f)(1) requires voting by voting groups on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that “if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by one or more separate voting groups on the proposed
                    amendment.” See section 10.04. Under this provision, voting by voting groups may be required for one or more classes or series of shares of the surviving corporation as well as for one or more classes or series of the disappearing
                    corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.03(f)(2) requires voting by voting groups in a share exchange, with each class or series of shares that is to be acquired in a share exchange entitled to vote as a separate voting group. This provision protects all classes of shareholders when
                    more than one class or series of shares are being acquired on different terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a merger transaction that involves an increase in shares of more than 20 percent, section 11.03(g) requires a shareholder vote in order to prevent significant dilution without the approval of the shareholders involved. Sections 11.03(g)(3) and (4)
                    separately apply the 20-percent test to increases in the “voting shares” (as defined in section 11.03(h)(2)) and increases in “participating shares” (as defined in section 11.03(h)(1)). If either type of shares is increased by more
                    than 20 percent in the merger transaction, the transaction must be approved by the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the definitions in subsections (h)(1) and (2), the 20-percent requirement may be applied to shares with preferential rights if they are either voting or fully participating, and to deferred or contingent shares issued as a result of the merger.
                    On the other hand, it is typically not applicable to shares issuable under antidilution clauses to balance share splits or share dividends; these shares would not become issuable “pursuant to the merger,” but by virtue of later corporate
                    action authorizing the split or dividend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sections 11.03(g)(3) and (4) only determine when a shareholders’ vote is required; they do not relate to voting by voting groups. Whether or not a class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate voting group is determined by section 11.03(f).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.03(i) makes it clear that the corporations may abandon without shareholder approval a merger or share exchange even though it has been previously approved by the shareholders. Abandonment under this section does not affect contract rights of
                    third parties. The plan, however, may require that abandonments be approved by shareholders before they are effective.

       Amended North Carolina Commentary

                </p>
                <p>
                    This section essentially follows the same pattern as former G.S. 55-108 and 55-108.1, except it does not carry forward the provision in former G.S. 55-108(b) allowing nonvoting shareholders to vote on mergers. However, the corporation must give nonvoting
                    shareholders notice of the proposed shareholders’ meeting so that they can act if their rights will be adversely affected. The Model Act’s requirement that notice be given to nonvoting shareholders was retained in this section, in
                    contrast to G.S. 55-10-03, involving shareholders’ meetings to consider amendments to the articles of incorporation, because a proposed merger or share exchange is a fundamental change, whereas most amendments to the articles of incorporation
                    are not. It should be noted that the last sentence in the first section of the Official Comment is not correct for this Act. That sentence indicates that nonvoting shareholders have no right to dissent and obtain payment for their
                    shares in a merger or share exchange. G.S. 55-13-02(a)(1) and (2) give nonvoting shareholders this right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in G.S. 55-10-03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (e) by inserting between the word “incorporation” and the word “or” the words “a bylaw adopted by the shareholders.” This modification continues the existing concept of allowing a bylaw adopted by the shareholders
                    to impose a higher quorum or voting requirement. The subsection was further amended by inserting at the end a clause providing that for purposes of Article 9 or already existing provisions in articles of incorporation or bylaws, a
                    “merger” includes a share exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision 11.03(f)(1) of the Model Act requires voting by voting groups on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that “if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by one or more separate voting
                    groups on the proposed amendment.” Under this provision, voting by voting groups may be required for one or more classes or series of shares of the surviving corporation as well as for one or more classes or series of the disappearing
                    corporation. This provision was modified in subdivision (f)(1) to create an exception where the consideration to be received in exchange for the shares of the voting group consists solely of cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subdivision (f)(2) by substituting “to be acquired” for “included.”

                    incorporation to require shareholder approval of a merger for which G.S. 55-11-03(g) would not otherwise require shareholder approval, and (iii) to allow a plan of merger to be amended if the plan of merger makes provision for amendment.

                    Subsections (a) and (b) were amended and subsections (j) and (k) were added, effective October 1, 2018, to permit a public company target to enter into a “two-step” merger agreement, where the first step is a tender offer by the acquiror for the public
                    company shares and the second step is a merger in which the public company shares not tendered are converted into the same merger consideration offered in the tender offer. The provisions are based on 2016 changes to Model Act Subsections
                    11.04(b) and (j). Appraisal rights generally would not be available with respect to a merger involving public company shares pursuant to G.S. 55-13-02(b)(1), but if the transaction was an interested transaction, appraisal rights would
                    be available pursuant to G.S. 55-13-02(b)(4). Under the “two-step” merger agreement procedure, shareholders who do not tender their shares would have the same rights to seek appraisal under Article 13 of this Chapter that they would
                    in a merger that was approved at a meeting of shareholders.

                <p>
                    Section 11.04(a) defines a “parent” corporation as one that owns at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each class of another corporation, and a “subsidiary” corporation as one whose shares are so owned. Section 11.04 permits merger of a subsidiary
                    into its parent corporation upon adoption of a plan of merger by the board of directors of the parent alone. Separate action by the board of directors of the subsidiary is unnecessary because the share ownership of the parent corporation
                    is normally sufficient to permit it to elect or remove the subsidiary’s board of directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, the merger transaction need not be approved by the shareholders of either corporation. Approval by the shareholders of the subsidiary is meaningless because the parent’s share ownership is sufficient to ensure the plan will be approved. Approval
                    by the parent’s shareholders is also unnecessary because the transaction does not materially change their rights: the ownership of the parent corporation is being changed only from 90 percent indirect ownership to 100 percent direct
                    ownership of the same assets, and no significant amendment of the parent’s articles of incorporation is being made. For the same reason, shareholders of the parent corporation do not have the right to dissent from the transaction under
                    chapter 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minority shareholders of the subsidiary corporation may receive shares, obligations, or other securities of the parent or any other corporation, or cash or other property in whole or in part in exchange for their shares. These shareholders are entitled
                    to 30 days’ notice of the plan of merger before it is effectuated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shareholders of the subsidiary corporation have a right to dissent from the merger transaction under chapter 13. Courts have held that in some circumstances such a transaction may constitute a breach of duty owed by the parent corporation to the shareholders
                    of the subsidiary. See

                    This section is substantially different from former G.S. 55-108.1 in that it permits a parent corporation to merge a 90% subsidiary into the parent without a vote of the minority shareholders of the subsidiary; but such minority shareholders would still
                    have a right of dissent and appraisal.

                    waive approval by the subsidiary corporation’s board of directors unless the subsidiary corporation’s articles of incorporation require approval of the subsidiary corporation’s shareholders, and (iii) to require that notice of the
                    merger be given to the subsidiary corporation’s shareholders (if the shareholders are not required to approve the merger) within ten days after the merger instead of providing notice at least 30 days before the merger.

                    The articles of merger or share exchange formally make the terms of the transaction a matter of public record and the effective date of the articles is the effective date of their filing unless a delayed effective date is utilized. See section 1.23. The

                    Effective October 1, 2005, this section is amended to delete the requirement that the plan of merger or plan of share exchange be included in the articles of merger or articles of share exchange except that identifying information about the corporations
                    contained in the plan is required to be included in the articles plus, in the case of a merger, any amendments to the articles of incorporation of a surviving domestic corporation that are contained in the plan of merger. Other changes
                    to this section clarify its application to mergers of domestic nonprofit corporations, foreign business corporations, and foreign nonprofit corporations with domestic business corporations and to share exchanges with foreign business
                    corporations. In related changes, provisions requiring certain statements to be included in the articles of merger when a foreign business corporation or foreign nonprofit corporation is the surviving corporation are relocated to this
                    section from G.S. 55-11-07 and 55-11-09, and provisions requiring certain statements to be included in the articles of share exchange when a foreign business corporation is the acquiring corporation are relocated to this section from
                    G.S. 55-11-07.

                    Section 11.06 describes the legal consequences of a merger or share exchange on its effective date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.06(a) describes the effect of a merger. On the effective date every disappearing corporation that is a party to the merger disappears into the surviving corporation and the surviving corporation automatically becomes the owner of all real and
                    personal property and becomes subject to all liabilities, actual or contingent, of each disappearing corporation. A merger is not a conveyance or transfer, and does not give rise to claims of reverter or impairment of title based on
                    a prohibited conveyance or transfer. See section 11.06(a)(2). Further, all pending litigation is continued; the name of the surviving corporation may, but need not be, substituted for the name of a disappearing corporation that is
                    a party to litigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.06(a)(6) provides that if any shareholders to any party to the merger are to receive different shares or cash or property under the plan of merger, the rights of those shareholders after the articles of merger are filed are limited to their
                    rights under the plan of merger or their rights under chapter 13 of this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation are amended as provided in the plan of merger on the effective date of the merger. See section 11.06(a)(5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 11.06(b) describes the effect of a share exchange. On the effective date, the shareholders of the acquired class of shares cease to be shareholders of the acquired corporation. On that date they are entitled to receive only the consideration provided
                    in the plan of share exchange, or the rights of dissenting shareholders under chapter 13.

                    This section is identical to the comparable section of the Model Act, except for a minor modification to subdivision (a)(6). “Cash” in that subdivision was changed to “right to receive cash” and the word “thereupon” was added to clarify the meaning.

                <p>
                    Effective October 1, 2005, this section is changed to provide that any amendments to the articles of incorporation of a surviving domestic corporation must be set forth in the articles of merger because G.S. 55-11-05 (as amended effective October 1, 2005)
                    no longer requires the plan of merger to be included in the articles of merger. A provision is added stating that the merger does not affect the liability of a shareholder for obligations of a merging corporation incurred prior to
                    the merger. Other amendments to this section clarify its application to mergers of domestic nonprofit corporations, foreign business corporations, and foreign nonprofit corporations with domestic business corporations and to share
                    exchanges with foreign business corporations. In related changes, provisions applying when the surviving corporation in a merger is a foreign business corporation or foreign nonprofit corporation are relocated to this section from
                    G.S. 55-11-07 and 55-11-09, and provisions applying when the acquiring corporation in a share exchange is a foreign business corporation are relocated to this section from G.S. 55-11-07.

                        Lender’s successor’s evidence, including a letter from the Comptroller of the Currency officially certifying a merger between the successor and the lender, was sufficient to establish the merger. The successor, as the surviving corporation after the merger,

                    Section 11.07 permits mergers or share exchanges between domestic and foreign corporations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In connection with a plan of merger, the plan must be permitted under the law of the state or country of incorporation of the foreign corporation as well as under the law of the domestic state. The surviving corporation, if it is a foreign corporation,
                    must file articles of merger to accomplish the disappearance of the domestic corporation or corporations, and thereby irrevocably appoints the secretary of state as agent for service of process and agrees to pay dissenters in accordance
                    with chapter 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A plan of share exchange, unlike a plan of merger, need not be authorized by the state or country of incorporation of the acquiring foreign corporation. If the domestic law authorizes a compulsory share exchange to acquire a class or series of shares
                    of a domestic corporation, it makes no difference whether the acquiring corporation is foreign or domestic. This kind of transaction does not affect the separate corporate existence of, or impose the liabilities of the disappearing
                    corporation on, the acquiring foreign corporation.

                    Effective October 1, 2005, this section is amended to provide that if the corporation whose shares are to be acquired in a share exchange is a foreign business corporation, the laws of the state or country of incorporation of the foreign business corporation
                    must permit the share exchange and both the foreign business corporation and the acquiring domestic business corporation must comply with those laws. In the case of a merger involving a foreign business corporation, the merging domestic
                    business corporation must comply with the laws of the state or country of incorporation of the merging foreign business corporation to the extent applicable in addition to the merging foreign business corporation complying with those
                    laws. Other amendments reflect the relocation to G.S. 55-11-05 and 55-11-06 from this section of certain provisions applying if a foreign business corporation is the surviving corporation in a merger or the acquiring corporation in
                    a share exchange.

                    Under the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, the general rule is that a North Carolina corporation may merge with another corporation upon approval by the boards of directors and shareholders of each constituent corporation. However, where a parent
                    corporation holds at least 90% of each class of outstanding stock of a subsidiary corporation, the parent corporation and subsidiary corporation may merge without a vote of the board of directors or shareholders of the subsidiary and,
                    where the parent is the surviving corporation of the merger and its articles of incorporation are not being amended in connection with the merger, without a vote of the shareholders of the parent corporation. This simplified merger
                    approval process for 90% or more owned subsidiaries permitted by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is commonly referred to as a “Short-Form Merger.” This section was added, effective as of October 1, 2018, to extend the Short-Form
                    Merger process to any type of parent business entity.

                    A sale of “all or substantially all” the corporate assets in the regular course of business is governed by section 12.01. Mortgages of all of the corporation’s assets or redeployment of those assets through a wholly owned subsidiary are also covered by
                    section 12.01. All other sales of “all or substantially all” the corporate assets are governed by section 12.02. Dispositions or transfers of property that do not involve “all or substantially all” the property of the corporation are
                    not controlled by statute and may be approved by the board of directors (or authorized corporate officer) in the same manner as any other corporate transaction.

                    The phrase “all or substantially all,” chosen by the draftsmen of the Model Act, is intended to mean what it literally says, “all or substantially all.” The phrase “substantially all” is synonymous with “nearly all” and was added merely to make it clear
                    that the statutory requirements could not be avoided by retention of some minimal or nominal residue of the original assets. A sale of all the corporate assets other than cash or cash equivalents is normally the sale of “all or substantially
                    all” of the corporation’s property. A sale of several distinct manufacturing lines while retaining one or more lines is normally not a sale of “all or substantially all” even though the lines being sold are substantial and include
                    a significant fraction of the corporation’s former business. If the lines retained are viewed only as a temporary operation or as a pretext to avoid the “all or substantially all” requirements, however, the statutory requirements of
                    chapter 12 must be complied with. Similarly, a sale of a plant but retention of operating assets (e.g., machinery and equipment), accounts receivable, good will, and the like with a view toward continuing the operation at another location
                    is not a sale of “all or substantially all” the corporation’s property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some court decisions have adopted a narrower construction of somewhat similar statutory language. These decisions should be viewed as resting on the diverse statutory language involved in those cases and should not be viewed as illustrating the meaning
                    of “all or substantially all” intended by the draftsmen of the Model Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 12.01 describes transfers or dispositions of “all or substantially all” the corporate assets that do not require shareholder approval unless the articles of incorporation require it. These transactions consist of (1) mortgages or pledges of all
                    the corporation’s property, whether or not the loan they secure is in the ordinary course of business, (2) transactions within the usual and regular course of business, and (3) transfers to wholly owned subsidiaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mortgages or pledges of all the corporate assets may be demanded by lenders. They are essentially and substantively different from a sale or other disposition of assets even though they may take the form of a formal transfer of title to the mortgagee
                    for security purposes, or of a dedication of assets to the repayment of indebtedness, as in the case of oil and gas production payments. The corporation remains in possession of the mortgaged property, may continue to use it for corporate
                    purposes, in most cases must continue to manage the property, and may recover full title to the property by discharging the indebtedness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most transfers of “all or substantially all” the corporate property (as defined above) are, almost by definition, not in the usual and regular course of business; sales by real estate corporations and by corporations organized to liquidate a business
                    are examples of sales that may be included in this part of section 12.01(a). Typically, sales falling within the usual and regular course of business do not involve the sale of the corporate name or good will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 12.01 provides that a transfer of property to a wholly owned subsidiary does not require a vote of shareholders. This provision, however, may not be used as a device to avoid a vote of shareholders by a multiple-step transaction.

                    Subsection (a) is identical to former G.S. 55-112(a) and was substituted for the comparable provision in the Model Act (subdivision 12.01(a)(2)) to avoid an unintended implication that all mortgages or security interests require express approval by the
                    board of directors. Subsection (b) consists of subsection 12.01(a) of the Model Act, except for an introductory phrase taken from former G.S. 55-112(b) and the omission of the Model Act’s subdivision 12.01(a)(2). Because the Model
                    Act’s subsection 12.02(b) serves the same function as the language taken from former G.S. 55-112(b), that subsection was omitted.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope of the phrase “all or substantially all” is discussed in the Official Comment to section 12.01. All transactions that involve the sale or transfer of “all or substantially all” the corporate property must be approved by the shareholders unless
                    they fall within one of the exceptions of section 12.01.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 12.02 requires the board of directors to propose the sale and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. The board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the transaction be approved, unless the board determines that
                    because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, to the shareholders
                    when it presents the proposed sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proposed sale, to be approved, must receive the vote of a majority of the outstanding votes entitled by the articles of incorporation to be cast on the proposal. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under section 7.25. Nonvoting
                    classes of shares are not given a statutory right to vote on proposed sales (either as separate voting groups or together with voting shares) by the revised Model Act on the theory that classes or series of shares that are made nonvoting
                    by the articles of incorporation generally did not retain a voice in the areas of business the corporation may engage in the future. The articles of incorporation, however, may stipulate that specified classes or series of shares are
                    entitled to vote by separate voting groups. Thus, in the absence of special provision in the articles of incorporation, only the shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally by the articles of incorporation are entitled to
                    vote on sales of substantially all the assets of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may also specify that a greater percentage of votes is required to approve the proposal than specified in section 12.02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board of directors may condition its submission of a proposal to the shareholders under subsection (c) on any basis—for example, on its receiving a certain percentage of shareholders’ affirmative votes or that specified classes or series of shares,
                    voting by separate voting groups, must approve the transaction or on some other basis; see the discussion of conditional submissions in the Official Comment to section 10.03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The approval of most sales of “all or substantially all” of the corporation’s assets gives rise to dissenters’ rights under chapter 13 to shareholders who are entitled to vote on the transaction and avail themselves of the procedures described in that
                    chapter. Sales subject to section 12.02 that do not give rise to dissenters’ rights even for voting shares include (1) sales pursuant to a court order and (2) sales that require all or substantially all of the net proceeds to be distributed
                    to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after the date of sale. See section 13.02. Shares not entitled to vote on the transaction do not have dissenters’ rights by statute; the articles of
                    incorporation may grant those rights or the board of directors may elect to make them available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 12.02(f) authorizes a board of directors to abandon a proposed sale without shareholder approval after it has been previously approved by the shareholders. An abandonment does not affect contractual rights that third persons may have against the
                    corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain corporate divisions, often called “spin offs,” “split offs,” or “split ups,” sometimes involve transactions that may be formally characterized as sales of “all or substantially all” the corporate assets when in fact they are only a step in a corporate
                    division that does not give rise to the problem of a major change in corporate direction and therefore does not need shareholder approval. Section 12.02(g) is designed to make clear that transactions like this, which actually constitute
                    a distribution, are not subject to section 12.02. See Siegal, “When Corporations Divide: A Statutory and Financial Analysis,” 79 HARV. L. REV. 534 (1966).

                    The Model Act’s subsection 12.02(a) provides that a corporation may sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of its property “(with or without the good will).” Because the drafters believed that the language in parentheses
                    is unclear and probably adds nothing to the subsection, it was not included in subsection (a).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in G.S. 55-10-03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase “a bylaw adopted by the shareholders” was inserted in subsection (e) to preserve the practice under prior law.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> deals with the tension between the desire of the corporate leadership to be able to enter new fields, acquire new enterprises, and rearrange
                        investor rights, and the desire of investors to adhere to the rights and the risks on the basis of which they invested. Contemporary corporation statutes in the United States attempt to resolve this tension through a combination
                        of two devices. On the one hand, through their approval of an amendment to the articles of incorporation, a merger, share exchange or disposition of assets, the majority may change the nature and shape of the enterprise and the
                        rights of all its shareholders. On the other hand, shareholders who object to these changes may withdraw the fair value of their investment in cash through their exercise of appraisal rights.

                        The traditional accommodation has been sharply criticized from two directions. From the viewpoint of investors who object to the transaction, the appraisal process is criticized for providing little help to the ordinary investor because its technicalities
                        make its use difficult, expensive, and risky. From the viewpoint of the corporate leadership, the appraisal process is criticized because it fails to protect the corporation from demands that are motivated by the hope of a nuisance
                        settlement or by fanciful conceptions of value. See generally Bayless Manning, “The Shareholders’ Appraisal Remedy: An Essay for Frank Coker,” 72 Yale L.J. 223 (1962).

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> is a compromise between these opposing points of view. It is designed to increase the frequency with which assertion of appraisal rights
                        leads to economical and satisfying solutions, and to decrease the frequency with which such assertion leads to delay, expense, and dissatisfaction. It seeks to achieve these goals primarily by simplifying and clarifying the appraisal
                        process, as well as by motivating the parties to settle their differences in private negotiations without resort to judicial appraisal proceedings.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> proceeds from the premise that judicial appraisal should be provided by statute only when two conditions co-exist. First, the proposed
                        corporate action as approved by the majority will result in a fundamental change in the shares to be affected by the action. Second, uncertainty concerning the fair value of the affected shares may cause reasonable persons to differ
                        about the fairness of the terms of the corporate action. Uncertainty is greatly reduced, however, in the case of publicly-traded shares. This explains both the market exception described below and the limits provided to the exception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appraisal rights in connection with mergers and share exchanges under chapter 11 and dispositions of assets requiring shareholder approval under chapter 12 are provided when these two conditions co-exist. Each of these actions will result in a fundamental
                        change in the shares that a disapproving shareholder may feel was not adequately compensated by the terms approved by the majority. Except for shareholders of a subsidiary corporation that is merged under section 11.05 (the “short-form”
                        merger), only those shareholders who are entitled to vote on a transaction are entitled to appraisal rights. The linkage between voting and appraisal rights is justified because the right to a shareholder vote is a good proxy for
                        assessing the seriousness of the change contemplated by the corporate action. This is especially true where the action triggers group-voting provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding this linkage, amended chapter 13 eliminates appraisal for voting shareholders in several instances where it would have been available under the 1984 Act. Shareholders who are entitled to vote on a corporate action, whether because such
                        shareholders have general voting rights or because group voting provisions are triggered, are not entitled to appraisal if the change will not alter the terms of the class or series of securities that they hold. Thus, statutory
                        appraisal rights are not available for shares of any class of the surviving corporation in a merger or any class of shares that is not included in a share exchange. Appraisal is also not triggered by a voluntary dissolution under
                        chapter 14 because that action does not affect liquidation rights — the only rights that are relevant following a shareholder vote to dissolve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the exception of reverse stock splits that result in cashing out some of the shares of a class or series, amended chapter 13 also eliminates appraisal in connection with all amendments to the articles of incorporation. This change in amended chapter
                        13 does not reflect a judgment that an amendment changing the terms of a particular class or series may not have significant economic effects. Rather, it reflects a judgment that distinguishing among different types of amendments
                        for the purposes of statutory appraisal is necessarily arbitrary and thus may not accurately reflect the actual demand of shareholders for appraisal in specific instances. Instead, amended chapter 13 permits a high degree of private-ordering
                        by delineating a list of transactions for which the corporation may voluntarily choose to provide appraisal and by permitting a provision in the articles of incorporation that eliminates, in whole or in part, statutory appraisal
                        rights for preferred shares.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> also is unique in its approach to appraisal rights for publicly-traded shares. Approximately half of the general corporation statutes
                        in the United States provide exceptions to appraisal for publicly-traded shares, on the theory that it is not productive to expose the corporation to the time, expense and cash drain imposed by appraisal demands when shareholders
                        who are dissatisfied with the consideration offered in an appraisal-triggering transaction could sell their shares and obtain cash from the market. This exception to appraisal is generally known as the “market-out” and is referred
                        to here as the “market exception.” Opponents of the market exception argue that it results in unfairness where neither the consideration offered in connection with the transaction nor the market price reflects the fair value of
                        the shares, particularly if the corporate decision-makers have a conflict of interest.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> seeks to accommodate both views by providing a market exception that is limited to those situations where shareholders are likely to
                        receive fair value when they sell their shares in the market after the announcement of an appraisal-triggering transaction. For the market exception to apply under chapter 13, there must first be a liquid market. Second, unique
                        to chapter 13, the market exception does not apply in specified circumstances where the appraisal-triggering action is deemed to be a conflict-of-interest transaction.

                        The definition of “beneficial shareholder” means a person who owns the beneficial interest in shares; “shares” is defined in section 1.40(22) to include, without limitation, a holder of a depository receipt for shares. Similar definitions are found in
                        section 7.40(2) (derivative proceedings) and section 16.02(f) (inspection of records by a shareholder). In the context of chapter 13, beneficial shareholder means a person having a direct economic interest in the shares. The definition
                        is not intended to adopt the broad definition of beneficial ownership in SEC Rule 13d-2, which includes persons with a right to vote or dispose of the shares even though they have no economic interest in them. However, section
                        13.02(b)(5) includes the concept of the right to vote in determining whether the event represents a conflict transaction that renders the market exception unavailable.

                        The definition of “corporation”” in section 13.01(3) includes, for purposes of the post-transaction matters covered in section 13.22 through 13.31, a successor entity in a merger where the corporation is not the surviving entity. The definition does not
                        include a domestic acquiring corporation in a share exchange or disposition of assets because the corporation whose shares or assets were acquired continues in existence in both of these instances and remains responsible for the
                        appraisal obligations. Whether a foreign corporation or other form of domestic or foreign entity is subject to appraisal rights in connection with any of these transactions depends upon the corporation or other applicable law of
                        the relevant jurisdiction.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (i) of the definition of “fair value” in section 13.01(4) makes clear that fair value is to be determined immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action, rather than, as is the case under most state statutes that address the issue,
                        the date of the shareholders’ vote. This comports with the purpose of this chapter to preserve the shareholder’s prior rights as a shareholder until the effective date of the corporate action, rather than leaving the shareholder
                        in an ambiguous state with neither rights as a shareholder nor perfected appraisal rights. The corporation and, as relevant, its shares are valued as they exist immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action requiring
                        appraisal. Accordingly, section 13.01(4) permits consideration of changes in the market price of the corporation’s shares in anticipation of the transaction, to the extent such changes are relevant. Similarly, in a two-step transaction
                        culminating in a merger, the corporation is valued immediately before the second step merger, taking into account any interim changes in value.

                        The definition of “fair value” in section 13.01(4) makes several changes from the prior version. The 1984 Model Act’s definition of “fair value” was silent on how fair value was to be determined, except for a concluding clause that excluded from the valuation
                        “any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action, unless exclusion would be inequitable.” The Official Comment provided that the section left to the courts “the details by which ‘fair value’ is to be determined
                        within the broad outlines of the definition.” While the logic of the prior Official Comment continues to apply, the exclusionary clause in the prior Model Act definition, including the qualification for cases where the exclusion
                        would be inequitable, has been deleted. Those provisions have not been susceptible to meaningful judicial interpretation and have been set aside in favor of the broader concept in subsection (ii).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new formulation in paragraph (ii), which is patterned on section 7.22 of the Principles of Corporate Governance promulgated by the American Law Institute, directs courts to keep the methodology chosen in appraisal proceedings consistent with evolving
                        economic concepts and adopts that part of section 7.22 which provides that fair value should be determined using “customary valuation concepts and techniques generally employed . . . for similar businesses in the context of the
                        transaction requiring appraisal.” Subsection (ii) adopts the accepted view that different transactions and different contexts may warrant different valuation methodologies. Customary valuation concepts and techniques will typically
                        take into account numerous relevant factors, including assigning a higher valuation to corporate assets that would be more productive if acquired in a comparable transaction but excluding any element of value attributable to the
                        unique synergies of the actual purchaser of the corporation or its assets. For example, if the corporation’s assets include undeveloped real estate that is located in a prime commercial area, the court should consider the value
                        that would be attributed to the real estate as commercial development property in a comparable transaction. The court should not, however, assign any additional value based upon the specific plans or special use of the actual purchaser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern valuation methods will normally result in a range of values, not a particular single value. When a transaction falls within that range, “fair value” has been established. Absent unusual circumstances, it is expected that the consideration in an
                        arm’s-length transaction will fall within the range of “fair value” for purposes of section 13.01(4). Section 7.22 of the ALI Principles of Corporate Governance also provides that in situations that do not involve certain types
                        of specified conflicts of interest, “the aggregate price accepted by the board of directors of the subject corporation should be presumed to represent the fair value of the corporation, or of the assets sold in the case of an asset
                        sale, unless the plaintiff can prove otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.” That presumption has not been included in the definition of “fair value” in section 13.01(4) because the framework of defined types of conflict transactions
                        which is a predicate for the ALI”s presumption is not contained in the Model Act. Nonetheless, under section 13.01(4), a court determining fair value should give great deference to the aggregate consideration accepted or approved
                        by a disinterested board of directors for an appraisal-triggering transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (iii) of the definition of “fair value” establishes that valuation discounts for lack of marketability or minority status are inappropriate in most appraisal actions, both because most transactions that trigger appraisal rights affect the corporation
                        as a whole and because such discounts give the majority the opportunity to take advantage of minority shareholders who have been forced against their will to accept the appraisal-triggering transaction. Subsection (iii), in conjunction
                        with the lead-in language to the definition, is also designed to adopt the more modern view that appraisal should generally award a shareholder his or her proportional interest in the corporation after valuing the corporation as
                        a whole, rather than the value of the shareholder’s shares when valued alone. If, however, the corporation voluntarily grants appraisal rights for transactions that do not affect the entire corporation — such as certain amendments
                        to the articles of incorporation — the court should use its discretion in applying discounts if appropriate. As the introductory clause of section 13.01 notes, the definition of “fair value” applies only to chapter 13. See the
                        Official Comment to section 14.34 which recognizes that a minority discount may be appropriate under that section.

                    <p>
                        The definition of “interest” in section 13.01(5) is included to apprise the parties of their respective rights and obligations. The right to receive interest is based on the elementary consideration that the corporation, rather than the shareholder demanding
                        appraisal, has the use of the shareholder’s money from the effective date of the corporate action (when those shareholders who do not demand appraisal rights have the right to receive their consideration from the transaction) until
                        the date of payment. Section 13.01(5) thus requires interest to be paid at the rate of interest on judgments from the effective date of the corporate action until the date of payment. The specification of the rate of interest on
                        judgments, rather than a more subjective rate, eliminates a possible issue of contention and should facilitate voluntary settlements. Each state determines whether interest is compound or simple.

                        The definition of “shareholder” in section 13.01(9) for purposes of chapter 13 differs from the definition of that term used elsewhere in the Model Act. Section 1.40(21) defines “shareholder” as used generally in the Act to mean only a “record shareholder”;
                        that term is specifically defined in section 13.01(7). Section 13.01(9), on the other hand, defines “shareholder” to include not only a “record shareholder” but also a “beneficial shareholder,” a term that is itself defined in
                        section 13.01(2). The specially defined terms “record shareholder” and “beneficial shareholder” appear primarily in section 13.03, which establishes the manner in which beneficial shareholders, and record shareholders who are acting
                        on behalf of beneficial shareholders, perfect appraisal rights. The word “shareholder” is used generally throughout chapter 13 in order to permit both record and beneficial shareholders to take advantage of the provisions of this
                        chapter, subject to their fulfilling the applicable requirements of this chapter.

                        Section 13.02(a) establishes the scope of appraisal rights by identifying those transactions which afford this right. In view of the significant degree of private ordering permitted by section 13.02(a)(5), the scope of statutory appraisal provided is
                        somewhat narrower than that provided in the 1984 Model Act. As discussed in the first section of the Official Comment to section 13.01, statutory appraisal is made available only for corporate actions that will result in a fundamental
                        change in the shares to be affected by the action and then only when uncertainty concerning the fair value of the affected shares may cause reasonable differences about the fairness of the terms of the corporate action. The transactions
                        that satisfy both of these criteria are:

                            and to appraisal under section 13.02(a)(1). Although shareholders of a subsidiary that is a party to a merger under section 11.05 are not entitled to a vote, they are entitled to appraisal under 13.02(a)(1) because their interests
                            will be extinguished by the merger. Section 13.02(a)(1)(i) denies appraisal rights to any class or series of shares in the surviving corporation if such class or series remains outstanding.

                            A disposition of assets requiring shareholder approval under section 12.02. Minimally, shareholders of all classes or series of the corporation that are generally entitled to vote on matters requiring shareholder approval will be entitled to assert appraisal
                            rights. Whether shares of a class or series that do not have general voting rights will be entitled to vote on the asset disposition and thus become entitled to appraisal rights depends on the form of the transaction disposing
                            of the corporation’s assets. In the usual form of this transaction, which is governed by chapter 12, the acquirer purchases substantially all of the assets and assumes substantially all of the liabilities of the corporation,
                            which then liquidates pursuant to a plan of dissolution approved by the shareholders as part of the transaction and distributes the consideration received from the acquirer to its shareholders. If the transaction provides a
                            non-voting class of preferred with its liquidation preference, there is no change in the contractual terms of the preferred and it is entitled neither to vote nor to appraisal rights. By the same token, a preferred class cannot
                            be required to accept any consideration different from that called for in its liquidation preference without amending the terms of the class. For example, a plan that called for the preferred to accept securities of the acquirer
                            in lieu of its cash liquidation preference would trigger both group voting and appraisal rights on behalf of the class. In the unusual event that the asset disposition plan contemplated that the corporation would continue in
                            existence, the terms of a nonvoting class would not have been changed as a result of the transaction, and appraisal rights would not be available. As provided in section 12.02(g), a disposition of assets by a corporation in
                            the course of dissolution under chapter 14 is governed by that chapter, not chapter 12, and thus does not implicate appraisal rights.

                            Amendments to the articles of incorporation that effectuate a reverse stock split which reduces the number of shares that a shareholder owns of a class or series to a fractional share if the corporation has the obligation or right to repurchase the fractional
                            share so created. The reasons for granting appraisal rights in this situation are similar to those granting such rights in cases of cash-out mergers, as both transactions could compel affected shareholders to accept cash for
                            their investment in an amount established by the corporation. Appraisal is afforded only for those shareholders of a class or series whose interest is so affected.

                            Any other merger, share exchange, disposition of assets or amendment to the articles to the extent the articles, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors grants appraisal rights to a particular class or series of stock. A corporation may voluntarily
                            wish to grant to the holders of one or more of its classes or series of shares appraisal rights in connection with these important transactions whenever the Act does not provide statutory appraisal rights. The grant of appraisal
                            rights may satisfy shareholders who might, in the absence of appraisal rights, seek other remedies. Moreover, in situations where the existence of appraisal rights may otherwise be disputed, the voluntary offer of those rights
                            under this section may avoid litigation. Obviously, an express grant of voluntary appraisal rights under section 13.02(a)(5) is intended to override any of the exceptions to the availability of appraisal rights in section 13.02(a).
                            Any voluntary grant of appraisal rights by the corporation to the holders of one or more of its classes or series of shares will thereby automatically make all of the provisions of chapter 13 applicable to the corporation and
                            such holders regarding this corporate action.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> provides a limited exception to appraisal rights for those situations where shareholders can either accept the consideration offered
                        in the appraisal-triggering transaction or can obtain the fair value of their shares by selling them in the market. This provision is predicated on the theory that where an efficient market exists, the market price will be an adequate
                        proxy for the fair value of the corporation’s shares, thus making appraisal unnecessary. Furthermore, after the corporation announces an appraisal-triggering action, the market operates at maximum efficiency with respect to that
                        corporation’s shares because interested parties and market professionals evaluate the offer and competing offers may be generated if the original offer is deemed inadequate.

                    <p>
                        Moreover, the market exception reflects an evaluation that the uncertainty, costs and time commitment involved in any appraisal proceeding are not warranted where shareholders can sell their shares in an efficient, fair and liquid market. For these reasons,
                        approximately half of the states have enacted market exceptions to their appraisal statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For purposes of this chapter, the market exception is provided for a class or series if two criteria are met: the market in which the class or series is traded must be “liquid” and the value of the shares established by the appraisal-triggering event
                        must be “reliable.” Liquidity is defined in section 13.02(b)(1) and requires the class or series of stock to satisfy either of two requirements: the class or series is either listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American
                        Stock Exchange or is designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or, although not so listed or designated, the class or series has
                        at least 2,000 record or beneficial shareholders, provided that using both concepts does not result in duplication. In this instance, the outstanding class or series must also have a market value of at least $20 million, excluding
                        the value of shares held by the corporation’s subsidiaries, senior executives, directors and beneficial shareholders owning more than 10 percent of the class or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because section 13.02(b)(3) excludes from the market exception those transactions that require shareholders to accept anything other than cash or securities that also meet the liquidity tests of section 13.02(b)(1), shareholders are assured of receiving
                        either appraisal rights, cash from the transaction, or shares or other proprietary interests in the survivor entity that are liquid. Section 13.02(b)(2) provides that the corporation generally must satisfy the requirements of section
                        13.02(b)(1) on the record date for a shareholder vote on the appraisal-triggering transaction. For purposes of subsection 13.02(a)(1)(ii), the requirements of section 13.02(b)(1) must be met as of the day before the corporate action
                        becomes effective.

                        The premise of the market exception is that the market must be liquid and the valuation assigned to the relevant shares must be “reliable.” Section 13.02(b)(1) is designed to assure liquidity. For purposes of these provisions, section 13.02(b)(4) is designed
                        to assure reliability by recognizing that the market price of, or consideration for, shares of a corporation that proposes to engage in a section 13.02(a) transaction may be subject to influences where a corporation’s management,
                        controlling shareholders or directors have conflicting interests that could, if not dealt with appropriately, adversely affect the consideration that otherwise could have been expected. Section 13.02(b)(4) addresses two groups
                        of conflict transactions: those in clause (i), which involve controlling shareholders; and those in clause (ii), which involve senior executives and directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(b)(4)(i) covers two possible conflict situations: subsection (A) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by a shareholder or an affiliate of the shareholder that could be considered controlling by virtue
                        of ownership of a substantial amount of voting stock (20 percent); and subsection (B) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by an individual or group, or by an affiliate of such individual or
                        group, that has the ability to exercise control, through contract, stock ownership, or some other means, over at least one fourth of the board’s membership. The definition of “beneficial owner” in section 13.02(b)(5) serves to
                        identify possible conflict situations by deeming each member of a group that agrees to vote in tandem to be a beneficial owner of all the voting shares owned by the group. In contrast, the term “beneficial shareholder,” as defined
                        in section 13.01(2), is used to identify those persons entitled to appraisal rights. The last portion of subsection (A) recognizes that an acquisition effected in two steps (a tender offer followed by a merger) within one year,
                        where the two steps are either on the same terms or the second step is on terms that are more favorable to target shareholders, is properly considered a single transaction for purposes of identifying conflict transactions, regardless
                        of whether the second-step merger is governed by sections 11.04 or 11.05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(b)(4)(ii) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by a person, or an affiliate of a person, who is, or in the year leading up to the transaction was, a senior executive or director of the corporation. The
                        section eliminates the market exception for management buyouts because participation in the buyout group is itself “a financial benefit not available to other shareholders as such.” The market exception is also not available for
                        transactions involving other types of economic benefits (in addition to benefits afforded to shareholders generally, as such) afforded to senior executives (as defined in section 13.01(8)) and directors in specified conflict situations,
                        unless specific objective or procedural standards are met. Section 13.01(1) specially defines the term “affiliate” for purposes of section 13.02(b)(4) to include an entity of which a person is a senior executive. Due to this specialized
                        definition, if a senior executive of the corporation is to continue and is to receive enumerated employment and other financial benefits after the transaction, the availability of the market exception will depend on meeting one
                        of the three conditions specified in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of section 13.02(b)(4)(ii).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, under section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(A), the market exception is not lost if financial benefits that result from the transaction consist of employment, consulting, retirement or similar benefits established separately and not in contemplation of the transaction.
                        For example, if an individual has an arrangement under which benefits will be triggered on a “change of control,” such as accelerated vesting of options, retirement benefits, deferred compensation and similar items, or is afforded
                        the opportunity to retire or leave the employ of the enterprise with more favorable economic results than would be the case absent a change of control, the existence of these arrangements would not disqualify the transaction from
                        the market exception if the arrangements had been established as a general condition of the individual’s employment or continued employment, rather than in contemplation of the particular transaction. Second, under section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(B),
                        if such arrangements are established as part of, or as a condition of, the transaction, the market exception will not be lost if the arrangements are either not more favorable than those already in existence or, if more favorable,
                        are approved by “qualified” directors (
                        <i>
        i.e.
       </i> , meeting the standard of independence specified in section 8.62(d)), in the same manner as is provided for conflicting interest transactions generally with the corporation under section 8.62. This category would include
                        arrangements with the corporation which have been negotiated as part of, or as a condition of, the transaction or arrangements with the acquiring company or one or more of its other subsidiaries. The third situation, delineated
                        in section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(C), addresses a person who is a director of the issuer and, in connection with the transaction, is to become a director of the acquiring entity or its parent, or to continue as a director of the corporation
                        when it becomes a subsidiary of the acquiring entity. In this situation, the market exception is not lost as long as that person will not be treated more favorably as a director than are other persons who are serving in the same
                        director positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(c) permits the corporation to eliminate or limit appraisal rights for the holders of one or more series or classes of preferred shares. The operative provisions may be set forth in the corporation’s articles of incorporation as originally
                        filed or in any amendment thereto, but any such amendment will not become effective for one year with respect to outstanding shares or shares which the corporation is or may be required to issue or sell at some later date pursuant
                        to any rights outstanding prior to such amendment becoming effective. Shareholders who have not yet acquired, or do not have a right to acquire from the corporation, any shares of preferred stock, should have the ability either
                        not to acquire any shares of preferred stock or to have appraisal rights granted or restored for such shares, if such shareholders so desire, before purchasing them. In contrast, because the terms of common shares are rarely negotiated,
                        section 13.02 does not permit the corporation to eliminate or limit the appraisal rights of common shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With two exceptions, section 13.02(d) provides that the appraisal is the exclusive remedy for corporate action that has been completed. The theory underlying this section is that when a majority of shareholders has approved a corporate change, the corporation
                        should be permitted to proceed even if a minority considers the change unwise or disadvantageous. The very existence of the appraisal remedy recognizes that shareholders may disagree about the value of consequences of a corporate
                        action and that some may hold such strong views that they will want to vindicate them in a judicial proceeding. Since a judicial proceeding is insulated from the dynamics of an actual negotiation, it is not surprising that the
                        two processes could produce different valuations. Accordingly, if such a proceeding results in an award of additional consideration to the shareholders who pursued appraisal, no inference should be drawn that the judgment of the
                        majority was wrong or that compensation is now owed to shareholders who did not seek appraisal. Thus, an exclusivity principle is generally justified. Nevertheless, there may be exceptional circumstances where the process by which
                        the corporate action was approved was so flawed that it is appropriate to provide more general relief on behalf of all affected shareholders. Thus, section 13.02(d)(1) does not preclude challenges to serious procedural defects
                        in approving the action, such as a failure to obtain the votes required by statute or by the corporation’s own articles, bylaws, or board resolution authorizing the transaction. Similarly, subsection (2) creates an exception for
                        cases where fraud or material misrepresentation have affected the shareholder vote to such an extent as to have caused the corporate action to be approved mistakenly. The concept of misrepresentation includes the omission of a
                        material fact necessary to make statements made not misleading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although section 13.02(d) does not address the question of remedies, such as injunctive relief, that may be available before the corporate action is effected, it should be noted that a complaint based solely on adequacy of consideration is not actionable
                        unless accompanied by credible allegations of wrongdoing. Section 13.02(d) is concerned with challenges only to the corporate action and does not address remedies, if any, that shareholders may have against directors or other persons
                        as a result of the corporate action. See section 8.31 and Official Comment.

                        Subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) give a right of dissent for all shares, whether voting or nonvoting, in the case of a merger or sale or exchange of assets; the corresponding provisions in the Model Act give the right of dissent only to voting
                        shareholders.

                    <p>
                        The right of dissent under this section, however, does not apply in a merger to shares of a corporation when approval by the shareholders of that corporation is not required under G.S. 55-11-03(g) or to shares of a parent corporation in a merger under
                        G.S. 55-11-04. In addition, the right of dissent does not apply in a merger or share exchange to shares that are redeemable by the corporation at the time of the transaction at a price not greater than the cash to be received in
                        exchange for such shares. The Model Act was modified in clause (i) of subdivision (a)(1) to clarify that the absence of a right of dissent applies only to the shares of the corporation covered by G.S. 55-11-03(g) and not to shares
                        of a corporation if approval by its shareholders is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was also modified in subdivision (a)(3) to provide that a right of dissent will not be available if the sale of property is pursuant to a plan by which all or substantially all of the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed in cash
                        to the shareholders within one year after the date of the sale. This is different from the Model Act, which requires the sale itself to be in cash. This subdivision thus allows more flexibility in permitting, for example, the sale
                        to be for promissory notes or other property that will be converted to cash for distribution within the one-year period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The language of the Model Act which excepts from the operation of the section “a limitation by dilution through issuance of shares or other securities with similar voting rights” was eliminated from the end of clause (iv) of subdivision (a)(4). The only
                        reason for this elimination was the drafters’ opinion that the language is unnecessary; if it were necessary, it should also have been added to the end of G.S. 55-10-04(a)(4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clause (vi) of subdivision (a)(4), which is not in the Model Act, brings forward the same provisions in former G.S. 55-101(b). However, the drafters decided not to bring forward the unusual provision in former G.S. 55-102(a) that gave a right of dissent
                        to the holders of any class of preferred shares with dividend arrearages if the corporation offered to exchange such shares for shares with a prior preference and that offer was accepted by any of the preferred shareholders. Such
                        a situation may be covered by clause (i) of subdivision (a)(4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The introductory language of subsection 13.02(a) of the Model Act was modified to provide that the rights provided by this section are in addition to any rights provided by Article 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By making the appraisal remedy exclusive unless the transaction is “unlawful” or “fraudulent,” subsection (b) effects a change from former G.S. 55-113(b), which provided that such remedy was “in addition to any other right [the shareholder] may have in
                        law or in equity.”

                    <p>
                        Language was added to the Model Act provision to make it clear that subsection (b) covers a cash merger and that, in determining whether a merger was “unlawful” or “fraudulent,” the same standard applies, regardless of whether the consideration received
                        was cash, other property, or shares of a surviving corporation.

                        whether voting or non-voting, in such transactions. Subdivision (d), which is not in the Model Act, grandfathers the appraisal rights of a shareholder holding shares of a class or series that were issued and outstanding as of the
                        effective date of the Act but that did not as of that date entitle the shareholder to vote on a corporate action described in subdivision (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section; such shareholder shall be entitled to appraisal rights
                        to the same extent as if such shares did entitle the shareholder to vote on such corporate action.

                        Corporations are afforded flexibility under Article 13 to deviate from the specified corporate actions that give rise to appraisal rights and the shareholders entitled to such rights. Under subdivision (a)(5) appraisal rights can be extended to any shareholders
                        in connection with any amendment to the articles of incorporation, merger, share exchange or disposition of assets to the extent provided in the articles, bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors.

                        Effective as of October 1, 2018, this section was amended to provide appraisal rights to voting and non-voting shareholders on an equal basis, including (i) to minority shareholders of a subsidiary corporation in a short-form merger with an unincorporated
                        parent company under G.S. 55-11-12, and (ii) to non-tendering shareholders in second-step mergers following a tender offer in which offeror gains control under G.S. 55-11-03(j).

                        Dissent and appraisal was the exclusive remedy for shareholders aggrieved by the price offered and the method by which the price was set in a cash-out merger of a North Carolina corporation; where a minority shareholder’s complaint centered around an

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.03 addresses the relationship between those who are entitled to assert appraisal rights and the widespread practice of nominee or street name ownership of publicly-held shares. Generally, a shareholder must demand appraisal for all the shares
                        of a class or series which the shareholder owns. If a record shareholder is a nominee for several beneficial shareholders, some of whom wish to demand appraisal and some of whom do not, section 13.03(a) permits the record shareholder
                        to assert appraisal rights with respect to a portion of the shares held of record by the record shareholder but only with respect to all the shares beneficially owned by a single person. This limitation is necessary to prevent
                        abuse by a single beneficial shareholder who is not fundamentally opposed to the proposed corporate action but who may wish to speculate on the appraisal process, as to some of that shareholder’s shares, on the possibility of a
                        high payment. On the other hand, a shareholder who owns shares in more than one class or series may assert appraisal rights for only some but not all classes or series that the shareholder owns. This is permitted because fair treatment
                        of one class or series does not guarantee fair treatment of other classes or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.03(a) also requires a record shareholder who demands appraisal with respect to a portion of the shares held by the record shareholder to notify the corporation of the name and address of the beneficial owner on whose behalf the record shareholder
                        has demanded appraisal rights.

                    <p>
                        Section 13.03(b) permits a beneficial shareholder to assert appraisal rights directly if the beneficial shareholder submits the record shareholder’s written consent. Although generally the record shareholder is treated as the owner of shares, this section
                        recognizes that sometimes the record shareholders are holding shares on behalf of beneficial shareholders. It would be foreign to the premises underlying nominee and street name ownership to require these record shareholders to
                        forward demands and participate in litigation on behalf of their clients. In order to make appraisal rights effective without burdening record shareholders, beneficial shareholders should be allowed to assert their own claims as
                        provided in this subsection. The beneficial shareholder is required to submit, no later than the date specified in section 13.22(b)(2)(ii), a written consent by the record shareholder to the assertion of appraisal rights to verify
                        the beneficial shareholder’s entitlement and to permit the protection of any security interest in the shares. In practice, a broker’s customer who wishes to assert appraisal rights may request the broker to supply the customer
                        with the name of the record shareholder (which may be a house nominee or a nominee of the Depository Trust Company), and a form of consent signed by the record shareholder. At the same time, the customer may want to obtain certificates
                        for the shares so that they may be deposited pursuant to section 13.23. After the corporation has received the form of consent, the corporation must deal with the beneficial shareholder.

                        The drafters did not include the language at the end of subsection 13.03(b)(3) of the Model Act requiring a beneficial owner to dissent with respect to all shares “over which he has power to direct the vote” because they concluded that it could be construed
                        to include shares which that person did not own either as beneficial or record holder but for which he or she was a proxy or could exercise a power of attorney. That result was not deemed desirable.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Before a vote is taken on a corporate action, the corporation is required by section 13.20(a) to notify record shareholders that a transaction is proposed and that the corporation has concluded either that appraisal rights are or are not available; alternatively,
                        if the corporation is unsure about the availability of appraisal rights, it may state that appraisal rights may be available. Notice of appraisal rights is needed because many shareholders do not know what appraisal rights they
                        may have or how to assert them. If the corporation has concluded appraisal rights are or may be available, the notice must be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.20(b) provides that notice be given by the parent corporation within ten days after the effective date of a merger of its subsidiary under section 11.05. This notice may be combined with the notice required by section 13.22.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This section adds to the Model Act’s provisions the 10-day requirement in subsection (b) and the new subsection (c). A similar 10-day requirement is included in G.S. 55-13-22(b) and in section 13.22(b) of the Model Act. The new subsection (c) was adapted
                        from former G.S. 55-113(f), except that the period within which the damage action may be brought was increased from one to three years, thus increasing the burden on the corporation to comply with the statute. The shareholder must
                        bring the damage action “in his own name,” and not as a class or derivative action.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT

                    <p>
                        Section 13.21 applies to all transactions requiring appraisal, except short-form mergers under section 11.05. In the latter case, shareholders of the subsidiary do not vote on the transaction but are nevertheless entitled to appraisal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.21(a) requires the shareholder to give notice of an intent to demand payment before the vote on the corporate action is taken. This notice enables the corporation to determine how much of a cash payment may be required. It also serves to limit
                        the number of persons to whom the corporation must give further notice during the remainder of the appraisal process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order for a shareholder to remain eligible to demand payment, section 13.21(a)(2) mandates that the shareholder must not vote (or, in the case of a beneficial shareholder, cause or permit to be voted) any shares of any class or series for which the
                        shareholder is demanding appraisal in favor of the proposal.

                        Effective as of October 1, 2018, this section was amended to facilitate the determination of how much of a cash payment may be required by the exercise of appraisal rights upon closing a corporate action that is approved by shareholder written consent.
                        The amendments provide that the shareholder must provide a notice of intent to demand an appraisal rights payment before the corporate action becomes effective provided notice of the corporate action was given to the shareholder
                        at least 25 days before the effective time. The amendments also provide procedures for exercising appraisal rights to non-tendering shareholders in second-step mergers following a tender offer in which offeror gains control under
                        G.S. 55-11-03(j).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 13.22 is to require the corporation to provide shareholders with information and a form for perfecting appraisal rights. The content of this notice and form are spelled out in detail to ensure that they accomplish this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an action is submitted to the vote of shareholders, the appraisal notice must be sent only to those persons who gave notice of their intention to demand appraisal under section 13.21 and did not vote (or permit or cause to be voted) such shares in
                        favor of the proposed action. In a short-form merger under section 11.05, the notice must be sent to all persons who may be eligible for appraisal rights no earlier than the effective date of the merger and no later than ten days
                        thereafter. In either case, the notice must be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The notice must supply a form to be used by the person asserting appraisal rights in order to complete the exercise of those rights. Under section 13.22(b)(2)(ii), the notice must specify the date by which the shareholder’s executed form must be received
                        by the corporation, which date must be at least 40 days but not more than 60 days after the appraisal notice is sent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 13.22(b)(2)(i), the notice must also specify where and when share certificates must be deposited; the time for deposit may not be set at a date earlier than the date for receiving the required form under section 13.22(b)(2)(ii).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 13.22(b)(1) and (2)(i) require the corporation to specify in the form supplied for demanding payment where the form must be sent as well as the date of the first announcement of the terms of the proposed corporate action. This is the critical
                        date for determining the rights of shareholder-transferees: persons who became shareholders prior to that date are entitled to full appraisal rights, while persons who became shareholders on or after that date are entitled only
                        to the more limited rights provided by section 13.25. See the Official Comments to sections 13.23 and 13.25. The date set forth in the form should be the date the principal terms of the transaction were announced by the corporation
                        to shareholders. This may be the day the terms were communicated directly to the shareholders, included in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, published in a newspaper of general circulation that can be
                        expected to reach the financial community, or any earlier date on which such terms were first announced by any other person or entity to such persons or sources. Any announcement to news media or to shareholders that relates to
                        the proposed transaction but does not contain the principal terms of the transaction to be authorized at the shareholders’ meeting is not considered to be an announcement for the purposes of section 13.22.
                    </p>

                        Sections 13.22(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) require the corporation to state its estimate of the fair value of the shares and how shareholders may obtain the number of shareholders and number of shares demanding appraisal rights. The information required
                        by sections 13.22(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) is intended to help shareholders assess whether they wish to demand payment or to withdraw their demand for appraisal, but the information under section 13.22(b)(2)(iv) is required to
                        be sent only to those shareholders from whom the corporation has received a written request. If such request is received, the corporation must respond within ten days after forms are due pursuant to section 13.22(b)(2)(ii). Finally,
                        section 13.22(b)(2)(v) requires the corporation to specify the date by which the shareholder’s notice to withdraw under section 13.23 must be received.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.23 permits shareholders to perfect their appraisal rights under subsection (a), subject to their right to withdraw under subsection (b). In the case of a transaction involving a vote by shareholders, returning the executed form and, in the
                        case of certificated shares, depositing the shares are the shareholder’s confirmation of the shareholder’s intention expressed earlier under section 13.21(a) to pursue appraisal rights; in the case of a merger of a subsidiary under
                        section 11.05, it is the shareholder’s first statement of this position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shareholder should include on the appraisal form a certification as to whether the date on which the beneficial shareholder acquired beneficial ownership of the shares was before (or on or after) the date the transaction was announced. See section
                        13.22(b)(1). This information permits the corporation to exercise its right under section 13.25 to defer payment of compensation for certain shares. The corporation may elect to proceed under section 13.25 with respect to those
                        shareholders who fail to make the required certification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.23(a) also requires persons with certificated shares who file the required form to deposit their share certificates as directed by the corporation in its appraisal notice. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder’s shares, that shareholder
                        loses all rights as a shareholder unless the shareholder withdraws from the appraisal process pursuant to section 13.23(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to certificated shares, this provision differs from many statutes in that the certificates are deposited for retention, rather than “submitted for notation.” This difference reflects the requirement in section 13.22(b)(2)(i) for deposit only
                        after the corporate action became effective; in contrast, many state statutes require shareholders to send in their certificates in anticipation of the effectuation of the proposed corporate action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, under section 13.23(b), a shareholder may withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the deadline set forth in the appraisal notice. After that date, however, a shareholder who has complied with the
                        requirements to execute and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the share certificates may not withdraw from the process without the corporation’s written consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 13.23(c), a shareholder who fails to execute and return the form with respect to the shares of a class or series for which the shareholder is demanding appraisal or does not deposit that shareholder’s share certificates as required by section
                        13.23(a) loses all rights to pursue appraisal and obtain payment under this chapter. If a beneficial shareholder wishes to assert appraisal rights in place of the record shareholder, the beneficial shareholder must also comply
                        with section 13.03(b).

                        plus interest. Section 13.24(b)(2) requires that estimate to at least equal the corporation’s estimate of fair value given pursuant to section 13.22(b)(2)(iii). Since under section 13.23(a) all rights as a shareholder are terminated
                        with the deposit of that shareholder’s shares, the former shareholder should have immediate use of such money. A difference of opinion over the total amount to be paid should not delay payment of the amount that is undisputed.
                        Thus, the corporation must pay its estimate of fair value, plus interest from the effective date of the corporate action, without waiting for the conclusion of the appraisal proceeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the former shareholder must decide whether or not to accept the payment in full satisfaction, the corporation must at this time furnish the former shareholder with the information specified in section 13.24(b), with a reminder of the former shareholder’s
                        further rights and liabilities.

                        This section differs from the Model Act by requiring the corporation to send its offer of payment, rather than payment itself, to the dissenter upon completion of the transaction or (if the transaction did not need shareholder approval and has been completed)
                        upon receipt of payment demand. Payment is made to the dissenter upon his acceptance of the corporation’s offer in writing. Payment is made to the nonaccepting dissenter at the commencement of the court proceeding under G.S. 55-13-30.

                    <p>
                        Section 13.25(a) gives the corporation the option to treat differently shares acquired on or after the date of public announcement of the proposed corporate action; this date is specified by the corporation in its appraisal notice under section 13.22(b)(1).
                        At the corporation’s option, holders of shares acquired on or after this date, or shareholders who fail to certify otherwise under section 13.23(a), are not entitled to immediate payment under section 13.24. Instead, shareholders
                        described in subsection (a) may receive only an offer of payment which is conditioned on their agreement to accept it in full satisfaction of their claim. If the right of unconditional immediate payment were granted as to all after-acquired
                        shares, speculators and others might be tempted to buy shares merely for the purpose of demanding appraisal. Since the function of appraisal rights is to protect investors against unforeseen changes, there is no need to give equally
                        favorable treatment to purchasers who knew or should have known about the proposed changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The date used as a cut-off for determining the application of this section is when “the principal terms” of the transaction are first announced to shareholders or to a newspaper of general circulation that can be expected to reach the financial community
                        or included in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cut-off should not be set at an earlier date, such as when the first public statement that the corporate action was under consideration was made, because
                        the goal of this section is to prevent use of appraisal rights as a speculative device after the terms of the transaction are announced. See the Official Comment to section 13.22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.25(b) requires the corporation to furnish specified information to all shareholders described in subsection (a) and offer them the option of accepting the corporation’s estimate of fair value plus interest, in full satisfaction of their claims,
                        provided that such shareholders so accept and notify the corporation within ten days of receiving this offer. Within ten days after receiving a shareholder’s acceptance, the corporation must pay that shareholder in cash the stated
                        fair value plus interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A shareholder may accept the offered payment in full satisfaction of that shareholder’s claim; alternatively, a shareholder may reject the corporation’s offer and demand a judicial determination under section 13.26 and payment of the amount so determined
                        at the termination of the proceeding. A shareholder who does not satisfy the requirements of section 13.26 shall be deemed to have accepted the corporation’s offer.

                        A shareholder who is not content with the corporation’s remittance under section 13.24, or offer of remittance under section 13.25, and wishes to pursue appraisal rights further must state in writing the amount the shareholder is willing to accept. A
                        shareholder whose demand is deemed arbitrary, unreasonable or not in good faith, however, runs the risk of being assessed litigation expenses under section 13.31. These provisions are designed to encourage settlement without a
                        judicial proceeding.

                        A shareholder to whom the corporation has made payment (or who has been offered payment under section 13.25) must make a supplemental demand within 30 days after receipt of the payment or offer of payment in order to permit the corporation to make an
                        early decision on initiating appraisal proceedings. A failure to make such demand causes the shareholder to relinquish under section 13.26(b) anything beyond the amount the corporation paid or offered to pay.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT

                    <p>
                        Section 13.30 retains the concept of judicial appraisal as the ultimate means of determining fair value. The proceeding is to be commenced by the corporation within 60 days after a timely demand for payment under section 13.26 was received. If the proceeding
                        is not commenced within this period, the corporation must pay the additional amounts demanded by the shareholders under section 13.26. See the Official Comment to section 13.26.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All demands for payment made under section 13.26 are to be resolved in a single proceeding brought in the county in the state where the corporation’s principal office is located or, if it is a foreign corporation, where its registered office is located,
                        or if it has no registered office, where the principal office of the corporation which issued the shares to be appraised was located. All shareholders making section 13.26 demands must be made parties, with service by publication
                        authorized if necessary. Appraisers may be appointed within the discretion of the court. Since the nature of the proceeding is similar to a proceeding in equity or for an accounting, section 13.30(d) provides that there is no right
                        to a jury trial. The final judgment establishes not only the fair value of the shares in the abstract but also determines how much each shareholder who made a section 13.26 demand should actually receive.

                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act in several respects. The North Carolina version provides for the court proceeding to be commenced by the dissenter rather than the corporation. At the commencement of the proceeding, the corporation must pay the
                        amount of its offer to the dissenter. A dissenter who does not commence a timely court proceeding may either accept the corporation’s offer or resume his status as a nondissenting shareholder. A dissenter who takes no action resumes
                        the status of a nondissenting shareholder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection 13.30(b) of the Model Act contains special venue provisions for proceedings under this section. That provision was omitted, and general venue rules apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section expressly provides in subsection (d) that dissenters in a public corporation are not entitled to a jury trial in the appraisal of the ‘fair value” of their shares.

                        Even if a particular transaction is one for which appraisal rights are available, the shareholder must satisfy certain requirements set forth in G.S. 55-13-21, G.S. 55-13-22, and G.S. 55-13-23 to be entitled to appraisal rights including (1) providing
                        a notice of intent to demand payment if the proposed transaction is effectuated, (2) not voting in favor of the proposed transaction, and (3) returning a form after the closing of the transaction to perfect appraisal rights, accompanied
                        by any stock certificates in respect of the shareholder’s certificated shares. Despite these statutory requirements for appraisal, the North Carolina Business Court in
                        <i>
        Reynolds Am. Inc. v. Third Motion Equities Master Fund Ltd.,
       </i> 2019 NCBC 35 (2019) found that it lacked jurisdiction under G.S. 55-13-30 to review each shareholder’s entitlement to appraisal before making a determination on fair value. Effective August 16, 2021, this section is
                        amended to confirm that a court in an appraisal proceeding commenced on or after the effective date, in addition to determining fair value of shares, has jurisdiction to first determine whether a shareholder complied with the requirements
                        set forth in the North Carolina Business Corporation Act so as to be entitled to appraisal rights.

                        This section was amended by both S.L. 1997-202, s. 4 (amending subsection (a) and repealing subsection (a1)), and S.L. 1997-485, ss. 5 and 5.1 (amending subsections (a), (c), and (d)). The effective date provisions of the two acts differed. S.L. 1997-202
                        applied to corporate actions to which shareholders could dissent occurring on or after October 1, 1997. S.L. 1997-485, s. 5, applied to proceedings commenced on or after October 1, 1997.

                        To fill a potential gap between the two acts, S.L. 1997-485, s. 5.1, amended subsection (a), as amended by s. 5 of that act, to read:

                        “(a) If a demand for payment under G.S. 55-13-28 remains unsettled, the dissenter may commence a proceeding within 60 days after the date of his payment demand under G.S. 55-13-28 by filing a complaint with the Superior Court Division of the General Court
                        of Justice to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. Within 10 days after service upon it of [the] complaint, the corporation shall pay to the dissenter the amount offered by the corporation under G.S. 55-13-25.”

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.31(a) provides a general rule that the costs of the appraisal proceeding should be assessed against the corporation. Nevertheless, the court is authorized to assess these costs, in whole or in part, against all or some of the shareholders demanding
                        appraisal if it concludes they acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith regarding the rights provided by this chapter. Similarly, under section 13.31(b), the court may assess fees and expenses of counsel and experts
                        against the corporation or against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal for the reasons stated in this subsection. Under section 13.31(c), if the corporation is not required to pay the counsel fees for the shareholders
                        demanding appraisal, the court may require all shareholders who benefitted from the services of counsel to share in the payment of such fees. The purpose of all these grants of discretion with respect to costs and counsel fees
                        is to increase the incentives of both sides to proceed in good faith under this chapter to attempt to resolve their disagreement without the need of a formal judicial appraisal of the value of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While subsections (a)-(c) allocate costs and expenses in an appraisal proceeding, subsection (d) covers the situation where the corporation was obligated to make payment and did not meet this obligation. In that event, the shareholder may sue the corporation
                        directly for the amount owed. In such an action, subsection (d) requires the court, to the extent the shareholder was successful, to impose all costs and expenses, including counsel fees, on the corporation.
                    </p>

                        Subsection (a) of this section differs from the Model Act by providing simply that “the court shall assess the costs as it finds equitable.” This language was adapted from former G.S. 55-113(e). The words “either or” were inserted before “any other” in
                        subdivision (b)(2) to clarify a possible ambiguity.

                    Section 14.01 provides a simple method of voluntary dissolution for a corporation that has not issued shares or commenced business. These provisions are alternative: a corporation may utilize section 14.01 if it has not issued shares (even though it has
                    commenced business) or if it has issued shares but has not commenced business. Dissolution may be accomplished in either of these situations simply by a majority vote of the incorporators or initial directors. (See section 2.05 and
                    its Official Comment for a discussion of the roles of “incorporators” or “initial directors” in the organization of a corporation.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simple method of dissolution is likely to be used by name-holding corporations or by corporations formed for the initiation of a new venture when the reasons for the initial creation of the corporation have been completely realized or will never
                    come to fruition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The form of articles of dissolution provided in section 14.01 takes account of the fact that a corporation may utilize this section even though it has received capital from the issuance of shares or has incurred liabilities either from the commencement
                    of business without issuing shares or from its organization; hence the articles must state that no debts remain unpaid, and that the net assets of the corporation remaining after winding up have been distributed to the shareholders.

                    This section modifies the Model Act in that dissolution by the directors or incorporators is authorized only in the case of a corporation that has not issued shares. In addition, the incorporators are authorized to act only if the corporation has no directors,
                    and the articles of dissolution must identify the officers and directors or, if none, the incorporators.

                    A corporation that has issued shares and commenced business may dissolve voluntarily only with the approval of its shareholders. Section 14.02 requires the board of directors to propose dissolution and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. The
                    board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the proposal to dissolve be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation.
                    If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, to the shareholders when presenting the proposal to dissolve to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissolution, to be approved, must receive the vote of a majority of the outstanding votes entitled by the articles of incorporation to vote on the proposal. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under section 7.25. Nonvoting classes
                    of shares are not given a statutory right to vote on proposals to dissolve (either as separate voting groups or together with voting shares) by the Revised Model Act on the theory that, upon dissolution, the rights of all classes or
                    series of shares are fixed by the articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation, however, may stipulate that specified classes or series of shares are entitled to vote by separate voting groups. Thus, in the absence of specific
                    provision in the articles of incorporation, only the shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally by the articles of incorporation are entitled to vote on dissolution. The articles of incorporation may also specify that a greater
                    percentage of votes is required to approve the proposal than is required by section 14.02.

                <p>
                    The board of directors may condition its submission of a proposal to the shareholders under subsection (c) on its receiving a specified percentage of the votes of shareholders of one or more classes or series, voting by separate voting groups, or on some
                    other basis. See the discussion of conditional submissions in the Official Comment to section 10.03.

                <p>
                    This section differs from former G.S. 55-118(a) in that only voting shares are entitled to vote on a proposal to dissolve and, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, or the resolution of the board
                    of directors approving the dissolution, only a majority of the voting shares is required to adopt the proposal. It should be noted that all shareholders, whether or not entitled to vote, are still entitled to notice of the shareholders’
                    meeting at which the dissolution proposal will be considered. Under prior law, the board of directors was required to recommend the dissolution; under this section, the board must recommend the dissolution proposal to the shareholders
                    unless it determines that, because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances, it should make no recommendation to the shareholders. In addition, the board of directors may now condition its submission of a dissolution
                    proposal “on any basis.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language of the Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in G.S. 55-10-03.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under former G.S. 55-117, a corporation could be dissolved by written consent of all of the shareholders, without action by the board of directors. This provision was not brought forward.

                    The act of filing the articles of dissolution makes the decision to dissolve a matter of public record and establishes the time when the corporation must begin the process of winding up and cease carrying on its business except to the extent necessary
                    for winding-up. The articles of dissolution must describe the manner in which the proposal to dissolve was submitted to the shareholders and describe the vote taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the Model Act, articles of dissolution may be filed at the commencement of winding-up or at any time thereafter. This is the only filing required for voluntary dissolution; no filing is required to mark the completion of winding-up since the existence
                    of the corporation continues for certain purposes even after the business is wound up and the assets remaining after satisfaction of all creditors are distributed to the shareholders. No time limit for filing the articles is specified,
                    and it often may be desirable to postpone filing until winding up is far along or even complete.

                    A corporation is dissolved on the date the articles of dissolution are effective. After this date the corporation is referred to as a “dissolved corporation,” although its existence continues under section 14.05 for purposes of winding up.

                    Articles of dissolution are the only required filing under this Act, and a corporation is dissolved on the effective date of its articles of dissolution. There is no filing comparable to the certificate of completed liquidation required under former G.S.

                    winding up the affairs of the corporation. Minor clarifying changes were also made in subsection (a).

                    Voluntary dissolution may be revoked within 120 days of the effective date of the dissolution. Because of the importance and finality of dissolution, the decision to revoke dissolution generally requires shareholder authorization (unless the dissolution
                    was approved solely by the initial directors or incorporators under section 14.01). Section 14.04(b), however, contemplates that the board of directors may revoke dissolution if it is granted that authority in advance by the shareholders
                    when approving the dissolution. Such authorization is often included in proposals to dissolve that are contingent upon the effectuation of another transaction, such as a sale of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain other action requiring shareholder approval may be revoked by the board of directors without express shareholder approval. (See sections 11.03 and 12.02). By contrast, dissolution under section 14.04 may not be revoked by the board of directors
                    without approval of the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Articles of revocation of dissolution must be filed to reflect the decision to resume the business of the corporation. The information required in these articles parallels the information required in the original articles of dissolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The effect of articles of revocation of dissolution is to eliminate the requirement that the corporation cease to conduct its business except as part of the winding-up process and permit it to resume its business without limitation and as if dissolution
                    had never occurred.

                    Under former G.S. 55-120(a), a corporation could revoke its dissolution at any time prior to the filing of the certificate of completed liquidation. Since the provision for filing a certificate of completed liquidation has not been brought forward, this
                    section provides that any revocation must occur within 120 days after the effective date of the dissolution.

                <p>
                    Subsection (e) changes former G.S. 55-120(b) by providing that the revocation relates back to the effective date of the dissolution as if the dissolution had never occurred. The Model Act was modified, however, to provide that the relation back rule is
                    subject to the rights of any person who reasonably relied to his prejudice upon the filing of the articles of dissolution.

                <p>
                    Section 14.05(a) provides that dissolution does not terminate the corporate existence but simply requires the corporation thereafter to devote itself to winding up its affairs and liquidating its assets; after dissolution, the corporation may not carry
                    on its business except as may be appropriate for winding-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act uses the term “dissolution” in the specialized sense described above and not to describe the final step in the liquidation of the corporate business. This is made clear by section 14.05(b), which provides that chapter 14 dissolution does
                    not have any of the characteristics of common law dissolution, which treated corporate dissolution as analogous to the death of a natural person and abated lawsuits, vested equitable title to corporate property in the shareholders,
                    imposed the fiduciary duty of trustees on directors who had custody of corporate assets, and revoked the authority of the registered agent. Section 14.05(b) expressly reverses all of these common law attributes of dissolution and makes
                    clear that the rights, powers, and duties of shareholders, the directors, and the registered agent are not affected by dissolution and that suits by or against the corporation are not affected in any way.

                    The consequences of filing articles of dissolution under this Act remain the same as under former G.S. 55-114(b). Subdivision (b)(2) expressly permits the dissolution proposal to provide for closing of the corporation’s share transfer records, a procedure
                    that was not specifically addressed under prior law.

                    Subsection (c) brings forward the provision of former G.S. 55-114(c), under which a dissolved corporation was not subject to franchise tax unless it engaged in business activities not appropriate to winding up and liquidating its business.

                        Company’s failure to file a certificate of completed liquidation or to send or publish notice of dissolution, did not trigger the two-year “survival” period nor did its corporate existence cease; thus, the company was an existing entity to which the current

                        By failing to account for the corporation’s liabilities and incorrectly calculating the total net worth of the companies, the trial court acted contrary to the statute and misapprehended the facts or misapplied the law, which were valid grounds for relief,
                        plus this could also be considered a valid ground for amendment, despite the lack of an objection raised at trial, because it concerned an error of law arising for the first time in the order; the granting of the motion to amend

                    Sections 14.06 and 14.07 provide a new and simplified system for handling known and unknown claims against a dissolved corporation, including claims based on events that occur after the dissolution of the corporation. Section 14.06 deals solely with known
                    claims while section 14.07 deals with unknown or subsequently arising claims. A claim is a “known” claim even if it is unliquidated (see section 14.06(d)); a claim that is contingent or has not matured so that there is no immediate
                    right to bring suit is not a “known” claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Known claims are handled in section 14.06 through a process of written notice to claimants; the written notice must contain the information described in section 14.06(b). Section 14.06(c) then provides fixed deadlines by which claims are barred under
                    various circumstances, as follows:

                    These principles, it should be emphasized, do not lengthen statutes of limitation applicable under general state law. Thus claims that are not barred under the foregoing rules — for example, if the corporation does not act on a claim — will nevertheless
                    be subject to the general statute of limitations applicable to claims of that type.

                    Even though the directors are not trustees of the assets of a dissolved corporation (see section 14.05(b)(3)), they must discharge or make provision for discharging all of the corporation’s known liabilities before distributing the remaining assets to
                    the shareholders. See sections 14.05(a)(3) and (4). See also sections 6.40 and 8.33.

                    Earlier versions of the Model Act did not recognize the serious problem created by possible claims that might arise long after the dissolution process was completed and the corporate assets distributed to shareholders. Most of these claims were based
                    on personal injuries occurring after dissolution but caused by allegedly defective products sold before dissolution, but they also involved negligence for which the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the negligence was
                    discovered (e.g., a surgical instrument left inside the patient). The application of the Model Act provision (and of the state dissolution statutes phrased in different terms) to this problem led to confusing and inconsistent results.
                    See generally Friedlander and Gilbert, “Post Dissolution Liabilities of Shareholders and Directors for Claims Against Dissolved Corporations,” 31 VAND. L. REV. 1363 (1978). The problems raised by this type of litigation are intractable:
                    on the one hand, the application of a mechanical two-year limitation period to a claim for injury that occurs after the period has expired involves obvious injustice to the plaintiff. On the other hand, to permit these suits generally
                    makes it impossible ever to complete the winding up of the corporation, make suitable provision for creditors, and distribute the balance of the corporate assets to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some circumstances a tort law concept of transferee liability, sometimes characterized as “de facto merger,” has been applied to allow plaintiffs incurring post dissolution injuries to bring suit against the person that acquired the corporate assets.
                    See the Official Comment to section 11.01. Some courts have refused to apply this doctrine, particularly when the purchaser of the corporate assets has not continued the business of the dissolved corporation. In these cases, the remedy
                    of the plaintiff is limited to claims against the dissolved corporation and its shareholders receiving assets pursuant to the dissolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution adopted in section 14.07 is to continue the liability of a dissolved corporation for subsequent claims for a period of five years after it publishes notice of dissolution. It is recognized that a five year cut-off is itself arbitrary, but
                    it is believed that the great bulk of post dissolution claims will arise during this period. This provision is therefore believed to be a reasonable compromise between the competing considerations of providing a remedy to injured plaintiffs
                    and providing a period of repose after which dissolved corporations may distribute remaining assets free of all claims and shareholders may receive them secure in the knowledge that they may not be reclaimed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Directors must generally discharge or make provision for discharging all of the corporation’s liabilities before distributing the remaining assets to the shareholders. See the Official Comment to section 14.06. But section 14.07 does not contemplate that
                    liquidating distributions to shareholders will be deferred until all possible claims are barred under section 14.07. Many claims covered by this section are of a type for which provision may be made by the purchase of insurance or
                    by the setting aside of a portion of the assets, thereby permitting prompt distributions in liquidation. Claimants, of course, may always have recourse to the remaining assets of the dissolved corporation. See section 14.07(d)(1).
                    Further, where unexpected claims arise after distributions have been made to shareholders in liquidation, section 14.07(d)(2) authorizes recovery against the shareholders receiving the earlier distributions. The recovery, however,
                    is limited to the smaller of the recipient shareholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the total amount of assets received as liquidating distributions by the shareholder from the corporation. The provision ensures that claimants
                    seeking to recover distributions from shareholders will try to recover from the entire class of shareholders rather than concentrating only on the larger shareholders and protects the limited liability of shareholders.

                <p>
                    This section contains the substance of subsection 14.07(d) of the Model Act and was added for the purpose of setting forth provisions applicable to claims covered by either G.S. 55-14-06 or G.S. 55-14-07. The language of the Model Act was modified in
                    subdivision (a)(1) to make clear that undistributed assets of a dissolved corporation include coverage under any applicable insurance policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under subdivision (a)(2), a claim may be enforced against a shareholder to the extent of the lesser of his pro rata share thereof or the corporate assets distributed to him in liquidation. In no event may a shareholder’s total liability under this section
                    exceed the total amount of assets distributed to him in liquidation. This subdivision, unlike former G.S. 55-54, makes a shareholder liable regardless of whether the distribution to him was made at a time when the corporation was unable
                    to meet its obligations and regardless of whether he knew that the distribution violated this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section does not bring forward the provision in former G.S. 55-32(1) allowing creditors to enforce certain specified statutory liabilities in direct actions against directors. However, substantially the same relief should be available to creditors
                    in insolvency proceedings and through attachment or similar procedures.

                        If the corporation does not avail itself of protection against claims, a claim may be enforced under subdivision (a)(2); this enforcement provision makes a shareholder liable regardless of whether the distribution was made at a time when the corporation

                    for judicial review in protection of rights that might otherwise be lost.” This position, however, was not generally accepted — in 1982 only three jurisdictions limited involuntary dissolution to judicial action — with all other jurisdictions
                    permitting administrative dissolution for a variety of reasons, usually including a failure to pay franchise taxes and often including failure to file annual reports or otherwise comply with similar requirements of the corporation
                    statutes. Some of these administrative dissolution statutes appear in the tax statutes rather than the corporation statutes of the states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience in most states has been that administrative dissolution, or the threat thereof, is an effective enforcement mechanism for a variety of statutory obligations. Judicial dissolution is inappropriate for many of these violations because of
                    its cost and the diversion of limited legal resources, particularly since most violations reflect the abandonment of the corporation by its owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advantages of administrative dissolution in these circumstances are compelling: it not only reduces the number of records maintained by the secretary of state, but also avoids further wasteful attempts to compel compliance by the abandoned corporations
                    and returns the corporate name promptly to the status of available names. Therefore, the revised Model Act includes, in sections 14.20 through 14.23, a model provision for the administrative dissolution of corporations in certain limited
                    circumstances. These circumstances are set forth in section 14.20 and closely parallel provisions found in most state statutes on this subject.

                    Administrative dissolution by the Secretary of State, which is new to the corporate law of North Carolina, provides the Secretary of State with a simple, inexpensive method of enforcing this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act provides in subdivision 14.20(1) for administrative dissolution by the Secretary of State upon nonpayment of any taxes or penalties imposed by law, including franchise taxes. This provision conflicts with the provisions of G.S. 105-230 through
                    105-232, which empower the Secretary of Revenue to cancel a corporate franchise for nonpayment of taxes. Accordingly the scope of subdivision (1) of this Act is restricted to failure to pay penalties, fees, or other payments due under
                    this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision (5) provides for administrative dissolution upon expiration of the period of duration stated in the corporation’s articles of incorporation. Under former G.S. 55-115, a corporation that continued to conduct business after the expiration of
                    its period of duration could at any time amend its charter to extend or perpetuate its period of existence. This provision was not brought forward.

                    Many failures to comply with statutory requirements that may give rise to administrative dissolution under section 14.20 occur because of oversight or inadvertence by responsible corporate officers of corporations that are continuing in business. Such
                    failures are usually corrected promptly when brought to the corporation’s attention. Sections 14.21(a) and (b) therefore provide a mandatory notice by the secretary of state to each corporation subject to administrative dissolution
                    and a 60-day grace period following the notice before the certificate of administrative dissolution may be filed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most instances, the issue whether the corporation is subject to administrative dissolution will not be controverted. If a corporation is administratively dissolved, it may petition the secretary of state for reinstatement under section 14.22 and, if
                    this is denied, it may appeal to the courts under section 14.23.

                    Section 14.22 provides a two-year period during which a corporation may seek reinstatement following administrative dissolution. This section may apply when a corporation through inadvertence or a failure to maintain a registered agent fails to receive
                    or respond to the predissolution notice of default required by section 14.21. A corporation that is reinstated pursuant to this section resumes carrying on its business as before dissolution.

                <p>
                    In order to be eligible for reinstatement, a corporation must comply with all statutory requirements at the time it seeks reinstatement. It must establish, for example, that all taxes have been paid and that its name is available when it files the application
                    for reinstatement.

                    Section 14.30 provides grounds for the judicial dissolution of corporations at the request of the state, a shareholder, a creditor, or a corporation which has commenced voluntary dissolution. This section states that a court “may” order dissolution if
                    a ground for dissolution exists. Thus there is discretion on the part of the court as to whether dissolution is appropriate even though grounds exist under the specific circumstances.

                <p>
                    Section 14.30(1) preserves longstanding and traditional provisions authorizing the state to seek to dissolve involuntarily a corporation by judicial decree. While this power has been exercised only rarely in recent years, this right of the state involves
                    a policing action that provides a means by which the state may ensure compliance with, and nonabuse of, the fundamentals of corporate existence. Section 14.30(1) limits the power of the state in this regard to grounds that are reasonably
                    related to this objective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legality of proposed corporations or of proposed actions has sometimes been tested by the secretary of state’s refusal to accept documents for filing. The role of the secretary of state in reviewing documents for filing has been restricted by the
                    Model Act (see section 1.25 and its Official Comment). It is intended that suits under this subchapter will replace those actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 14.31(2) provides for involuntary dissolution at the suit of a shareholder under circumstances involving deadlock or significant abuse of power by controlling shareholders or directors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissolution because of deadlock is available if there is a deadlock at the directors’ level but only if (1) the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and (2) either “irreparable injury” to the corporation is being threatened or suffered or the
                    business and affairs “can no longer be conducted to the advantage of ” the shareholders. This language closely follows the earlier versions of the Model Act except that the requirement of “irreparable injury” has been relaxed to some
                    extent. Dissolution because of deadlock at the directors’ level is not dependent on the lapse of time during which the deadlock continues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dissolution is also available because of deadlock at the shareholders’ level if the shareholders are unable to elect directors over a two-year period. This remedy is particularly important in small or family-held corporations in which share ownership
                    may be divided on a 50-50 basis or a super majority provision (including possibly a requirement of unanimity) may effectively prevent the election of any directors. Dissolution under section 14.30(2)(iii) is not dependent on irreparable
                    injury or misconduct by the directors then in office; if injury or misconduct is present, a deadlocked shareholder may proceed under another clause of section 14.30(2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A shareholder may sue for involuntary dissolution upon proof either that those in control of the corporation are acting illegally, oppressively, or fraudulently (section 14.30(2)(ii)) or that the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted (section
                    14.30(2)(iv)). The application of these grounds for dissolution to specific circumstances obviously involves judicial discretion in the application of a general standard to concrete circumstances. The court should be cautious in the
                    application of these grounds so as to limit them to genuine abuse rather than instances of acceptable tactics in a power struggle for control of a corporation.

                    3. Dissolution by creditors
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creditors may obtain involuntary dissolution only when the corporation is insolvent and only in the limited circumstances set forth in section 14.30(3). Typically, a proceeding under the federal Bankruptcy Act is an alternative in these situations.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation that has commenced voluntary dissolution may petition a court to supervise its dissolution. Such an action may be appropriate to permit the orderly liquidation of the corporate assets and to protect the corporation from a multitude of creditors’
                    suits or suits by dissatisfied shareholders.

                    Subdivision (1) brings forward the 20-day notice requirement of former G.S. 55-122 for proceedings by the Attorney General.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under former G.S. 55-125(a)(2), a deadlock resulting from special provisions or arrangements designed to create veto power among shareholders was not grounds for judicial dissolution. Under subdivision (2) of this section, deadlock is grounds for dissolution,
                    even if it results from special provisions or arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clause (ii) of subdivision (2), brought forward from former G.S. 55-125(a)(4), is substituted for the Model Act’s standard of “illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent” conduct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clause (v) of subdivision (2), brought forward from former G.S. 55-125(a)(3), is added to the Model Act’s provisions to make agreements to liquidate specifically enforceable.

                <p>
                    The Model Act requirement that a creditor must show that the corporation is insolvent in order to be entitled to judicial dissolution is omitted.

                        trial court, in deciding whether to grant relief, had to exercise its equitable discretion, and consider the actual benefit and injury to all of the shareholders resulting from dissolution or other possible relief. To hold otherwise

                        It was reasonable for the court to conclude that the complaining shareholder, who began working for corporation in 1955 and worked continuously until he was abruptly fired in 1978, had a reasonable expectation that his employment would continue. Since
                        the controlling officer-director misappropriated corporate opportunities, and since the majority of the stockholders aligned themselves with this officer-director, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering liquidation

                    Section 14.31 designates the attorney general as the officer to bring suits for involuntary dissolution by the state. The county or counties where these suits must be commenced should be specified; it typically is either the state capital or the county
                    in which the corporation’s principal office is located. See the Official Comment to section 1.26. Suits brought for judicial dissolution under other subdivisions of section 14.30 must be brought where the corporation’s principal office
                    is located or, if not located in this state, where its registered office is or was last located.

                    Section 14.32 preserves provisions from earlier versions of the Model Act authorizing the appointment of a receiver, and adds authority to appoint a custodian as an alternative, for a corporation in a judicial dissolution proceeding. In many states, general
                    statutes or rules of court regulate the appointment of receivers or custodians and define their duties. Section 14.32 is designed to supplement these general provisions and grant the court power to take the steps it considers necessary
                    to resolve the internal corporate problem or to effect liquidation of the corporation in an efficient manner.

                <p>
                    Because there is no established body of law in North Carolina on appointment of custodians in these circumstances, this section and G.S. 55-14-31 differ from the Model Act in omitting all references to custodians and custodianship. The provisions of subsection
                    (c) describing the powers that may be given to a receiver were rewritten to provide greater clarity.

                    A court decree ordering that a corporation be dissolved involuntarily has the same legal effect as articles of dissolution. Section 14.33 requires that the secretary of state receive and file a copy of the decree. Thereafter the corporation’s business
                    and affairs are to be wound up as provided in sections 14.05, 14.06, and 14.07.

                    Section 14.40 is a deposit provision, not an escheat provision. It does not provide for ultimate disposition of unclaimed funds. Rather, it permits a corporation that has dissolved to pay over for safekeeping to the state treasurer (or other appropriate
                    state official with statutory authority to receive such funds) funds belonging to a creditor, claimant, or shareholder who cannot be found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The handling and ultimate disposition of unclaimed funds by the state treasurer or other appropriate state official is to be determined by state law other than the Model Act.

                <p>
                    A state may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which a foreign corporation is permitted to transact business within the state, subject, of course, to the restrictions of the United States Constitution. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a></cite>                    requires that a foreign corporation seeking to transact business within the state must (1) obtain a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and (2) maintain a registered office and appoint a registered agent within the
                    state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.01(a) states the basic requirement that a foreign corporation must obtain a certificate of authority before it transacts business within the state. Section 15.05 describes the scope of the privilege obtained by a certificate of authority while
                    section 15.02 describes the consequences of transacting business in the state without first obtaining the certificate of authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Model Act does not attempt to formulate an inclusive definition of what constitutes the transaction of business. Rather, the concept is defined in a negative fashion by section 15.01(b), which states that certain activities do
                    <i>
       not
      </i> constitute the transaction of business. In general terms, any conduct more regular, systematic, or extensive than that described in section 15.01(b) constitutes the transaction of business and requires the corporation to
                    obtain a certificate of authority. Typical conduct requiring a certificate of authority includes maintaining an office to conduct local intrastate business, selling personal property not in interstate commerce, entering into contracts
                    relating to the local business or sales, and owning or using real estate for general corporate purposes. But the passive owning of real estate for investment purposes does not constitute transacting business. See section 15.01(b)(9).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The test of “transacting business” defined in a negative way in section 15.01(b) applies only to the question whether the corporation’s contacts with the state are such that it must obtain a certificate of authority. It is not applicable to other questions
                    such as whether the corporation is amenable to service of process under state “long-arm” statutes or liable for state or local taxes. A corporation that has obtained (or is required to obtain) a certificate of authority to transact
                    business under chapter 15 will generally be subject to suit and state taxation in the state, while a corporation that is subject to service of process or state taxation in a state will not necessarily be required to obtain a certificate
                    of authority under chapter 15.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of activities set forth in section 15.01(b) is not exhaustive. See section 15.01(c). The list excludes several different types of activities from the definition of “transacting business,” which are discussed below.

                <p>
                    Section 15.01(b)(1) excludes “maintaining, defending or settling any proceeding.” The word “proceeding” is defined in section 1.40 to include all civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative suits or actions. Thus, a corporation is not “transacting
                    business” solely because it resorts to the courts of the state to recover an indebtedness, enforce an obligation, recover possession of personal property, obtain the appointment of a receiver, intervene in a pending proceeding, bring
                    a petition to compel arbitration, file an appeal bond, or pursue appellate remedies. Similarly, a foreign corporation is not required to obtain a certificate of authority merely because it files a complaint with the state securities
                    commission or other governmental agency or participates in an administrative proceeding within the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation does not “transact business” within a state under section 15.01 merely because some of its internal affairs occur within a state. Thus, a corporation may hold meetings of its board of directors or shareholders within a state without first
                    obtaining a certificate of authority (section 15.01(b)(2)). It also may maintain offices or agencies within a state relating solely to the transfer, registration, or exchange of its shares without obtaining a certificate of authority
                    (section 15.01(b)(4)). Other activities relating to the internal affairs of the corporation that do not constitute the transaction of business under section 15.01(b) include having officers or representatives of a corporation who reside
                    within or are physically present in the state; while there, the officers or representatives may make executive decisions relating to the affairs of the corporation without imposing on the corporation the requirement that it obtain
                    a certificate of authority in the state, provided these activities are not so regular and systematic as to cause the residence to be viewed as a business office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A foreign corporation may maintain a bank account with a bank within the state, make deposits and write checks on the account without obtaining a certificate of authority (section 15.01(b)(3)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A corporation is not “transacting business” within the meaning of section 15.01(a) if it is transacting business in interstate commerce (section 15.01(b)(10)) or soliciting or obtaining orders that must be accepted outside the state before they become
                    contracts (section 15.01(b)(6)). These limitations reflect the provisions of the United States Constitution that grant to the United States Congress exclusive power over interstate commerce, and preclude states from imposing restrictions
                    or conditions upon this commerce. These sections should be construed in a manner consistent with judicial decisions under the United States Constitution. Under these decisions, a foreign corporation is not required to obtain a certificate
                    of authority even though it sells goods within the state if they are shipped to the purchasers in interstate commerce. A corporation need not obtain a certificate of authority even if it also does work and performs acts within the
                    state incidental to the interstate business, e.g., if it takes or enforces a security interest incidental to these transactions. Nor is it required to obtain a certificate of authority merely because it sends traveling salesmen or
                    solicitors into a state so long as contracts are not made within the state. Similarly, an office may be maintained by a corporation in a state without obtaining a certificate of authority if the office’s functions relate solely to
                    interstate commerce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purchases of goods may of course be in interstate commerce as readily as sales. Thus, the purchase of personal property by a foreign corporation for shipment in interstate commerce out of the state does not require the corporation to obtain a certificate
                    of authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A foreign corporation does not need to obtain a certificate of authority if it sells goods in the state through independent contractors (section 15.01(b)(5)). These transactions are viewed as transactions by the independent contractors, not by the corporation
                    itself, even though the corporation sets some limits or ground rules for its contractors. If these controls are sufficiently pervasive, however, the corporation may be deemed to be selling for itself in intrastate commerce, and not
                    through the independent contractors, and therefore engaged in the transaction of business in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mere act of making a loan by a foreign corporation that is not in the business of making loans does not constitute transacting business in the state in which the loan is made. On the same theory a foreign corporation may obtain security for the repayment
                    of a loan, and foreclose or enforce the lien or security interest to collect the loan, without being deemed to be transacting business. See section 15.01(b)(7) and (8). Similarly, a refunding or “roll over” of a loan or its adjustment
                    or compromise does not involve the transaction of business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of “transacting business” involves regular, repeated, and continuing business contacts of a local nature. A single agreement or isolated transaction within a state does not constitute the transaction of business if there is no intention to
                    repeat the transaction or engage in similar transactions. Since the question is entirely one of fact, section 15.01(b)(10) retains the partially objective test from earlier versions of the Model Act that a transaction completed within
                    30 days does not constitute “transacting business” if it is not one in the course of “repeated transactions of a like nature.” A continuing transaction that is not completed within 30 days will likely require obtaining a certificate
                    of authority, whether or not it is one of a number of repeated transactions, but that issue is not addressed by the Model Act. The 30-day provision is, in other words, a “safe harbor” for not requiring a certificate of authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.01(c) makes clear that the list of transactions in section 15.01(b) is not exhaustive. Among the large number of other transactions which do not give rise to the requirement that a certificate of authority be obtained are the ownership of all
                    the shares of stock in a corporation that is engaged in local business within the state or as a limited partner in a limited partnership engaged in local business, or taking ministerial actions such as filing financing statements or
                    registering trademarks.

                    The Model Act was modified in subsection (a) by adding the words “under this Chapter or under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> of the General Statutes.”

                    The activities listed in the Model Act as not constituting the transaction of business appear to be narrower in certain respects than the activities listed in former G.S. 55-131(b). Subsection (b), which applies solely for purposes of this Act and not
                    for purposes of determining whether there is
                    <i>

                    Act’s text in subsection 15.01(c) unnecessary, and it was omitted.
                </p>

                            Transacting business within the State is defined as the transaction within the State of some substantial part of a party’s ordinary business, which must be continuous in the sense that it is distinguished from merely casual or occasional transactions,

                            The phrase “doing business in this State” is not susceptible of an all embracing definition, and each case must be decided upon the particular facts therein appearing, the general criteria being that a foreign corporation is doing business in this State
                            if it transacts in this State the business it was created and authorized to do, through representatives in this State, and thus is present in this State through the person of its representatives. Parris v. H.G. Fischer &amp;

                <p>
                    The purpose of section 15.02 is to induce corporations that are required to obtain a certificate of authority but have not to qualify promptly, without imposing harsh or erratic sanctions. The Model Act rejects the provisions adopted in a few states that
                    make unenforceable intrastate transactions by unqualified corporations or that impose punitive sanctions or forfeitures on nonqualifying corporations. Often the failure to qualify is a result of inadvertance or bona fide disagreement
                    as to the scope of the provisions of section 15.01, which are necessarily imprecise; the imposition of harsh sanctions in these situations is inappropriate. Further, as a matter of state policy it is generally preferable to encourage
                    qualification in case of doubt rather than to impose severe sanctions that may cause corporations to resist obtaining a certificate of authority in doubtful situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.02 closes the courts of the state to suits maintained by corporations which should have but which have not obtained a certificate of authority. However, this sanction is not a punitive one: section 15.02(e) states that the failure of the corporation
                    to qualify does not affect the validity of corporate acts, including contracts. Thus, a contract made by a nonqualified corporation may be enforced by the corporation simply by obtaining a certificate. Further, section 15.02(c) authorizes
                    a court to stay a proceeding to determine whether a corporation should have qualified to transact business and, if it concludes that qualification is necessary, it may grant a further stay to permit the corporation to do so. Thus,
                    the corporation will not be compelled to refile a suit if the corporation qualifies to transact business within a reasonable period. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage corporations to obtain certificates of authority and
                    to eliminate the temptation to raise section 15.02 defenses only after applicable statutes of limitation have run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.02(e) does not prevent a foreign corporation that has failed to obtain a certificate of authority from “defending any proceeding.” The distinction between “maintaining” a proceeding under section 15.02(a) and “defending any proceeding” under
                    section 15.02(e) is determined on the basis of whether affirmative relief is sought. A nonqualified corporation may interpose any defense or permissive or mandatory counterclaim to defeat a claimed recovery, but may not obtain an affirmative
                    judgment or decree based on the counterclaim unless it has obtained a certificate of authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to closing the courts of the state to a nonqualified foreign corporation, many states impose a penalty equal to all fees and franchise taxes that the foreign corporation would have been liable for if it had qualified to transact business when
                    it was first required to do so. This penalty is usually defined to equal the sum of fees and franchise taxes for each year or part thereof the corporation transacted business in the state without a certificate of authority. Similar
                    provisions appeared in earlier versions of the Model Act, but were modified in the present revision in favor of a specific dollar amount (which each state adopting the revised Model Act should insert in section 15.02(d) for each day
                    and year the foreign corporation fails to qualify. The revised Model Act does not treat liability for taxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.02(b) prevents evasion of section 15.02(a) by an assignment of a claim on which the foreign corporation is barred from bringing suit under section 15.02(a). If the successor has acquired all or substantially all of the assets of the foreign
                    corporation, the successor may maintain suit after it has qualified. In the case of all other assignments, the foreign corporation itself must obtain a certificate of authority before the assignee may maintain suit on the claim. The
                    phrase “all or substantially all” has the meaning set forth in the Official Comment to section 12.01.

                        Foreign corporation could enforce a foreign judgment obtained in a South Carolina court against the individuals where the corporation obtained its certificate of authority before the hearing in North Carolina; it was not necessary to obtain the certificate
                        of authority prior to commencing trial in South Carolina. Kyle &amp; Assocs. v. Mahan, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 587 S.E.2d 914, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2057

                        Trial court did not err in denying the general contractor’s motion to dismiss based on its argument that the judgment creditor had failed to obtain a certificate of authority to do business in North Carolina; the judgment creditor was not required to
                        have obtained a certificate of authority to maintain its lawsuit to collect money it believed it was owed. Quantum Corp. Funding, Ltd. v. B.H. Bryan Bldg.

                        Trial court erred in concluding that a foreign corporation transacted business in North Carolina and was required to obtain a certificate of authority under G.S. 55-15-01 and G.S. 55-15-02 to bring a lawsuit because the corporation’s interactions with
                        North Carolina consultants and an attorney concerned interstate commerce or the corporation’s internal affairs. Thus, the corporation was not transacting business in North Carolina. Harbin Yinhai Tech. v. Greentree Fin. Group,

                <p>
                    Section 15.03 provides that a foreign corporation seeking a certificate of authority to transact business in the state must file an application that contains the information set forth in this section. These disclosure requirements are supplemented by
                    the requirements of other sections in this chapter—15.04, 15.06, and 15.07—which require amended or supplemental filings in certain circumstances, and by section 16.22, which requires every qualified foreign corporation to file annual
                    reports containing specified information. Generally, the revised Model Act eliminates repetitious filings, so that information need be submitted to the secretary of state in only one document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purposes of these disclosure requirements are: (1) to ensure that citizens of the state have adequate information about foreign corporations in their transactions with them; (2) to put them in a status of equality with domestic corporations with respect
                    to information required to be furnished; (3) to facilitate their subjection to the jurisdiction of the state’s courts, thereby removing any disadvantage citizens of the state may have when dealing with them; and (4) to provide readily
                    accessible evidence of their existence. Other statutes relating to franchise taxes and regulatory matters may require a qualified foreign corporation to provide additional information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The information required to be included in the application for a certificate of authority by section 15.03 is the minimum needed to administer the filing requirements of the Model Act. The application must also be accompanied by a certificate of existence
                    and the filing fee required by section 1.22. A corporation that qualifies to transact business in a state must comply with the requirements of other statutes, including franchise tax and similar statutes. See section 15.05.

                <p>
                    This Act does not bring forward the requirement of former G.S. 55-138(a) that a foreign corporation include in its application the purposes it desires to pursue in this State and information with respect to its capital structure. In addition, the application
                    under this Act is submitted with a certificate of existence or good standing rather than the certified charter documents required under former G.S. 55-138.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (a) was modified to conform to changes from the Model Act in the address requirement made in G.S. 55-2-02 and G.S. 55-5-02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (c) brings forward former G.S. 55-139(b) because the Model Act contains no express requirement that the Secretary of State issue a certificate of authority.

                    Section 15.04 requires a foreign corporation to obtain an amended certificate of authority if it changes its corporate name, its duration, or the state or country of its incorporation. An amendment is not necessary to reflect changes in its principal
                    office address or in its current officers or directors since that information is supplied in the annual report. In addition, section 15.07 requires an immediate filing if the foreign corporation changes its registered office or registered
                    agent within the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other fundamental changes by a foreign corporation do not require amendments to the certificate of authority. The secretary of state will be advised of most of these changes through the annual report. See section 16.22. Thus, a person seeking to obtain
                    current information about a foreign corporation should examine the annual reports of the corporation as well as the application for certificate of authority and amendments to it. This procedure of requiring most changes to be reported
                    in the annual reports rather than as amendments to the certificate of authority should eliminate many unnecessary filings with the secretary of state without reducing the information available through the secretary of state’s office.

                    A certificate of authority authorizes a foreign corporation to transact business in the state subject to the right of the state to revoke the certificate. The privileges of this status are defined in section 15.05(b): a qualified foreign corporation has
                    the same (but no greater) privileges as a domestic corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.05(b), by granting to qualified foreign corporations all of the rights and privileges enjoyed by a domestic corporation, avoids discrimination that might otherwise be subject to constitutional challenge. On the other hand, section 15.05(b)
                    also contains a restriction or limitation: a qualified foreign corporation is subject to the same restrictions as a domestic corporation, including the same duties, penalties, and liabilities. This latter aspect of section 15.05(b)
                    has declined in importance as states have eliminated unnecessary or outdated restrictions on domestic corporations and, as a consequence of section 15.05(b), on qualified foreign corporations as well. In particular, section 15.05(b)
                    makes section 3.01 (corporate purposes) applicable to a qualified foreign corporation, and grants substantially the same powers to it as are possessed by a domestic corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.05(c) preserves the judicially developed doctrine that internal corporate affairs are governed by the state of incorporation even when the corporation’s business and assets are located primarily in other states.

                    A foreign corporation that obtains a certificate of authority in a state thereby agrees that it is amenable to suit in the state. Section 15.07 requires every such corporation continuously to maintain a registered office and registered agent within the
                    state upon whom service of process may be made. As is the case with a domestic corporation, the registered office may, but need not be, a business office of the foreign corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 15.07 is patterned after section 5.01, relating to the registered office and registered agent of a domestic corporation. For a fuller description of the policies underlying section 15.07, see the Official Comment to section 5.01.

                <p>
                    A foreign corporation that ceases to transact business within a state may withdraw from the state only by obtaining a certificate of withdrawal. A foreign corporation that ceases to transact business in the state but fails to obtain a certificate of withdrawal
                    will continue to be (1) subject to service of process on its registered agent or on its secretary pursuant to section 15.10 and (2) liable for franchise and other taxes under other statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The certificate of withdrawal provided by this section is recognition by the state that the foreign corporation has ceased to transact business in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application for certificate of withdrawal must appoint the secretary of state as the withdrawing corporation’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time it was authorized to transact business
                    in the state. The application must also set forth a mailing address to which the secretary of state may forward any process received, and the corporation must agree to notify the secretary of state of any change in that address. There
                    is no time limit on the obligation to advise the secretary of state of changes of mailing address. To ensure that the appointment of the secretary of state is unqualified and meets the precise requirements of this section, the secretary
                    of state may require that an application for certificate of withdrawal be on a form prescribed by him. See section 1.21.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Service of process on the secretary of state pursuant to the statements in the application for certificate of withdrawal effects service on the corporation under section 15.20(c). The secretary of state must then mail the process to the corporation at
                    the mailing address specified in the application or in a subsequent communication to the secretary of state advising him of a change in mailing address.

                    This section modifies the Model Act in subdivision (b)(3) to clarify and limit the circumstances under which service of process on the Secretary of State is effective with respect to a foreign corporation that has withdrawn from this State. In addition,
                    former G.S. 55-150(d), modified to conform to G.S. 55-15-03(c), was added as subsection (b1), because the Model Act contains no express requirement that the Secretary of State issue a certificate of withdrawal or send the certificate
                    to the foreign corporation or its representative.

                    Section 15.30 authorizes the administrative revocation of the certificate of authority of a foreign corporation on the grounds specified. Administrative revocation is effective only upon compliance with the procedure specified in section 15.31. A foreign
                    corporation that believes the administrative revocation is unwarranted may obtain judicial review of the secretary of state’s determination pursuant to section 15.32.

                <p>
                    If a qualified foreign corporation has dissolved or merged into another corporation, the secretary of state may proceed to revoke its certificate of authority to transact business solely on the basis of a certificate from the secretary of state or other
                    official of the state of incorporation. Section 15.30(6). This subdivision provides a simple and inexpensive method to eliminate the names of corporations that are no longer in existence from the records of the secretary of state,
                    thereby making available the corporate names for use by other entities.

                <p>
                    The procedure for revocation of a certificate of authority in section 15.31 establishes a simple method of completing the revocation while at the same time ensuring that the foreign corporation is advised of the contemplated action and has an opportunity
                    to contest it in appropriate situations. In most situations, revocation by the secretary of state will not be contested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After revocation, the secretary of state is appointed the foreign corporation’s agent for service of process; upon receipt of service, the secretary of state must forward the process to the foreign corporation’s principal address, as last reflected in
                    his records. Revocation, however, does not of itself terminate the authority of the foreign corporation’s registered agent, so that process served on that agent by a third person who was unaware of the revocation may be effective.

                    A corporation whose certificate of authority is revoked may obtain judicial review of the revocation decision. In the review proceeding the court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the corporation or take other action it deems appropriate.

                    The court with jurisdiction over an appeal should be specified; it is typically either a court in the state capital or a court in the county in which the corporation’s principal office is located. Moreover, states adopting this section of the Model Act
                    should specify who has the burden of proof on appeal and the standard for judicial review. See the Official Comment to section 1.26.

                <p>
                    Section 16.01(a) requires certain basic records to be maintained by the corporation. The Act does not generally specify how records must be maintained (other than in a manner so that they may be made available for inspection within a reasonable time),
                    where they must be located or, with the exception of section 16.02(a), where they must be available. They may be maintained in one or more offices within or without the state and in some cases, such as shareholder records, may be maintained
                    by agents of the corporation; indeed, in the case of records in intangible form, it may be impossible to determine where they are located.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.01(a) does not address the amount of detail that should appear in minutes or written actions. Minutes of meetings customarily include the formalities of notice, the time and place of the meeting, those in attendance, and the results of any
                    votes. Minutes of meetings and written actions without a meeting show formal action taken. The extent to which further detail is included is a matter of judgment which may depend upon the circumstances. Section 7.04, which addresses
                    written actions taken by shareholders, requires that written consents by shareholders be delivered to the corporation for filing with corporate records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Act does not provide normative standards for the financial statements and accounting records to be prepared or maintained. The financial statements to be maintained under section 16.01(b) are those that the corporation prepares in the operation of
                    its business, including in response to third party requirements. The form of the financial statements prepared by a corporation depends to some extent on the nature and complexity of the corporation’s business and third party requirements
                    such as those governing the preparation and filing of tax returns with applicable tax authorities. To accommodate the needs of the many different types of business corporations that may be subject to these provisions, including closely
                    held corporations, the Act does not require that the corporation prepare and maintain financial statements on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) if it is not otherwise required to prepare GAAP financial
                    statements. The Act does not define what accounting records must be maintained or mandate how long they must be maintained. The accounting records to be maintained under section 16.01(c) depend upon the form of the corporation’s financial
                    statements. For example, annual tax returns filed with the relevant taxing authorities may be the only annual financial statements prepared by small businesses operating on a cash basis and, in those instances, the requisite accounting
                    records to be maintained might consist of only a check register, vouchers and receipts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.01(d) requires the corporation to maintain such records of its shareholders as will permit it to compile a list of current shareholders when required. These records may vary from stubs from which certificates have been detached in the case
                    of corporations with a few shareholders to elaborate electronic data in the case of large corporations whose shares are publicly traded. The record may be maintained by the corporation or an agent, who traditionally is the transfer
                    agent but may be another agent. A corporation may maintain additional information regarding its shareholders, such as a list of nominees and nonobjecting beneficial owners if its shares are publicly traded.

       Revised North Carolina Commentary (2021)
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2016, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.016.html" target="_blank">Chapter 16</a></cite> of the Model Act was significantly revised to, among other things, modernize (i) the obligations of corporations to make financial
                    statements available to shareholders, (ii) the maintenance of corporate records, and (iii) shareholder inspection rights. Effective October 1, 2021, G.S. 55-16-01 was revised consistent with the Model Act to provide increased flexibility
                    to corporations and allow for recordkeeping approaches that are in common use (e.g., using technology and electronic storage rather than paper-based practices), while preserving a corporation’s obligation to retain key organizational,
                    governance, financial and accounting records that may be available for shareholder inspection under the North Carolina Business Corporation Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important change is that the corporation will no longer be required to maintain particular records at its principal office. This change reflects the reality that corporations may effectively maintain records in offices either within or outside North
                    Carolina, with agents, or in an electronic format (e.g., a cloud-based solution) in which a physical “location” cannot be determined or described. As amended, G.S. 55-16-01 no longer requires that the relevant records be maintained
                    “in written form or in another form capable of conversion into written form within a reasonable time” but instead simply requires that they be maintained “in a manner that may be made available for inspection within a reasonable time,”
                    which allows records to be maintained in a variety of non-paper formats (including electronically), but ensures that a qualified shareholder entitled to inspect records will have access within a reasonable time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As holders of a financial interest in a corporation, shareholders generally have the right to review certain records and information maintained by the corporation. These rights are commonly referred to as “inspection rights.” In North Carolina and many
                    other states, as well as in the Model Act, shareholder inspection rights fall into two distinct categories: (1) absolute rights to inspect certain fundamental corporate documents and (2) qualified rights to inspect other documents
                    for a proper purpose. With one exception and in contrast to the Model Act, the North Carolina Business Corporation Act prior to the 2021 amendments granted both absolute and qualified inspection rights only to “qualified shareholders”
                    who have been shareholders of the corporation for at least six months or hold at least five percent of the outstanding shares. This concept was carried forward in the 2021 amendments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Records subject to absolute rights - such as the corporation’s articles of incorporation, written communications from the corporation to shareholders and minutes of shareholders’ meetings - while not all publicly available, are not likely to contain sensitive
                    information. In contrast, records subject to qualified inspection rights, which include the corporation’s financial statements, accounting records and records of final action taken by the board of directors or a board committee, are
                    much more likely to contain competitively sensitive and potentially proprietary information. Accordingly, while a qualified shareholder may have a genuine interest in reviewing this information, the corporation likewise has a legitimate
                    business interest in protecting its confidentiality and restricting its use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recognition of the corporation’s interest, the changes in G.S. 55-16-02(c1) and G.S. 55-16-20(d)(1), respectively, allow corporations to impose reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use and distribution of records that are subject to qualified
                    inspection rights or of financial statements being delivered to a shareholder. Similarly, in the event of a court-ordered inspection of records under G.S. 55-16-04 or delivery of financial statements under G.S. 55-16-20(e), the changes
                    to G.S. 55-16-04(c) and G.S. 55-16-20(e)(2), respectively, allow the court to impose reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use and distribution of records or of the financial statements by the shareholder. Likewise, G.S.
                    55-16-04(c) and G.S. 55-16-20(e)(5), respectively, now create an exception to the requirement that the corporation pay the shareholder’s legal expenses of obtaining a court order if the corporation establishes that it refused inspection
                    or to deliver financial statements in good faith because the shareholder was unwilling to agree to reasonable restrictions on confidentiality, use or distribution proposed by the corporation.

                        It is not logical to conclude that the legislature intended to require a corporation to keep two sets of books, one for its stockholders, and the other for the government, if it wished to compute its taxes on a cash receipt basis. Watson v. Watson Seed

                        Former G.S. 55-37.1 was designed to give broad legislative approval to the use in evidence of corporate computer records. However, in declaring such computer records admissible in evidence, it did not deal with the special problems of reliability created

                    The inspection rights created by G.S. 55-16-02 are limited to “qualified” shareholders as defined in subdivision (3) of this section, a limitation not found in the Model Act. The concept of “qualified shareholder” was brought forward in 1989 in G.S. 55-16-02,
                    with slight modifications, from former G.S. 55-38(a). In contrast to the Model Act, subdivision (4) of this section provides that a beneficial owner who wishes to exercise inspection rights under Article 16 must have their ownership
                    certified to the corporation by the record holder in order to be a “shareholder” for purposes of the inspection rights set forth in G.S. 55-16-02.

                <p>
                    Under section 16.02(a), each shareholder is entitled to inspect all documents that deal with the shareholder’s interest in the corporation. The right to inspection includes the right to make copies, as further described in section 16.03. Although some
                    of these documents may also be a matter of public record in the office of the secretary of state, a shareholder should not be compelled to go to a public office that may be physically distant to examine the basic documents relating
                    to the corporation. The “principal office” of the corporation is defined in section 1.40 to be the location of the executive offices of the corporation at its address as set forth by the corporation in its annual report required by
                    section 16.21.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to the right to inspect minutes of meetings of, and written actions taken without a meeting by, shareholders, a shareholder is entitled to inspect only excerpts of meetings of, and records of written actions taken by, the board of directors
                    and board committees related to the purpose of the inspection. A shareholder is entitled to inspect the record of shareholders under section 16.02(b) without regard to the size or value of the shareholder’s holding. This right is independent
                    of the right to inspect a shareholders’ list under section 7.20.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.02(c) permits inspection of the financial statements and records described in section 16.02(b) by a shareholder only if the demand is made in good faith and for a “proper purpose.” Although not defined in the Act, “proper purpose” under section
                    16.02(c) has been defined in case law to involve a purpose that is reasonably relevant to the demanding shareholder’s interest as a shareholder. Section 16.02(c) requires that a shareholder designate “with reasonable particularity”
                    the purpose for the demand and the records he or she desires to inspect. Also, the records demanded must be “directly connected” with that purpose. If disputed by the corporation, the “connection” of the records to the shareholder’s
                    purpose may be determined by a court’s examination of the records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use or distribution of financial statements and records permitted by section 16.02(d) allow for the protection of confidential or proprietary information in the corporation’s records or sensitive matters
                    that might be disclosed in a shareholder inspection. Such restrictions might include, for example, requiring the demanding shareholder to sign a confidentiality and use agreement. A similar provision is found in section 16.04(d) in
                    connection with court ordered inspections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.02(e) provides shareholders of a corporation the right to receive from the corporation the notice and other information provided by the corporation to shareholders in connection with a meeting if the record date for voting is subsequent to
                    the record date for notice and the shareholder became entitled to vote after the record date for notice. This provision does not apply to information provided to shareholders by persons other than the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prohibition in section 16.02(f) does not apply to a shareholder agreement permissible under section 7.32. No inference should be drawn from the prohibition in section 16.02(f) as to whether other, unrelated sections of the Act may be modified by provisions
                    in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Section 16.02(g) preserves whatever independent rights of inspection exist under the referenced sources and does not create any rights, either expressly or by implication. A shareholder also
                    has the right to obtain financial statements under section 16.20.

                <p>
                    Section 16.03(a) provides that the rights of inspection and copying granted to shareholders in section 16.02 may be exercised by agents and attorneys of shareholders appointed by shareholders to conduct such inspection and copying. Providing the corporation
                    with the right to choose among alternative delivery methods for copies in section 16.03(b), including by electronic transmissions, is intended to reduce burdens on the corporation. No consent by the shareholder is required under section
                    1.41 for the corporation to furnish copies to the shareholder under section 16.03 by electronic transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.03(c) gives the corporation, at its option and expense, the right to provide a list of its shareholders instead of granting the right of inspection. Such a list must be compiled no earlier than the date of the written demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.03(d) permits the corporation to be reimbursed for the expense of providing copies of documents to a shareholder.

                <p>
                    Section 16.04 provides a judicial remedy if a corporation refuses to grant the right of inspection provided by section 16.02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the right of inspection under section 16.02(a) is invoked and the corporation refuses to grant inspection, the shareholder may seek a summary order compelling inspection at the corporation’s expense. A summary order is appropriate since the right of
                    inspection under section 16.02(a) is either automatic or subject only to a determination that the person is in fact a shareholder of the corporation. By contrast, if inspection is demanded under section 16.02(b), a number of matters
                    may be at issue, including the shareholder’s good faith and proper purpose for demands under section 16.02(c) or the reasonableness of the restrictions required by the corporation on the confidentiality, use or distribution of the
                    records. Accordingly, section 16.04(b) directs the court to handle the proceeding “on an expedited basis” instead of in a summary proceeding. The purpose of this phrase is to discourage dilatory tactics to avoid or delay inspection
                    without requiring the court to resolve these issues on a summary basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principal sanction against unreasonable delay or refusal to grant inspection is provided by section 16.04(c), which imposes on the corporation the shareholder’s expenses to obtain the order unless the corporation establishes that it refused inspection
                    in good faith on the grounds specified in section 16.04(c)(1) or (2). For example, a corporation may point to conduct of the shareholder involving improper use of information obtained from the corporation in the past as indicating
                    that reasonable doubt existed as to the shareholder’s present purpose or by showing that the corporation refused inspection because the shareholder had been unwilling to agree to reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use
                    or distribution of records demanded under section 16.02(b).

                        Generally, a lack of accountability to other shareholders would not, by itself, be sufficient grounds to pierce the corporate veil, as former G.S. 55-37 and former G.S. 55-38 provided an adequate remedy at law to enforce accountability. Dorton v. Dorton,

                        Trial court properly denied a member’s request for attorney’s fees in relation to an action seeking to inspect the business records of a club, as there was no statutory grounds for fees under G.S. 55-16-04, a fee provision of the parties consent order
                        could not authorize fees in the absence of statutory authority, and the trial court was not required by G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1) to make findings of fact regarding the fee award. Carswell v. Hendersonville Country Club,

                    that many small, closely held corporations do not regularly prepare formal financial statements unless required by banks, suppliers or other third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 16.20 does not limit the financial statements to be delivered or made available to shareholders to financial statements prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles. Many small corporations have never prepared financial statements
                    on the basis of GAAP. “Cash basis” financial statements (often used in preparing the tax returns of small corporations) do not comply with GAAP. Smaller corporations that keep accrual basis records, and file their federal income tax
                    returns on that basis, frequently do not make the adjustments that may be required to present their financial statements on a GAAP basis. Internally or externally prepared financial statements prepared on the basis of other accounting
                    practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, including tax returns filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (if that is all that is prepared), will suffice for these types of corporations and they may satisfy
                    their obligations under section 16.20 by delivering or making available the requested financial statements in whatever form that they have been prepared for other purposes. If a corporation does prepare financial statements on a GAAP
                    basis for any purpose for the particular year, however, it must send or make available those statements to the requesting shareholder as provided by section 16.20(a).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last sentence of section 16.20(a) requires that if the financial statements to be delivered or made available have been reported upon by a public accountant, that report must be furnished. Section 16.20(a) refers to a “public accountant.” The same
                    terminology is used in section 8.30 (standards of conduct for directors). In various states different terms are employed to identify those persons who are permitted under the state licensing requirements to act as professional accountants.
                    Phrases like “independent public accountant,” “certified public accountant,” “public accountant,” and others may be used. In adopting the term “public accountant,” the Act uses the words in a general sense to refer to any class or
                    classes of persons who, under the applicable requirements of a particular jurisdiction, are professionally entitled to practice accountancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Failure to comply with the requirements of section 16.20 does not adversely affect the existence or good standing of the corporation. Rather, failure to comply gives an aggrieved shareholder rights to compel compliance or to obtain damages, if they can
                    be established, under general principles of law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A shareholder may also seek access to the financial statements of the corporation through the inspection rights established in section 16.02.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In establishing restrictions with respect to confidentiality, use or distribution that are reasonable under the circumstances, a corporation may consider a number of factors, including the potential competitive harm to the corporation and its other shareholders
                    that could result if the confidential financial information were used to compete with the corporation or disclosed to third parties such as competitors. As provided in section 16.20(d)(2), a corporation may withhold delivery or making
                    available its financial statements to a requesting shareholder if it reasonably determines that the shareholder’s request is not made in good faith and for a proper purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a corporation fails to comply with section 16.20(b) in a timely manner the judicial remedy of 16.20(e) directs the court to handle the proceeding on an expedited basis to discourage dilatory tactics to avoid or delay delivery or access to financial
                    statements, but does not require the court to resolve these issues on a summary basis. Section 16.20(e), like section 16.04, establishes a sanction against unreasonable delay or refusal to deliver or provide access to financial statements
                    by imposing on the corporation the shareholder’s expenses in obtaining the court’s order unless the corporation can establish that the shareholder had been unwilling to agree to reasonable restrictions on the confidentiality, use or
                    distribution of the requested financial statements or the corporation had reasonably determined that the shareholder’s request was not made in good faith or for a proper purpose.

                <p>
                    Prior to the 2021 amendments, G.S. 55-16-20 required corporations to provide shareholders with annual financial statements that included a balance sheet, income statement, a statement of cash flows, and, if financial statements are regularly prepared
                    in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the annual financial statements were also required to be prepared on a GAAP basis. Annual financial statements that were reported on by a public accountant were
                    also required to include the accountant’s report, and annual financial statements not reported on by a public accountant were required to include a statement of the president (or other person responsible for accounting records) (1)
                    stating the person’s reasonable belief whether the statements were prepared on a GAAP basis, and if not, the basis of preparation and (2) describing any respects in which the statements were prepared on a basis inconsistent with the
                    prior year’s annual financial statements. Prior to the 2021 amendments, G.S. 55-16-20(d) required the corporation to mail the annual financial statements to each shareholder, or provide written notice that the financial statements
                    are available, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each fiscal year (although the failure to do so may not serve as the basis for a claim for damages by a shareholder, unless the failure was in bad faith).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complying with these extensive requirements imposed a substantial time and resource burden on closely held, small and mid-sized corporations. In recognition of this burden, the Model Act was amended in 2016 to (1) remove the requirement that a corporation
                    regularly prepare financial statements for delivery to shareholders (while retaining a requirement that financial statements be made available on request, as further described below) and (2) eliminate the statutorily-imposed standards
                    for preparation of financial statements. Beyond the reduced burden on corporations, these changes are an acknowledgment that the nature and complexity of a corporation’s business (including the requirements of third parties, like banks,
                    suppliers and taxing authorities) should be the primary driver of the form and presentation of the corporation’s financial statements, rather than a corporate statute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2021 revisions to G.S. 55-16-20 reflect this same approach. Specifically, in lieu of a requirement that the corporation maintain and mail financial statements on an annual basis, the changes to G.S. 55-16-20(a) and (b) require the corporation to make
                    financial statements available within five (5) business days of a qualified shareholder’s request (with flexibility on the method by which they may be made available). Likewise, the changes to G.S. 55-16-20 eliminate the statutory
                    standards for preparation of the financial statements, and the required presidential (or other) statement about the basis of preparation if financial statements are non-GAAP. This approach allows the corporation to determine the form
                    and basis of its financial statements in light of the size, nature and needs of its business, while ensuring that qualified shareholders retain rights of access to key financial information to allow them to monitor and evaluate their
                    investment.

                    This section has no counterpart in prior law. The section modifies the Model Act by exempting “public corporations” (i.e., those required to file reports under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), because they are subject to comprehensive
                    federal disclosure requirements which include indemnification arrangements and material loans or similar transactions with executive officers, directors and five percent shareholders. G.S. 55-8-57 was added to the Model Act’s list
                    in subsection (a), and an exemption was added in subsection (b) for transactions or plans previously approved by the shareholders.

                    The requirement relating to the annual report that each corporation must submit to the secretary of state has been modified in section 16.22 in an effort to make it a limited information document for use by the secretary of state, members of the general
                    public, and shareholders. The purpose of the annual report is to show the location of the principal office of the corporation, the names and business addresses of its directors and principal officers, the general nature of the corporation’s
                    business, and its capital structure. It permits members of the general public to ascertain the identity of the corporation and communicate directly with it. It also establishes the alternative to the registered office for service of
                    process and related matters. The “principal office” of the corporation is defined as the location of its executive office in section 1.40.
                </p>

                    The reference to “principal officers” in section 16.22(a)(4) is intended to simplify reporting requirements of corporations with very large numbers of employees who have some managerial responsibility and who, for business reasons, are designated as officers.
                    The “principal officers” of a corporation include at least the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, and the officers performing the traditional functions performed by the corporate secretary and treasurer,
                    no matter what their designation.

                    The annual report is required of both domestic corporations and foreign corporations qualified to transact business in the state. The failure to file the annual report, like the failure to satisfy other mandatory requirements of the Act, is a ground for
                    administrative dissolution or revocation of the certificate of authority to transact business.

                <p>
                    This section requires an annual report to the Secretary of State. The prior North Carolina law contained no such requirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section differs from the Model Act by expressly providing that it will not apply to professional corporations (notwithstanding G.S. 55B-3) and by not requiring disclosure of a corporation’s authorized shares or its outstanding shares. Subdivision
                    (a)(4) adds a requirement that the titles of officers be included in the annual report, so the Model Act requirement for listing directors’ names and business addresses was placed in a separate subdivision (a)(4a). Also, subsection
                    (c) is slightly different from the Model Act in the filing deadlines and in requiring the Secretary of State to distribute forms for the annual report each year. Subsection (e), which is not in the Model Act, allows the filing of amendments
                    to any previously filed annual reports.

                <p>
                    The fundamental principle underlying section 17.01 is that the revised Model Act should ultimately be made fully applicable to all existing business corporations as well as to all new business corporations formed after the effective date of the new statute.
                    It is undesirable to “grandfather” existing corporations under earlier statutes since that results in the permanent coexistence of two different and overlapping systems of corporation law, with resulting confusion. This is particularly
                    true of the revised Model Act, which builds directly on the experience of many years with existing corporation statutes and contains few major substantive changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 17.01 applies this basic principle in its broadest sense by making the revised Act applicable as of its “effective date” (prescribed in section 17.06) to all domestic corporations formed under general statutes for corporations for profit. This
                    includes all prior general business corporation acts, but not statutes providing for not-for-profit corporations or associations, or corporations formed for the purpose of engaging in a business for which the state has provided a separate
                    incorporation procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 17.01 applies the revised Model Act to all corporations to which that application is constitutionally permissible. In view of the universal adoption of “reservation of power” clauses in all states for more than a century, there are very few active
                    business corporations to which this Act will not be applicable under this section.

                    The provisions of former G.S. 55-3(a) and (b) were brought forward with modifications as subsections (a) and (b) of this section in lieu of the Model Act’s provisions. In subsection (a) the words “except to the extent the corporation is expressly excepted
                    by this act from its operation” were substituted for the words “unless the corporation is expressly excepted from the operation hereof” in former G.S. 55-3(a) to provide for partial exceptions and to make it clear that the referenced
                    exceptions are only those in the North Carolina Business Corporation Act itself. In subsection (b) the words “not for profit” were inserted after “corporation” to limit the prohibition only to corporations not formed for profit. The
                    term “not for profit” is broader than “nonprofit” and was used in subsection (a) in order to “grandfather” those not for profit corporations having capital stock that were formed prior to the enactment of the Business Corporation Act
                    in 1955.

                    Section 17.02 makes the revised Model Act applicable on its effective date to all foreign corporations that are qualified to transact business in the state on that date. But these corporations need not refile and obtain new certificates of authority under
                    the Act. While chapter 15 of the revised Model Act may change the rules applicable to foreign corporations in some states, these changes are not of a type that require a transition period. It is therefore recommended that only a single
                    effective date be provided for the application of the Act to foreign corporations and that delayed effective dates for specific provisions in this regard are unnecessary.

                    Former G.S. 55-3(c) was brought forward with minor clarifications as subsection (a) in lieu of the Model Act’s provisions, except that subdivision 17.03(a)(4) of the Model Act was rewritten as subsection (b). The broad term “corporate action” was substituted
                    for the words “reorganization, or dissolution” used in the Model Act in order to be sure that it covers all fundamental changes, including mergers.

                    The Model Act is intended to be a complete substitute for earlier statutes of general applicability to business corporations and it is contemplated that all these statutes should normally be repealed when the revised Model Act is enacted. A few states
                    in the past have retained portions of earlier statutes while enacting integrated codifications of business corporation law. This practice is generally undesirable since it tends to cause unnecessary confusion in determining the applicable
                    law as well as creating possible internal statutory conflicts.

                <p>
                    Many states have enacted statutes providing special incorporation and regulatory provisions for corporations engaged in specific businesses, like banking and insurance. These specialized statutes should not be included in the list of statutes repealed
                    by section 17.05. Many of these specialized statutes expressly “borrow” provisions from the general corporation act to fill in gaps or to provide applicable rules when the specialized statute is silent. As a general matter, it would
                    be desirable to ensure that these statutes are amended to refer specifically to the present Act rather than to an earlier statute; an appropriate provision would apply this Act to all these corporations except to the extent the specialized
                    statute expressly provides that a different principle should be applicable.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever the charter of a corporation created under the laws of the State of North Carolina has, on account of failure to make any report or return or to pay any tax or fee for such length of time as to lose its charter, and where thereafter, under the
                    laws of the State of North Carolina, a new charter is issued, in the same name as the original corporation, and on behalf of the same corporation, such new corporation shall succeed to the same properties, to the same rights as the
                    original corporation before losing its charter on account of neglect hereinbefore mentioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever such new corporation shall have been created, under the laws of this State, all the title, rights and emoluments to the property held by the original corporation shall inure to the benefit of the newer corporation and the new corporation shall
                    issue its stock to the stockholders in the defunct corporation, in the same number and with the same par value held by the stockholders of the defunct corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such new corporation shall have the rights and privileges of maintaining any action or cause of action which the defunct corporation might maintain, bring or defend and to all intents and purposes the new corporation shall take the place of the defunct
                    corporation to the same intent and purposes as if the defunct corporation has never expired by reason of its failure to make the reports hereinbefore referred to. (1959, c. 1316, s. 281/2; 1973, c. 469, s. 45.)

                <p>
                    In all cases where a deed, deed of trust or other document executed by a corporation is permitted or required by law to be recorded and said deed, deed of trust or document was properly executed, acknowledged and recorded before January 1, 1977, except
                    the acknowledgment of the officer or officers of the corporation was taken in their individual capacity rather than in their capacity as officers of said corporation, said deed, deed of trust or other document shall be construed to
                    be a deed, deed of trust or other document of the same force and effect as if said acknowledgment was in every way proper. (1977, c. 40, s. 1.)
