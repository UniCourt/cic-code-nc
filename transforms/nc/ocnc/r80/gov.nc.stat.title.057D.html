        Formation of Operating Agreement. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Court denied plaintiff’s motion to dismiss defendants’ breach of fiduciary claim because the court could not say as a matter of law that the partnership agreement was or was not an operating agreement that created fiduciary duties; short period of time between the agreement and formation of the LLC suggested that the agreement concerned the LLC and the parties’ continued reliance on the agreement, even after formation of the LLCs, could indicate that they still considered the agreement to govern their relationship. Sivadhanam v. 7 Hills Learning, LLC, 2021 NCBC 53, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 74 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 8, 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act forbids the formation of an operating agreement prior to organization of the LLC itself. Sivadhanam v. 7 Hills Learning, LLC, 2021 NCBC 53, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 74 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 8, 2021).

      The Secretary of State may propound to any limited liability company that the Secretary of State has reason to believe is subject to the provisions of this Chapter, and to any manager or other company official thereof, such written interrogatories as may be necessary and proper to enable the Secretary of State to ascertain whether the limited liability company has complied with all of the provisions of this Chapter applicable to it. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, the interrogatories must be answered within 30 days after the mailing thereof, or within such additional time as the Secretary of State may fix, and the answers thereto must be full and complete and made in writing and under oath. If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they must be answered by the individual, and if directed to a limited liability company, they must be answered by a manager or other company official thereof. The Secretary of State shall certify to the Attorney General for such action all interrogatories and answers thereto that disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter requiring or permitting action by the Attorney General.

       In addition to the recourse that the Secretary of State may have under G.S. 57D-6-06 and Part 3 of Article 7 of this Chapter to administratively dissolve an LLC or revoke the certificate of authority of the foreign LLC, if a limited liability company knowingly fails or refuses to answer truthfully and fully within the time prescribed in this Chapter interrogatories propounded by the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, the Secretary of State may suspend its articles of organization or its certificate of authority to do business in this State. The Secretary of State shall immediately notify by mail the limited liability company of its suspension. The powers, privileges, and franchises conferred on the limited liability company by the articles of organization or the certificate of authority terminate upon their suspension. Any act performed or attempted to be performed during the period of suspension is invalid and of no effect unless and to the extent the Secretary of State reinstates the limited liability company.

       The Secretary of State shall reinstate a limited liability company upon the limited liability company fully complying with its obligations under G.S. 57D-1-31, paying all State taxes, fees, and penalties due from it (which total amount due may be computed, for years before and after the suspension, in the same manner as if the suspension had not taken place) and paying to the Secretary of State twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to cover the cost of reinstatement. Upon reinstatement of an LLC’s articles of organization or a foreign LLC’s certificate of authority by the Secretary of State, (i) the limited liability company may again exercise its rights, privileges, and franchises in this State, and (ii) the Secretary of State shall make the appropriate entry thereof on the records of the Secretary of State. The entry of reinstatement in the records of the Secretary of State relates back to and takes effect as of the date of the suspension by the Secretary of State, and the limited liability company may resume conducting its business as if the suspension had never occurred, subject to the rights of any person who relied, to that person’s prejudice, on the suspension. The Secretary of State shall immediately notify by mail the limited liability company of the reinstatement.

Application for the receiver may be made in a civil action to which all interest owners are made parties. The applicant may serve persons whom the applicant either is unable to locate or are unknown by publication made in the same manner as the publication of notice under G.S. 57D-6-11. A guardian ad litem may be appointed for any interest owners who are infants or incompetent. The receiver shall enter into a bond if the court requires one and shall give notice to creditors by publication or otherwise as the court may prescribe. Any creditor who fails to file a claim with the receiver within the time set will be barred of the right to participate in the distribution of the assets. The receiver may (i) sell the property interests of the limited liability company on such terms and in such manner as the court may order, (ii) apply the proceeds to the payments of any debt of the limited liability company, and (iii) distribute the remainder among the interest owners in accordance with the manner in which liquidating distributions are to be made by the limited liability company. Amounts due to any interest owner who is unknown or whose whereabouts are unknown are to be paid to the office of the clerk of the superior court and disbursed according to law. If the records of the limited liability company are lost or do not reflect the owners of the property interests, the court shall determine the owners from the best evidence available, and the receiver will be protected in acting in accordance with the court’s finding. This proceeding is authorized for the sole purpose of providing a procedure for disposing of the assets of the limited liability company by payment of its debts and by the transfer to its interest owners, or their representatives, of their shares of the limited liability company’s remaining assets.

       Superior court erred by ordering a beneficiary to transfer the assets of a limited liability company to a trust because there was a prior valid and binding order in the district court prohibiting such transfers in the beneficiary’s equitable distribution action against a co-trustee, who was her husband; the beneficiary’s trust pursuit claim, which was brought initially before the clerk of superior court and subsequently before the superior court, sought to do what the beneficiary had specifically agreed not to do, transfer title to real estate during the pendency of the equitable distribution action, and the judgment of the superior court ordering the transfer of title of real estate was in direct contravention of the injunction previously entered by the district court.

       Because the purpose of an owner’s affidavit in a mechanic’s lien case was to recite facts of which the affiant had personal knowledge, not to conduct business on behalf of the company or to file an answer on its behalf, and the company appeared through counsel for all purposes other than to attest to the truthfulness of facts, it is doubtful whether written authorization under G.S. 57C-3-24(a) (now repealed) was required; assuming, however, that the statute required written authorization for the affidavit filed in this case, there was no requirement that the existence of the authorization be recited in the affidavit. An order establishing a mechanic’s lien was improper because both of the owner’s verified answers were valid and sufficient. T.W. Herring Invs., LLC v. Atl. Builders Group, Inc., 186 Md.

       Regardless of whether G.S. 57C-3-30(b) (now repealed) restricted the circumstances in which a member of a limited liability company could be added as a party to a lawsuit, G.S. 57C-3-30(a) (now repealed) clearly anticipated that a member who was also a manager, director, executive, or any combination thereof might be made a defendant and become personally liable by reason of his own acts or conduct.

       Lawyer, who was a member of a professional limited liability company, owed no duty to a trustee and a beneficiary for the misconduct of his partner, and summary judgment for the lawyer in a claim by trustee and beneficiary based on the partner’s misconduct in dealing with an estate and trust was proper because the Limited Liability Company Act did not require the lawyer to investigate his partner absent actual knowledge of the misconduct.

       Where a member of a limited liability company (LLC) claimed that another member fraudulently spent the LLC’s assets, the debtor, the sole managing member of the LLC, was not personally liable to the member because, pursuant to G.S. 57C-3-30(a) (now repealed), the debtor’s status as a managing member did not make him personally liable for the LLC’s debts.

        Forced Sale of Judgment Debtor’s Membership Interests Properly Refused. —

      <p>
       Trial court properly ordered defendant debtor’s distributions and allocations from certain limited liability companies in which the debtor had membership interests to be applied to satisfy a judgment, and properly denied plaintiff assignee’s motion to order the membership interests to be seized and sold, because pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-03 (now repealed), the trial court was allowed to charge the membership interests with payment of the judgment. Nevertheless, such charging did not entitle the assignee to become a member or exercise a member’s rights, and therefore, because forcing the sale of the membership interests to satisfy the debt would have entailed the assignee becoming a member of the limited liability companies, a forced sale like that otherwise allowed by G.S. 1-362 was prohibited.

       Equitable estoppel could not be used in effect to create an operating agreement governing withdrawal pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-06 (now repealed) from a professional limited liability company that had no operating agreement; thus, defendants’ argument that, at the time plaintiffs filed their derivative claims, they had already withdrawn from the limited liability company, were not members of it, and did not have standing to file a derivative suit, was without merit as no written operating agreement existed.

       Operating Agreement clearly provided that debtor’s ownership interest shall be 50 percent, and other provisions of the Operating Agreement also corroborated debtor’s 50 percent ownership interest; furthermore, the equal ownership of debtor and the other member-manager was also reflected in the company’s tax returns for years 1997 through 2006. For purposes of G.S. 57C-6-02(2) (now repealed), the dispute regarding debtor’s ownership constituted a deadlock in management. In re Klingerman, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 4555 (Bankr. E.D.N.C.

       Trial court properly ordered the judicial dissolution of the companies pursuant to G.S. 57D-6-02(2)(i) without giving defendants the opportunity to purchase plaintiff’s interests as they were not entitled to do so; the parties had no contact for approximately six years and the level of acrimony and distrust between the parties was extraordinary, such that it was not practicable to conduct business in accordance with the operating agreements.

       Shareholder’s claims of professional embarrassment and impairment of his interest in a stock were insufficient grounds to merit dissolution of the LLC under the statute; there was no basis to conclude that liquidation of the LLC was necessary to protect the shareholder’s rights and interests on the grounds that the LLC may face sanctions for the other shareholder’s derivative actions, and the shareholder failed to meet the requirements of the statute.

If, at the time the LLC applies for reinstatement, the name of the LLC is not distinguishable from the name of another entity authorized to be used under G.S. 55D-21, then the LLC must change its name to a name that is distinguishable on the records of the Secretary of State from the name of the other entity before the Secretary of State may prepare a certificate of reinstatement. The effect of reinstatement of an LLC is the same as for a domestic corporation under G.S. 55-14-22.

      <p>
       Attorney who was a manager and a member of a law firm that was a limited liability company (LLC) had standing under G.S. 57C-8-01 (now repealed) to file a derivative action on behalf of the LLC, by sufficiently alleging that the attorney demanded that the attorney’s partner who was a comanager and member of the LLC share the proceeds from the cases retained through the LLC. Crouse v. Mineo, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 232, 658 S.E.2d 33, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 546 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable estoppel could not be used in effect to create an operating agreement governing withdrawal pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-06 (now repealed) from a professional limited liability company that had no operating agreement; thus, defendants’ argument that, at the time plaintiffs filed their derivative claims, they had already withdrawn from the limited liability company, were not members of it, and did not have standing to file a derivative suit, was without merit as no written operating agreement existed. Mitchell, Brewer, Richardson, Adams, Burge &amp; Boughman, PLLC v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 705 S.E.2d 757, <cite class="nc_code">2011 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the operating agreement, including the provision governing testamentary transfers to spouses, permitted admission to membership absent compliance with a particular section of the company’s operating agreement, and the complaint did not allege that plaintiff, a company member’s widow, satisfied those conditions for admission to membership; thus, she failed to adequately alleged that she was a member of the company with standing to assert derivative claims on its behalf.
