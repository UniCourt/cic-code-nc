        Duty to Protect from Unreasonable Risk of Physical Harm. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The proprietor of an inn or motel, although not an insurer of the safety of his guests, even his infant guests, is under an affirmative duty to protect his guests from an unreasonable risk of physical harm. Waugh v. Duke Corp., 248 F. Supp. 626, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6393 (M.D.N.C. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The duty of an innkeeper to a guest who is an infant is a greater duty

       than that owing to his adult guests and he is bound to consider whether his premises, although safe enough for an adult, present any reasonably avoidable dangers to his infant guest. Waugh v. Duke Corp., 248 F. Supp. 626, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6393 (M.D.N.C. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a child of tender years is accepted as a guest, the inexperience and the natural tendencies of such a child become a part of the situation and must be considered by the innkeeper. This does not mean that the innkeeper becomes the nurse of the child, or assumes its control when accompanied by its parents, but only that he is bound to consider whether his premises, though safe enough for an adult, present any reasonably avoidable dangers to the child guest. Waugh v. Duke Corp., 248 F. Supp. 626, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6393 (M.D.N.C. 1966).

       An innkeeper is required to give warning of hidden perils. His duty to give such warning is increased when infant guests are present. Waugh v. Duke Corp., 248 F. Supp. 626, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6393 (M.D.N.C. 1966).

       An innkeeper, by failure to warn an infant guest of the hidden danger of a glass panel or to place thereon such markings as would indicate the presence of the glass to infant or failure to construct guards around the panels, was negligent.

      </p>
      <p>
       A public inn or hotel is a public house of entertainment for all who choose to visit it, and where all transient persons who may choose to come will be received as guests, for compensation; and it does not lose its character as such by reason of its being located at a summer resort or a watering place, or by taking some as boarders by a special contract or for a definite time. Holstein v. Phillips &amp; Sims, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 366</cite>, 59 S.E. 1037, 1907 N.C. LEXIS 58 (1907).

      <p>
       A boardinghouse is as well known and as distinguishable from every other house in every city, village, and the country as an inn or tavern. It is a house where the business of keeping boarders generally is carried on, and which is held out by the owner or keeper as a place where boarders are kept. State v. McRae, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 712</cite>, 86 S.E. 1039, 1915 N.C. LEXIS 470 (1915).

       It is the publicly holding a place out as one where all transient persons who may choose to come will be received as guests for compensation that is the principal distinction between a hotel and a boardinghouse.

       In 16 A. and E. Enc. (2d Ed.), it is said: “The essential difference between a boarder and a guest at an inn lies in the character in which the party comes — that is, whether he is a transient person or not, and, accordingly, one who stops at an inn as a transient or a guest, with all the rights, privileges, and liberties incident to that station. On the other hand, one who seeks accommodation with a view to permanency, as to make the place his home for the time being, is not a guest, but a boarder. The length of his stay, however, is not of itself ordinarily decisive, for he will continue to be a guest as long as he remains in the transitory condition of that relation.” Holstein v. Phillips &amp; Sims, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 366</cite>, 59 S.E. 1037, 1907 N.C. LEXIS 58 (1907).

      <p>
       Guests of a hotel, and travelers or other persons entering it with the bona fide intent of becoming guests, cannot be lawfully prevented from going in, or be put out, by force, after entrance, provided they are able to pay the charges and tender the money necessary for that purpose, if requested by the landlord, unless they be persons of bad or suspicious character, or of vulgar habits, or so objectionable to the patrons of the house, on account of the race to which they belong, that it would injure the business to admit them to all portions of the house, or unless they attempt to take advantage of the freedom of the hotel to injure the landlord’s chances of profit derived either from his inn or any other business incidental to or connected with its management and constituting a part of the provision for the wants or pleasure of his patrons. State v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 766</cite>, 11 S.E. 478, 1890 N.C. LEXIS 383 (1890).

       The board rule laid down by Wharton (1 Cr.

For so doing, he can justify his conduct on a prosecution for assault and battery. State v. Steele, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 766</cite>, 11 S.E. 478, 1890 N.C. LEXIS 383 (1890).

       An innkeeper has, unquestionably, the right to establish a newsstand or a barbershop in his hotel, and to exclude persons who come for the purpose of vending newspapers or books, or of soliciting employment as barbers, and, in order to render his business more lucrative, he may establish a laundry or a livery stable in connection with his hotel, or an innkeeper may contract with the proprietor of a livery stable in the vicinity to secure for the latter, as far as he legitimately can, the patronage of his guests in that line for a per centum of the proceeds or profits derived by such owner of vehicles and horses from dealing with the patrons of the public house. After concluding such contracts, the innkeeper may make, and, after personal notice to violators, enforce a rule excluding from his hotel the agents and representatives of other livery stables who enter to solicit the patronage of his guests.

       The decisions of this State are to the effect that, in the absence of statutory regulation, the keeper of a public inn, or hotel, which is the modern and more frequently used term, is responsible to his guest for the safety of the latter’s goods, chattels, and money, when placed infra hospitum and which he has with him for the purposes of his journey. The proprietor is held to be an insurer to the extent that he must make good to the guest all loss or damage arising from any cause except the act of God or the public enemy, or the fault of the guest himself or his agents or servants.

       The innkeeper is not insurer of his guest’s personal safety, but his liability does extend to injuries received by the guest from being placed in an unsafe room. This is a matter peculiarly within the innkeeper’s knowledge and entirely beyond the control of the guest. In that particular he is peculiarly within the innkeeper’s power and protection. Patrick v. Springs, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. 270</cite>, 70 S.E. 395, 1911 N.C. LEXIS 256 (1911).

       as required by this section are clear: rather than benefiting from the protection afforded by the statute, the innkeeper must look to the common law to define its duties and liabilities, and the common-law rule in North Carolina is that the innkeeper is strictly liable for the loss of a guest’s property, except in a few rare instances, such as where such loss is occasioned by the guest’s own negligence.
