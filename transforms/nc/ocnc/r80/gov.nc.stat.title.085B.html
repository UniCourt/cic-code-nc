     The Commission, in its discretion, determines that, based upon the evidence presented, justice would be better served by allowing compensation to be paid without first requiring the aggrieved party to obtain a judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction.

    If an auctioneer travels into a city or county in which he does not maintain a regular place of business and sells or auctions property owned by him, he must obtain an itinerant merchant license pursuant to G.S. 105-53(d), as well as comply with any ordinances of the particular city or county governing itinerant merchants.

   <p>
    An auctioneer is not deemed to be an itinerant merchant if he travels into a city or county in which he does not maintain a regular place of business and auctions merchandise belonging to another person, whether or not that person maintains a regular place of business in the particular city or county. Therefore, such an auctioneer would not be required to comply with G.S. 105-53(d) or any local ordinances of the particular city or county governing itinerant merchants. However, if the owner of the goods to be auctioned off does not maintain a regular place of business in the particular city or county, that person would be required to comply with G.S. 105-53(d) and any local ordinances governing itinerant merchants.
