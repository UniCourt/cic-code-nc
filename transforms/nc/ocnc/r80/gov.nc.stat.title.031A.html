      </p>
      <p>
       The apparent purpose of the full statute is to bar the benefits of certain types of property rights and interests otherwise accruing to a person but for his wrongful acts or a divorce or annulment. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 244</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 542, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 2551 (1987).

        Abandonment. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming arguendo that the clerk could properly re-date the assignment and deficiency judgment, the trial court erred in concluding that appellant willfully and without just cause abandoned the decedent; to the extent that appellant’s divorce filings indicated a willful desire to end her relationship, the evidence did not support a conclusion of abandonment without just cause. Appellant was not the wrongdoer and was not to suffer the consequence of being barred her spousal rights. In re Estate of Meetze, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 847 S.E.2d 220, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 539 (2020).

       The right of the widow to take under her husband’s will that which he saw fit to bequeath or devise to her is not among the rights which this section declares forfeited by her abandonment of him.

      </p>
      <p>
       Neither G.S. 50-11 which provides that “all rights arising out of the marriage shall cease and determine,” nor this section which bars rights to “any rights or interests in the property of the other spouse” discloses a legislative intent that divorce should annul or revoke the beneficiary designation in a garden-variety insurance certificate. DeVane v. Travelers Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 174 S.E.2d 146, <cite class="nc_code">1970 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1526 (1970).

        Presumption of Adultery. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Adultery is presumed if the following can be shown:
   (1) the adulterous disposition, or inclination, of the parties; and (2) the opportunity created to satisfy their mutual adulterous inclinations. In re Trogdon, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 143</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 897, 1991 N.C. LEXIS 741 (1991).

        Wife’s Behavior as Inference of Adultery. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A married woman’s refusal to testify about the nature of her relationship with two unmarried men, with whom she admitted cohabiting, and her failure to refute the charge of adultery logically gave rise to an inference of adultery. In re Trogdon, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 143</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 897, 1991 N.C. LEXIS 741 (1991).

        “Living in Adultery.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the legislative history and the purpose of this section, “living in adultery” means a spouse engages in repeated acts of adultery within a reasonable period of time preceding the death of her spouse; therefore, “living in adultery” requires a showing of something more than “committing adultery,” or a single act of adultery, and something less than “residing” in adultery because the latter construction would permit spouses to engage in habitual adultery with those with whom they do not reside and nevertheless be qualified to administer their decedent spouse’s estate under section 28A-6-1. In re Estate of Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 528 S.E.2d 618, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 422 (2000).

       Subdivision (b)(6) is inapplicable to separation agreements entered into by parties contemplating a separation or divorce from a valid marriage.

      <p>
       The surviving spouse does not lose his right of inheritance because the claim arose on account of the negligence of the surviving spouse since negligence is not one of the grounds for forfeiture of marital rights as set out in this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       Summary judgment was appropriate for the defendant under this section
   
   where the evidence failed to support a finding of willful abandonment of the deceased, and that any failure to care for, or cohabit with, her was due to the advanced age and deteriorating health of both spouses.

       In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where a widow, who was the decedent’s sole intestate beneficiary, had abandoned the decedent before his death, she was not entitled to a wrongful death recovery, and since the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only received their original percentage, there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim.

       Where decedent’s ex-spouse abandoned her interest in the decedent’s estate at the time of death, decedent’s siblings were entitled to share in any wrongful death proceeds, distribution was dictated by the laws of intestacy, and decedent’s sister, as administratrix had standing to file the action.

       When the legislature, in G.S. 28A-18-2, provided that the proceeds of an action for wrongful death “shall be disposed of as provided in the Intestate Succession Act,” and when it provided in G.S. 97-40 that the order of priority among claimants to death benefits payable under the Workers’ Compensation Act “shall be governed by the general law applicable to the distribution of the personal estate of persons dying intestate,” it had in mind the same law; i.e., the Intestate Succession Act as modified by this Chapter, entitled, “Acts Barring Property Rights.” Williford v.

      <p>
       G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from taking anything from the abandoned child’s intestate estate, was ambiguous because nowhere in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 31A</a></cite> was the term “child” defined, nor was the meaning of the term clear from its context, so “child” here could reasonably mean either a minor offspring or an offspring of any age. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 1097 (2003).

      <p>
       <b>
        Meaning of Abandonment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Abandonment is defined as any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Lessard v. Lessard, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 334 S.E.2d 475, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4022 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 546</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 522, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2146 (1986).
      </p>

       Logically, G.S. 31A-2, prohibiting a parent who abandoned a child from taking anything from the child’s intestate estate, had to apply to an abandonment that initially occurred while the child was a minor as a parent could not abandon an emancipated or adult child when the parent had no further responsibility for the child.

       Abandonment has been defined as willful neglect and refusal to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support; if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, and the opportunity to display filial affection, and willfully neglects to lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child.

       North Carolina Supreme Court had implicitly held that G.S. 31A-2 applied to a dispute as to a father’s rights to share in his daughter’s estate even though she was not a minor at the time of her death.

       North Carolina General Assembly adequately demonstrated an unwillingness to allow an abandoning parent to take from an abandoned adult child as the result of a mechanical application of the rules of intestate succession.

       When a deceased child’s mother filed a declaratory judgment action against the child’s father, seeking a determination of the parties’ rights to share in the child’s estate, including the proceeds of a wrongful death suit on the child’s behalf, under G.S. 31A-2, because the father did not support or communicate with the child from age four until almost age 20, the father’s motion to dismiss, under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), was properly denied; while the father resumed support of and contact with the child before the child’s death, support had to be resumed at least one year before the end of the father’s legal obligation to support the child, which ended at age 18, to apply the exception to G.S. 31A-2’s preclusion, found in G.S. 31A-2(1), so that exception did not apply to the father. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 1097 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative intent behind G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from sharing in the abandoned child’s intestate estate, was both to discourage parents from shirking their responsibility of support to their children and to prevent an abandoning parent from reaping an undeserved bonanza, and if G.S. 31A-2 had no application once a child reached majority, a parent who had abandoned his or her child would nevertheless automatically inherit if the still-abandoned child died intestate after reaching the age of 18 so such an interpretation would frustrate the statute’s purpose and effectively forgive the abandoning parent’s dereliction; G.S. 31A-2 applied to any abandoned child dying intestate regardless of the child’s age at death. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 1097 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical inquiry as to G.S. 31A-2(1), allowing a parent who had abandoned a child to share in the child’s intestate estate if the parent had resumed supporting the child, was not whether a parent could resume a relationship with a child, but whether a parent resumed its care and maintenance at least one year prior to the death of the child and continued the same until its death so the exception required that the parent resume both the care and maintenance of the child, and these requirements could not be read in the disjunctive; while “care” pertained to love and concern for the child, “maintenance” referred to the financial support of a child during minority, and North Carolina jurisprudence established that the authority of a court to require support for a normal child ceased when the legal obligation to support no longer existed so the parents’ duty to support ceased upon emancipation, and the age of emancipation was precisely fixed at 18. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 1097 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from sharing in the abandoned child’s intestate estate, pertained to the estate of a child of any age, and under the logic of that analysis — that a parent who abandoned a child should benefit from the death of the child only if the parent had resumed a parental relationship with the child — an abandoning parent who sought to come under the exception in G.S. 31A-2(1), allowing an abandoning parent to share in the abandoned child’s intestate estate if support of the child was resumed, had to renew both the care and the maintenance of the child during the child’s minority, when care and maintenance were most valuable; under the terms of the statute, the care and maintenance had to continue for a year before the child’s death so, in order to benefit from this provision, a parent had to renew such care and maintenance at least one year before the child reached the age of 18. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 1097 (2003).

       Legislative intent behind G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child, is both to discourage parents from shirking their responsibility of support to their children and to prevent an abandoning parent from reaping an undeserved bonanza, and the general assembly demonstrated its unwillingness to allow an abandoning parent to take from an abandoned adult child as the result of a mechanical application of the rules of intestate succession.

      <p>
       Where the father wilfully abandoned the care and maintenance of the deceased during the latter’s minority, this section provides that the father loses all right to intestate succession in the distribution of the personal estate of his intestate deceased child and consequently, he does not share in the death benefits for which the employer or its carrier is liable under G.S. 97-38. Smith v. Allied Exterminators, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 583</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 296, 1971 N.C. LEXIS 891 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Operative language in G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child, is nearly identical to that in G.S. 97-40, precluding the receipt of workers’ compensation benefits by an abandoning parent due to the death of an abandoned child, as both statutes provide that a parent who has abandoned the “care and maintenance” of a child loses the right to receive a specified benefit upon the child’s death, and both provide an exception when the parent has resumed the “care and maintenance” of the child at least one year prior to the child’s death or majority.

      <p>
       Exception contained in G.S. 31A-2(2) must be construed in accordance with the policy underlying <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 31A</a></cite>; the exception contained in G.S. 31A-2(2) essentially states that if a court takes away custody of a child and decides the specifics of support, then a parent should not be denied the right to participate in intestate succession if he limits his role in his child’s life to the parameters set out by a court. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Exception in G.S. 31A-2(2) to precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child essentially states that a parent should not be denied the right to participate in intestate succession if he limits his role in his child’s life to the parameters set out by a court, at least when the abandoning parent complies with the express terms of a court order requiring contribution to the support of the child, so an exception to the general rule of disinheritance is justified under such circumstances, because the legislative intent underlying G.S. 31A-2 is not effectuated by the disinheritance of a non-custodial parent who provides the court-ordered level of material support; put simply, a parent who limits his role in his child’s life to the parameters set out by a court has not shirked his responsibility to that child. so, construing G.S. 31A-2(2) to apply it only to a parent who was ordered to provide support effectuates the legislative intent behind that exception. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366, 2005 N.C. LEXIS 358 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a parent voluntarily provides adequate “care and maintenance” to a child, for purposes of G.S. 31A-2, that parent cannot be said to have abandoned the child in the first instance, and, as an exception to the general rule of disinheritance, G.S. 31A-2(2) comes into play only when a parent has failed to provide care and support of his or her own volition, so the exception provides that a parent should not be penalized for his or her failure to exceed the terms of a judicial child support order, and the statute should not be applied to the disadvantage of a parent who voluntarily provides adequate care and support. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366, 2005 N.C. LEXIS 358 (2005).

       When a father was not ordered to pay support for his child, when custody of the child was awarded to the child’s mother, and the father did not voluntarily provide an adequate level of support for the child during the 17 years following the mother’s and father’s divorce, when the child died, the father was precluded from sharing in the proceeds of the child’s estate because he wilfully abandoned her, and the exception to such preclusion in G.S. 31A-2(2), which applied to non-custodial parents who complied with court orders to support a child, did not apply to him because he was not ordered to pay support for the child, and he did not voluntarily provide an adequate amount of such support. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366, 2005 N.C. LEXIS 358 (2005).

       Trial court erred in concluding that a father did not fall within the scope of G.S. 31A-2(2) where: (1) the father was deprived of custody under the divorce decree, (2) the decree did not grant the father any visitation rights, and (3) because the district court in its divorce judgment considered the issue of child support but elected not to require the father to pay support, the father complied with the only order in existence addressing the question of child support. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C.

       G.S. 31A-2(2) provides that an abandoning parent may inherit from an abandoned child if the parent has substantially complied with all orders of the court requiring contribution to the support of the child, so, by its express language, this statutory exception to the preclusion of an abandoning parent’s inheritance from an abandoned child may not be invoked where a court order has not “required” the payment of child support.

       Trial court’s findings of fact supported its conclusion that a father wilfully abandoned the care and maintenance of his child, under G.S. 31A-2, because, even assuming the child and her mother refused to accept the father’s occasional offers of financial assistance, the trial court could reasonably find that the father’s sporadic contacts with his daughter over 17 years did not show the degree of “presence,” “love,” “care,” and “opportunity to display filial affection” that defined non-abandoning parents.

       This Article, the “slayer statute,” applies only to felonious killings;
   
   it does not prevent the common law doctrine that no person will be allowed to profit from his own wrong from being applied in actions not under its provisions.

      </p>
      <p>
       A person who has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter of another has not been convicted of a “willful” killing within the meaning of subdivision (3)a and thus is not a slayer who is barred by this Chapter from receiving the proceeds of a life insurance policy on the life of the deceased.

        Estate of Decedent Determined at Date of Her Actual Death. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This section makes no attempt artificially to alter the date of the death of the decedent but provides instead that the actual date of death of the slayer is to be disregarded. Therefore, if the language of the statute is followed, the estate of the decedent is determined at the date of her actual death, and the law calls the roll of the class immediately as of that time; those who can then answer, take. Porth v. Porth, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 485, 165 S.E.2d 508, <cite class="nc_code">1969 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1609 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides in part that, for purposes of distributing the estate of the decedent, “the slayer shall be deemed to have died immediately prior to the death of the decedent.” In view of this express statutory presumption, it is clear that the words “the estate of the wife” as the same were used in former G.S. 31A-5(2) meant the estate of the murdered wife as the same came into existence at the instant of her death, and the title to the entireties property at that moment passed to those persons who would be entitled to succeed to her interest in such property as of the moment of her death if she had in fact survived her husband, subject only to recognized right to “hold” the property during his lifetime.

       This section preserved the common law,
   
   both substantively and procedurally, as to all acts not specifically provided for in this Chapter. Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 47</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 563, 1975 N.C. LEXIS 1065 (1975); Lofton v. Lofton, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C.

       This Chapter does not wholly supplant the common law, which prevents a beneficiary in a policy of life insurance whose culpable negligence caused the death of the insured from collecting the proceeds of the policy. Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 47</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 563, 1975 N.C. LEXIS 1065 (1975); Smith v. Independent Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 269, 258 S.E.2d 864, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3068 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this Chapter do not completely supplant the common-law principle prevailing in North Carolina that a person should not be allowed to profit by his own wrong. Lofton v. Lofton, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 203, 215 S.E.2d 861, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2010 (1975).

       Father’s failure to pay child support when a divorce court considered the issue of child support but decided not to order him to pay child support was consistent with the only pertinent order and with the mother’s wishes and could not be deemed wrong in the sense of the public policy expressed in G.S. 31A-15 and could not prevent the father from sharing in his daughter’s intestate estate under G.S. 31A-2(2). In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1764 (2003), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366, 2005 N.C. LEXIS 358 (2005).

       If the party seeking to disqualify the beneficiary cannot proceed under this Chapter,
   
   as when the jury in the criminal proceeding finds the wrongdoer guilty of involuntary manslaughter, then his only remaining remedy is to proceed under the common law. Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 47</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 563, 1975 N.C. LEXIS 1065 (1975).
