       § 122C-2.
    Policy.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The policy of the State is to assist individuals with needs for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services in ways consistent with the dignity, rights, and responsibilities of all North Carolina citizens. Within available
                    resources it is the obligation of State and local government to provide mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services through a delivery system designed to meet the needs of clients in the least restrictive,
                    therapeutically most appropriate setting available and to maximize their quality of life. It is further the obligation of State and local government to provide community-based services when such services are appropriate, unopposed
                    by the affected individuals, and can be reasonably accommodated within available resources and taking into account the needs of other persons for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    State and local governments shall develop and maintain a unified system of services centered in area authorities or county programs. The public service system will strive to provide a continuum of services for clients while considering the availability
                    of services in the private sector. Within available resources, State and local government shall ensure that the following core services are available:

                <p>
                    Within available resources, the State shall provide funding to support services to targeted populations, except that the State and counties shall provide matching funds for entitlement program services as required by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As used in this Chapter, the phrase “within available resources” means State funds appropriated and non-State funds and other resources appropriated, allocated or otherwise made available for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse
                    services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The furnishing of services to implement the policy of this section requires the cooperation and financial assistance of counties, the State, and the federal government.

                        When the legislature in 1985, deleted the term “recent past” and substituted the term “relevant past,” the Court of Appeals construed this legislative amendment as an effort on the part of the legislature to clarify the meaning of the statute, not to

                        Statutory language establishes a two-prong test for dangerousness to self. The first prong addresses self-care ability regarding one’s daily affairs. The second prong, which also must be satisfied for involuntary commitment to result, mandates a specific
                        finding of a probability of serious physical debilitation resulting from the more general finding of lack of self-caring ability. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537,

                        Trial court properly found that a complainant, whom the court recommitted for inpatient treatment, was a danger to the complainant because there was a reasonable possibility that the complainant would have suffered serious physical debilitation in the

                        The trial court correctly found the appellant “dangerous to others,” under this section and G.S. 122C-276.1, in spite of the appellant’s objection that murders which happened 10 years in the past should not be considered because of their “remoteness,”
                        where, from both evidentiary and medical perspectives, the nature of his crimes was more important than their timing, and where the court’s findings on his dangerousness were also rooted in additional evidence unrelated to his
                        prior crimes, including (1) his past and present mental illness, (2) his behavior since July 17, 1988 (including “slaw incident” during which he became upset and angry with his job supervisor over his co-worker’s premature disposal
                        of coleslaw from the hospital grill where he was employed), and (3) his high likelihood of post-release relapse into multi-substance abuse, which all experts agreed was a trigger for his 1988 psychosis during which he killed four
                        people and wounded several others. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 532 S.E.2d 553, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 820 (2000).

                        the involuntary commitment because (1) the trial court’s findings reflected the individual’s mental illness, but they did not indicate that the individual’s illness or any of the individual’s symptoms would persist and endanger
                        the individual within the near future pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(a)(1); and (2) the trial court’s findings were insufficient to support its conclusion that the individual was dangerous to others pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(b).

                        Trial court did not err by considering mental health records of a mother contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence in proceedings to terminate her parental rights, because the mental health records challenged by the mother

                        Involuntary commitment order was error because the order contained insufficient findings, as specifically required by G.S. 122C-268(j), to support the trial court’s determination that the patient was dangerous to himself and to others; statements in a
                        physician’s report, incorporated by the order, that the patient was a 56-year-old white male, with a history of alcohol abuse/dependence, admitted with manic episode, and who continued to be symptomatic with limited insight regarding
                        his illness, were not sufficient to support the trial court’s findings. In re Booker, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 433, 667 S.E.2d 302, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1808

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in ordering the involuntary commitment of the respondent because the evidence in the record on appeal was insufficient to satisfy the statutory criteria since there was no evidence that the respondent’s refusal to take his medication
                        created a serious health risk in the near future, an expert’s only testimony concerning the respondent’s “nourishment” was that he lost some “unknown amount” of weight, but that his current weight was safe, and the respondent’s
                        threat to sue his guardian and his alleged aggressive, but non-violent, actions toward the hospital staff could not be viewed as a threat to inflict “serious bodily harm.” In re W.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in involuntarily committing the respondent because, while the trial court’s findings reflected the respondent’s mental illness, there was no finding of the respondent suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless
                        adequate treatment was given or that there was a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment was given. In re J.P.S., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 823 S.E.2d 917,

                        There was no evidence supporting the trial court’s finding that respondent was dangerous to others because the psychologist did not state any opinion that respondent was dangerous to others, only that she was a danger to herself, and the hospital witness
                        did not testify that respondent had threatened anyone or presented any danger to others. In re J.C.D., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 828 S.E.2d 186, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 483 (2019).

                        Respondent’s involuntary commitment was erroneous as the findings of fact did not support the trial court’s conclusion that she was dangerous to herself because a physician’s testimony showed that, as of the hearing date, respondent was stabilized, medicated,
                        and not suffering from any acute symptoms; although she had been a danger to herself in the past, that history alone could not support a finding that she would be a danger to herself in the future; her four psychiatric stays within
                        the past two years and her schizophrenia did not support the conclusion she would be a danger to herself within the near future; and there was no evidence that her refusal to take her medication created a serious health risk in
                        the near future. In re N.U., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 840 S.E.2d 296, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 197 (2020).

                        In a case in which a trial court recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the findings under G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) regarding whether, without treatment,
                        his psychiatric condition would deteriorate and predictably result in dangerousness. The trial court’s written findings, coupled with the findings incorporated from a doctor’s report, were sufficient to support the trial court’s
                        determination that, based on the patient’s psychiatric history, he was in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness. In re Webber,

                        In a case in which a patient challenged a trial court’s order recommitting him to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s findings
                        that his condition would deteriorate and that he could likely become dangerous because, as the patient argued, his treating physician’s testimony regarding the patient’s history of violence and communication of threats was incompetent
                        evidence because it was based on hearsay. The physician testified as an expert witness, and it was appropriate for him to base an expert opinion on both his personal examination of the patient and other information included in
                        the patient’s official medical records, and G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) required the physician to rely on the patient’s psychiatric history. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d

                        Respondent was dangerous to himself where the evidence showed that he was unable without constant professional 24 hour supervision and medical treatment to satisfy his needs for personal or medical care, self-protection, and safety, he was grossly delusional,
                        paranoid, and manic, he was likely to suffer debilitation without treatment, his loss of touch with reality made it difficult for him to exercise judgment in the conduct of his daily affairs, and he was at risk of harm outside
                        the medical facility. Thus, there was a reasonable probability that he would suffer imminent harm absent commitment. In re B.S., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C.

                        Trial court did not err in entering an involuntary commitment order because it properly found that a patient was a danger to himself; the trial court’s finding the patient’s ACT team was unable to sufficiently care for his dental and nourishment needs
                        created the nexus between his mental illness and future harm to himself, and the trial court heard evidence of actions the patient was unable to control and of his severely impaired insight as to his own condition. In re C.G. (July

                        ideations toward his mother. In re Q.J., <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 358 (July 20, 2021).

                    The General Assembly finds that many consumers of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services are uncertain about their rights and responsibilities and how to access the public service system to obtain appropriate care and
                    treatment. The General Assembly recognizes the importance of ensuring that consumers have information about the availability of services and access to resources to obtain timely quality care. There is established the MH/DD/SA Consumer
                    Advocacy Program. The purpose of this Program is to provide consumers, their families, and providers with the information and advocacy needed to locate appropriate services, resolve complaints, or address common concerns and promote
                    community involvement. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department, within available resources and pursuant to its duties under this Chapter, ensure that the performance of the mental health care system in
                    this State is closely monitored, reviews are conducted, findings and recommendations and reports are made, and that local and systemic problems are identified and corrected when necessary to promote the rights and interests of all
                    consumers of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.

                        Session Laws 2013-360, s. 12D.2(a)-(e), provides: “(a) As used in this section, the term ‘group home’ means any facility that (i) is licensed under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                        of the General Statutes, (ii) meets the definition of a supervised living facility under 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(1) or 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(3), and (iii) serves adults whose primary diagnosis is mental illness or a developmental disability

                        this program in light of the fact that counties are required to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of this program. To that end, the General Assembly directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot

                        homes, in-home living arrangements, and assisted living residences as defined in G.S. 131D-2.1. The purposes of the pilot program are to (i) determine the best way to implement a block grant for this program statewide and (ii)
                        test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a tiered rate structure to address program participants’ intensity of need, including medication management. The Department shall select a minimum of four and a maximum of

                        operate for at least a 12-month period, and (iii) comply with any agreements in effect between the State of North Carolina and the United States government.

                        medication management.

                        in adult day care programs. The Secretary shall select a minimum of two, and a maximum of four, stable and successful certified adult day care programs in which to conduct the pilot. At least two of the programs selected shall
                        be operated by an organization that has been offering adult day care in North Carolina since 1980 and has received national recognition including all of the following criteria: designated as a National Model Adult Day Care Center
                        by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, designated as the only Teaching Day Center for recipients of North Carolina adult day care startup funds, received the North Carolina Non-Profit Center’s Non-Profit Sector Stewardship Award

                        respite program authorized under this act shall not exceed six beds. The State is not authorized to pay for any overnight respite services offered through this pilot, and the pilot shall not be eligible to enroll or otherwise participate

                        the health and safety of adult day care overnight respite participants. These requirements shall specify program management, staffing, building specifications, fire safety, sanitation, nutrition, enrollment, medication management,
                        and program activities. Participant assessments conducted by the adult day care pilot programs shall provide sufficient information to ensure appropriate care and to protect the health and safety of participants but shall not be
                        more onerous than current adult day care assessments. The Division of Health Service Regulation shall have the authority to enforce the rules adopted by the Department. Prior to the provision of overnight respite services, an adult
                        day care program participating in the pilot shall receive an initial inspection by the Division of Health Service Regulation for compliance with the rules. On a basis not less than every six months, the Division of Health Service
                        Regulation shall conduct monitoring visits and shall also be responsible for the investigation of complaints. Each adult day care program participating in the pilot shall periodically report the number of individuals served and
                        the average daily census to the Division of Health Service Regulation, on a schedule determined by the Division. The Division of Health Service Regulation shall have the authority to suspend admissions or terminate the pilot program

                        day care program participating in the pilot shall receive an initial inspection by the Division of Health Service Regulation for compliance with the rules. On a basis not less than every six months, the Division of Health Service

                    It is further the policy of this State that each client who is admitted to and is receiving services from a facility has the right to treatment, including access to medical care and habilitation, regardless of age or degree of mental illness, developmental
                    disabilities, or substance abuse. Each client has the right to an individualized written treatment or habilitation plan setting forth a program to maximize the development or restoration of his capabilities.

                        refused, the voluntarily admitted client may be discharged. In an emergency, a voluntarily admitted client may be administered treatment or medication, other than those specified in subsection (f) of this section, despite the refusal
                        of the client or the client’s legally responsible person, even if the client’s refusal is expressed in a valid advance instruction for mental health treatment. The Commission may adopt rules to provide a procedure to be followed

                        A minor client who is receiving treatment or habilitation from a 24-hour facility, as that term is defined in G.S. 122C-3(14)g, does not have the right to choose at his or her own expense or the expense of his or her legally responsible person, an attorney
                        of the minor client’s choice. The legally responsible person is the only one who can choose an attorney for the minor client unless the minor is over the age of 16 and emancipated. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt,
                        Sr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, — N.C.A.G. — (December 20, 1995).

                        Although a minor cannot obtain legal representation without the consent of the legally responsible person, the rights of the child can be adequately protected. First, the Department of Social Services can conduct an investigation of the legally responsible
                        person pursuant to G.S. 7A-542 et seq. (see now G.S. 7B-300 et seq.), the guardian ad litem program can provide additional support for abused, neglected, or dependent juveniles, including legal support and, a minor receives representation
                        for the commitment proceedings by virtue of G.S. 122C-224.1 and G.S. 122C-270. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt, Sr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, — N.C.A.G. — (December 20, 1995).

                        of the minor client’s choice. The legally responsible person is the only one who can choose an attorney for the minor client unless the minor is over the age of 16 and emancipated. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt,

                        Although a minor cannot obtain legal representation without the consent of the legally responsible person, the rights of the child can be adequately protected. First, the Department of Social Services can conduct an investigation of the legally responsible
                        person pursuant to G.S. 7A-542 et seq. (see now G.S. 7B-300 et seq.), the guardian ad litem program can provide additional support for abused, neglected, or dependent juveniles, including legal support and, a minor receives representation
                        for the commitment proceedings by virtue of G.S. 122C-224.1 and G.S. 122C-270. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt, Sr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, — N.C.A.G. — (December 20, 1995).

                    MAKING AN INSTRUCTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT This is an important legal document. It creates an instruction for mental health treatment. Before signing this document you should know these important facts: This document allows
                    you to make decisions in advance about certain types of mental health treatment. The instructions you include in this declaration will be followed if a physician or eligible psychologist determines that you are incapable of making
                    and communicating treatment decisions. Otherwise you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments. Your instructions may be overridden if you are being held in accordance with civil commitment law. Under
                    the Health Care Power of Attorney you may also appoint a person as your health care agent to make treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. You have the right to revoke this document at any time you have not been determined
                    to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS ADVANCE INSTRUCTION WHEN YOU ARE FOUND INCAPABLE BY A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER AUTHORIZED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician
                    or other provider. The physician or other provider shall note the revocation in your medical record. To be valid, this advance instruction must be signed by two qualified witnesses, personally known to you, who are present when you
                    sign or acknowledge your signature. It must also be acknowledged before a notary public. NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER Under North Carolina law, a person may use this advance instruction to provide consent
                    for future mental health treatment if the person later becomes incapable of making those decisions. Under the Health Care Power of Attorney the person may also appoint a health care agent to make mental health treatment decisions for
                    the person when incapable. A person is “incapable” when in the opinion of a physician or eligible psychologist the person currently lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make and communicate mental health treatment decisions.
                    This document becomes effective upon its proper execution and remains valid unless revoked. Upon being presented with this advance instruction, the physician or other provider must make it a part of the person’s medical record. The
                    attending physician or other mental health treatment provider must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance instruction when the person is determined to be incapable, unless compliance is not consistent with .
                    The physician or other mental health treatment provider shall promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the health care agent, and document noncompliance with any part of an advance instruction in the principal’s medical record.
                    The physician or other mental health treatment provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated, and notarized advance instruction, as provided in G.S. 122C-74(g) G.S. 122C-75

                        Requirement. —  An offer of employment by a provider licensed under this Chapter to an applicant to fill a position that does not require the applicant to have an occupational license is conditioned on consent to a State and national criminal history
                        record check of the applicant. If the applicant has been a resident of this State for less than five years, then the offer of employment is conditioned on consent to a State and national criminal history record check of the applicant.
                        The national criminal history record check shall include a check of the applicant’s fingerprints. If the applicant has been a resident of this State for five years or more, then the offer is conditioned on consent to a State criminal
                        history record check of the applicant. A provider shall not employ an applicant who refuses to consent to a criminal history record check required by this section. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, within five business
                        days of making the conditional offer of employment, a provider shall submit a request to the Department of Public Safety under G.S. 143B-939 to conduct a criminal history record check required by this section or shall submit a
                        request to a private entity to conduct a State criminal history record check required by this section. Notwithstanding G.S. 143B-939, the Department of Public Safety shall return the results of national criminal history record
                        checks for employment positions not covered by Public Law 105-277 to the Department of Health and Human Services, Criminal Records Check Unit. Within five business days of receipt of the national criminal history of the person,
                        the Department of Health and Human Services, Criminal Records Check Unit, shall notify the provider as to whether the information received may affect the employability of the applicant. In no case shall the results of the national
                        criminal history record check be shared with the provider. Providers shall make available upon request verification that a criminal history check has been completed on any staff covered by this section. A county that has adopted
                        an appropriate local ordinance and has access to the Department of Public Safety data bank may conduct on behalf of a provider a State criminal history record check required by this section without the provider having to submit
                        a request to the Department of Justice. In such a case, the county shall commence with the State criminal history record check required by this section within five business days of the conditional offer of employment by the provider.
                        All criminal history information received by the provider is confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the applicant as provided in subsection (c) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, the term “private entity”
                        means a business regularly engaged in conducting criminal history record checks utilizing public records obtained from a State agency.

                    federal funds that are paid for services that are found to be unnecessary or otherwise ineligible for payment, the Department shall implement on a temporary basis a community support provider appeals process. The process shall be a
                    substitute for informal provider appeals at the Department level and formal provider appeals by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The community support provider appeals process shall apply to a community support services provider:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) Who is aggrieved by a decision of the Department to reduce, deny, recoup, or recover reimbursement for community support services, or to deny, suspend, or revoke a provider agreement to provide community support services.

                    identify the petitioner, be signed by the party or representative of the party, and shall describe the agency action giving rise to the contested case. As used in this section, ‘file or filing’ means to place the paper or item to be
                    filed into the care and custody of the chief hearings clerk of the Department and acceptance thereof by the chief hearings clerk, except that the hearing officer may permit the papers to be filed with the hearing officer, in which
                    event the hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date. The Department shall supply forms for use in these contested cases.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>

                    who will make the final decision. If neither written arguments are presented, nor extension of time granted by the final agency decision maker for good cause, within 15 days of the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision,
                    the proposal for decision becomes final. If written arguments are presented, such arguments shall be considered and the final decision shall be rendered. The final decision shall be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of
                    the filing of the petition. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by final agency decision maker, for good cause shown. The final decision shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner’s representative
                    by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency. In the absence of a petition for judicial review filed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the final decision shall be binding upon the petitioner and the Department.

                    “(7) In the event of a conflict between federal law or regulations and State law or regulations, federal law or regulations shall control. This section applies to all petitions that are filed by a Medicaid community support services provider on or after
                    July 1, 2008, and for all Medicaid community support services provider petitions that have been filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings previous to July 1, 2008, but for which a hearing on the merits has not been commenced prior
                    to that date. The requirement that the agency decision must be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition for hearing shall not apply to (i) community support services provider petitions that were filed
                    at the Office of Administrative Hearings or (ii) requests for a hearing under the Department’s informal settlement process prior to the effective date of this act. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall transfer all cases affected
                    by this section to the Department of Health and Human Services within 30 days of the effective date of this section. This act preempts the existing informal appeal process and reconsideration review process at the Department of Health
                    and Human Services and the existing appeal process at the Office of Administrative Hearings with regard to all appeals filed by Medicaid community support services providers under the Medical Assistance program.

                <p>
                    “(e3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Department of Health and Human Services may, pursuant to its statutory authority or federal Medicaid requirements, suspend the endorsement or Medicaid participation of a provider of
                    community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider’s appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose
                    endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final
                    agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department
                    or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal
                    is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.

                    “(b) The Department shall conduct an evaluation of the capitated 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid waiver demonstration program sites to determine the programs’ impact on consumers with developmental disabilities. The evaluation shall include a satisfaction survey
                    of consumers. The Department shall consider the impact on ICF/MR facilities included in the waiver to determine and, to the extent possible, minimize potential inconsistencies with the DMA-ICF/MR rate plan and the requirements of G.S.
                    131E-176 and G.S. 131E-178 without negatively impacting the viability and success of the waiver program. The Department shall consult with stakeholders and evaluate all other waiver options, including the possibility of a waiver without

                    of services for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion
                    of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion authorized in this

                    federal funds that are paid for services that are found to be unnecessary or otherwise ineligible for payment, the Department shall implement on a temporary basis a community support provider appeals process. The process shall be a
                    substitute for informal provider appeals at the Department level and formal provider appeals by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The community support provider appeals process shall apply to a community support services provider:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) Who is aggrieved by a decision of the Department to reduce, deny, recoup, or recover reimbursement for community support services, or to deny, suspend, or revoke a provider agreement to provide community support services.

                <p>
                    “(2) Whose endorsement has been withdrawn or whose application for endorsement has been denied by a local management entity.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) A hearing under this section shall be commenced by filing a petition with the chief hearings clerk of the Department within 30 days of the mailing of the notice by the Department of the action giving rise to the contested case. The petition shall
                    identify the petitioner, be signed by the party or representative of the party, and shall describe the agency action giving rise to the contested case. As used in this section, ‘file or filing’ means to place the paper or item to be
                    filed into the care and custody of the chief hearings clerk of the Department and acceptance thereof by the chief hearings clerk, except that the hearing officer may permit the papers to be filed with the hearing officer, in which
                    event the hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date. The Department shall supply forms for use in these contested cases.

                    ensure that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “a. Notice of the hearing is given not less than 15 days before the hearing. The notice shall state the date, hour, and place of the hearing and shall be deemed to have been given on the date that a copy of the notice is mailed, via certified mail, to
                    the address provided by the petitioner in the petition for hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “b. The hearing is held in Wake County, except that the hearing officer may, take testimony and receive evidence by telephone or other electronic means. The petitioner and the petitioner’s legal representative may appear before the hearing officer in

                    No later than five days before the date of the hearing, each party to a contested case shall identify each witness that the party intends to call.

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>

                <p>

                    180 days after the final decision is mailed as provided in G.S. 108A-79(i)(5).
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) The hearing officer shall decide the case based upon a preponderance of the evidence, giving deference to the demonstrated knowledge and expertise of the agency as provided in G.S. 150B-34(a). The hearing officer shall prepare a proposal for the
                    decision, citing relevant law, regulations, and evidence, which shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner’s representative by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) The petitioner and the respondent agency shall have 15 days from the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision to present written arguments in opposition to or in support of the proposal for decision to the designated official of the Department
                    who will make the final decision. If neither written arguments are presented, nor extension of time granted by the final agency decision maker for good cause, within 15 days of the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision,
                    the proposal for decision becomes final. If written arguments are presented, such arguments shall be considered and the final decision shall be rendered. The final decision shall be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of
                    the filing of the petition. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by final agency decision maker, for good cause shown. The final decision shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner’s representative
                    by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency. In the absence of a petition for judicial review filed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the final decision shall be binding upon the petitioner and the Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(6) A petitioner who is dissatisfied with the final decision of the Department may file, within 30 days of the service of the decision, a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court of Wake County or of the county from which the case arose. The
                    judicial review shall be conducted according to Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(7) In the event of a conflict between federal law or regulations and State law or regulations, federal law or regulations shall control. This section applies to all petitions that are filed by a Medicaid community support services provider on or after
                    July 1, 2008, and for all Medicaid community support services provider petitions that have been filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings previous to July 1, 2008, but for which a hearing on the merits has not been commenced prior
                    to that date. The requirement that the agency decision must be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition for hearing shall not apply to (i) community support services provider petitions that were filed
                    at the Office of Administrative Hearings or (ii) requests for a hearing under the Department’s informal settlement process prior to the effective date of this act. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall transfer all cases affected
                    by this section to the Department of Health and Human Services within 30 days of the effective date of this section. This act preempts the existing informal appeal process and reconsideration review process at the Department of Health
                    and Human Services and the existing appeal process at the Office of Administrative Hearings with regard to all appeals filed by Medicaid community support services providers under the Medical Assistance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(e3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Department of Health and Human Services may, pursuant to its statutory authority or federal Medicaid requirements, suspend the endorsement or Medicaid participation of a provider of
                    community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider’s appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose
                    endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final
                    agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department
                    or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal
                    is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(e4) The Department’s community support provider appeals process established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010. The Department shall report to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate
                    Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, and the Fiscal Research Division on March 1, 2009, October

                    upon approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
                </p>

                    “(b) The Department shall conduct an evaluation of the capitated 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid waiver demonstration program sites to determine the programs’ impact on consumers with developmental disabilities. The evaluation shall include a satisfaction survey
                    of consumers. The Department shall consider the impact on ICF/MR facilities included in the waiver to determine and, to the extent possible, minimize potential inconsistencies with the DMA-ICF/MR rate plan and the requirements of G.S.
                    131E-176 and G.S. 131E-178 without negatively impacting the viability and success of the waiver program. The Department shall consult with stakeholders and evaluate all other waiver options, including the possibility of a waiver without

                    Session Laws 2011-264, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2012-151, s. 13(a) and (b), provides: “(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) shall proceed with statewide restructuring of the management responsibilities for the delivery
                    of services for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion
                    of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion authorized in this

                    services determined to be medically necessary and at the appropriate funding level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) As the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver expands statewide, phase out the current CAP-MR/DD Waiver as well as the utilization management functions currently performed by public and private contractors.

                <p>
                    At any time that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines that an area authority is in imminent danger of failing financially and of failing to provide direct services to clients, the Secretary, after providing written notification
                    of the Secretary’s intent to the area board and after providing the area authority an opportunity to be heard, may assume control of the financial affairs of the area authority and appoint an administrator to exercise the powers assumed.
                    This assumption of control shall have the effect of divesting the area authority of its powers as to the adoption of budgets, expenditures of money, and all other financial powers conferred in the area authority by law. County funding
                    of the area authority shall continue when the State has assumed control of the financial affairs of the area authority. At no time after the State has assumed this control shall a county withdraw funds previously obligated or appropriated
                    to the area authority. The Secretary shall adopt rules to define imminent danger of failing financially and of failing to provide direct services to clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon assumption of financial control, the Department shall, in conjunction with the area authority, develop and implement a corrective plan of action and provide notification to the area authority’s board of directors of the plan. The Department shall
                    also keep the county board of commissioners and the area authority’s board of directors informed of any ongoing concerns or problems with the area authority’s finances.

                    Session Laws 2018-5, s. 11F.10(a), provides: “(a) The General Assembly finds that a viable State-funded behavioral health system is critical to accomplishing the State’s goals for behavioral health, meeting the needs of the covered populations, and achieving
                    the desired outcomes detailed in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Strategic Plan for Improvement of Behavioral Health Services. Integral to assessing the State’s behavioral health system is the development of a method to
                    determine the viability of local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) and the establishment of short-term and intermediate term solvency standards that provide a uniform analysis of each LME/MCO’s financial position,
                    provide a mechanism for ongoing assessment of each LME/MCO’s viability, inform the State’s funding decisions, and enhance short-term and intermediate term planning by the LME/MCOs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2018-5, s. 11F.10(c), provides: “(c) At the next renewal or amendment of a contract with a local management entity an- aged care organization (LME/MCO), the De- partment of Health and Human Services shall explicitly require, as part of that
                    contract, the LME/MCO to comply with G.S. 122C-125.2, as enacted by subsection (b) of this section.”

                    Session Laws 2018-5, s. 1.1, provides: “This act shall be known as the ‘Current Operations Appropriations Act of 2018.’ ”

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2018-5, s. 39.4, provides: “Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 2018-2019 fiscal year, the textual provisions of this act apply only to funds appropriated for, and
                    activities occurring during, the 2018-2019 fiscal year.”

                        For the purposes of this section, competitive health care information means information relating to competitive health care activities by or on behalf of the area authority. Competitive health care information shall be confidential and not a public record
                        under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes; provided that any contract entered into by or on behalf of an area authority shall be a public record, unless otherwise exempted by law, or the contract contains competitive health care

                        competitive health care information prior to disclosure or, if the entire contract constitutes competitive health care information, refuse disclosure of the contract. The person requesting disclosure of the contract may institute
                        an action pursuant to G.S. 132-9 to compel disclosure of the contract or any redacted portion thereof. In any action brought under this subsection, the issue for decision by the court shall be whether the contract, or portions
                        of the contract withheld, constitutes competitive health care information, and in making its determination, the court shall be guided by the procedures and standards applicable to protective orders requested under Rule 26(c)(7)
                        of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Before rendering a decision, the court shall review the contract in camera and hear arguments from the parties. If the court finds that the contract constitutes or contains competitive health care
                        information, the court may either deny disclosure or may make such other appropriate orders as are permitted under Rule 26(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

                        at the place determined in accordance with the rules adopted by the Secretary. A hearing before the Panel shall be informal; no sworn testimony shall be taken and the rules of evidence do not apply. The person that appeals to the

                        or county program. If a party to an appeal fails to comply with a decision of the Panel and the Secretary determines that the failure deprives clients of the area authority or county program of a type of needed service, the Secretary

                    and federal funds that are paid for services that are found to be unnecessary or otherwise ineligible for payment, the Department shall implement on a temporary basis a community support provider appeals process. The process shall
                    be a substitute for informal provider appeals at the Department level and formal provider appeals by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The community support provider appeals process shall apply to a community support services

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(2) Whose endorsement has been withdrawn or whose application for endorsement has been denied by a local management entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(e2) The community support provider appeals process shall be developed and implemented as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) A hearing under this section shall be commenced by filing a petition with the chief hearings clerk of the Department within 30 days of the mailing of the notice by the Department of the action giving rise to the contested case. The petition shall
                    identify the petitioner, be signed by the party or representative of the party, and shall describe the agency action giving rise to the contested case. As used in this section, ‘file or filing’ means to place the paper or item to be
                    filed into the care and custody of the chief hearings clerk of the Department and acceptance thereof by the chief hearings clerk, except that the hearing officer may permit the papers to be filed with the hearing officer, in which

                <p>
                    “(2) If there is a timely request for an appeal, the Department shall promptly designate a hearing officer who shall hold an evidentiary hearing. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing according to applicable federal law and regulations and shall
                    ensure that:

                    the address provided by the petitioner in the petition for hearing.

                    Wake County.

                    No later than five days before the date of the hearing, each party to a contested case shall identify each witness that the party intends to call.

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    “d. The appeal hearing shall be recorded. If a petition for judicial review is filed the Department shall include a copy of the recording of the hearing as part of the official record. The recording of the appeal hearing may be erased or otherwise destroyed
                    180 days after the final decision is mailed as provided in G.S. 108A-79(i)(5).

                <p>
                    “(4) The hearing officer shall decide the case based upon a preponderance of the evidence, giving deference to the demonstrated knowledge and expertise of the agency as provided in G.S. 150B-34(a). The hearing officer shall prepare a proposal for the
                    decision, citing relevant law, regulations, and evidence, which shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner’s representative by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) The petitioner and the respondent agency shall have 15 days from the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision to present written arguments in opposition to or in support of the proposal for decision to the designated official of the Department
                    who will make the final decision. If neither written arguments are presented, nor extension of time granted by the final agency decision maker for good cause, within 15 days of the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision,
                    the proposal for decision becomes final. If written arguments are presented, such arguments shall be considered and the final decision shall be rendered. The final decision shall be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of
                    the filing of the petition. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by final agency decision maker, for good cause shown. The final decision shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner’s representative
                    by certified mail, with a copy furnished to the respondent agency. In the absence of a petition for judicial review filed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the final decision shall be binding upon the petitioner and the Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(6) A petitioner who is dissatisfied with the final decision of the Department may file, within 30 days of the service of the decision, a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court of Wake County or of the county from which the case arose. The
                    judicial review shall be conducted according to Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(7) In the event of a conflict between federal law or regulations and State law or regulations, federal law or regulations shall control. This section applies to all petitions that are filed by a Medicaid community support services provider on or after
                    July 1, 2008, and for all Medicaid community support services provider petitions that have been filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings previous to July 1, 2008, but for which a hearing on the merits has not been commenced prior
                    to that date. The requirement that the agency decision must be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition for hearing shall not apply to (i) community support services provider petitions that were filed
                    at the Office of Administrative Hearings or (ii) requests for a hearing under the Department’s informal settlement process prior to the effective date of this act. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall transfer all cases affected
                    by this section to the Department of Health and Human Services within 30 days of the effective date of this section. This act preempts the existing informal appeal process and reconsideration review process at the Department of Health
                    and Human Services and the existing appeal process at the Office of Administrative Hearings with regard to all appeals filed by Medicaid community support services providers under the Medical Assistance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(e3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Department of Health and Human Services may, pursuant to its statutory authority or federal Medicaid requirements, suspend the endorsement or Medicaid participation of a provider of
                    community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider’s appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose
                    endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final
                    agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department
                    or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal
                    is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(e4) The Department’s community support provider appeals process established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010. The Department shall report to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate
                    Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, and the Fiscal Research Division on March 1, 2009, October
                    1, 2009, and March 1, 2010, on the effectiveness and efficiency of the community support provider appeals process.”

                    all the powers of police officers of cities. The Secretary, or the Secretary’s designee, may assign these special police officers to other State-operated facilities on a temporary basis to carry out the powers allowed under this section
                    and as otherwise provided by laws relating to the specific joint security force to which they are assigned. Upon this temporary assignment, the special police officer will take the oath in G.S. 122C-184 for that specific facility.
                    Following the oath, the police officer has the right to arrest without warrant individuals committing violations of the State law or the ordinances or rules of that facility in their presence and to bring the offenders before a magistrate
                    who shall proceed as in other criminal cases.

                    It is State policy to encourage voluntary admissions to facilities. It is further State policy that no individual shall be involuntarily committed to a 24-hour facility unless that individual is mentally ill or a substance abuser and dangerous to self
                    or others. All admissions and commitments shall be accomplished under conditions that protect the dignity and constitutional rights of the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is further State policy that, except as provided in G.S. 122C-212(b), individuals who have been voluntarily admitted shall be discharged upon application and that involuntarily committed individuals shall be discharged as soon as a less restrictive
                    mode of treatment is appropriate.

        Purpose of Involuntary Commitment Proceeding. —

                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of an involuntary commitment proceeding is to protect the person who, after due process, has been found to be both mentally ill and imminently dangerous, by placing such a person in more protected environment where the danger may be
                        minimized and his treatment facilitated; in a real sense the proceeding is an important step in his medical and psychiatric treatment. In re Farrow, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 680, 255 S.E.2d
                        777, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2728 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Two purposes for the involuntary commitment statute are (1) to allow temporary withdrawal from society of those who may be dangerous and (2) to provide treatment. In re Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 295
                        S.E.2d 604, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2855 (1982).

                        An involuntary commitment proceeding is a proceeding of a civil nature which is governed by pertinent Rules of Civil Procedure. In re Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C.

                        To enter a commitment order, the trial court is required to ultimately find two distinct facts, i.e., that the respondent is mentally ill and is dangerous to himself or to others. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite>                        243, 271 S.E.2d 72, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3374 (1980).

                    <p>
                        By requiring that the person be found dangerous to himself or others, the legislature has made it clear that involuntary commitment is not for all those who are mentally ill, or even for those whose mental illness may make it necessary for them to have
                        custodial care. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2136 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Where doctor testified only that the respondent was unable to care for herself and that she was a complete nursing care problem, and there was no showing that the respondent was dangerous to herself, the requirements for involuntary commitment were not
                        met. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2136 (1978).

                        Adopting the standard enunciated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982), the court held that so long as the requisite procedures were followed, and the decision to restrain plaintiff, a voluntarily admitted patient
                        at a State mental hospital, was an exercise of professional judgment, the defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for their actions. Alt v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 307, 435

                        The statutory immunity given by this section makes it most unlikely that the North Carolina Supreme Court would hold that North Carolina’s public policy and its tort law would impose tort liabilities upon psychiatrists at Veterans Administration hospital

                        Absent allegation of gross or intentional negligence, plaintiffs’ claims of negligence on part of health care providers at Veteran’s Administration facility were precluded by statutory immunity. Cantrell v. United States, 735 F. Supp. 670, 1988 U.S. Dist.

                        Because there was a question of fact as to whether defendant rehabilitation center and its chief operating officer followed the applicable standard of care, they were not entitled to qualified immunity under G.S. 122C-210.1 on plaintiff’s wrongful death
                        claims as a matter of law; plaintiff alleged facts that defendants had violated accepted professional judgment, practice and standards, an investigative report from the North Carolina Division of Facility Services found that the
                        facility had failed to adequately supervise plaintiff’s brother, and plaintiff’s complaint was certified by an expert under N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) that the medical care outlined in the complaint did not comply with the applicable

                        interest in being able to seek immediate treatment and the policy of encouraging voluntary admissions, would outweigh any interest the minor might have in a pre-admission hearing. However, the continued confinement of a minor based
                        on that procedure would require procedural safeguards consistent with the due process clause. Such procedural due process should be afforded at the earliest possible time after admission. In re Long, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C.

       Following Admission of Minor Child to Treatment Facility Only
    Court or Facility May Release Minor.
      </b> Pursuant to the provisions of former G.S. 122-56.7, parents who applied for admission of their minor child to a treatment facility could not later obtain a discharge of the child prior to judicial determination of the need
                    for further treatment at the treatment facility. Only the court or the treatment facility could release the minor child and only then upon determination that the child did not need further hospitalization. See opinion of Attorney General
                    to Mary B. Chamblee, Assistant Public Defender, 26th Judicial District, 49 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 166 (1980).

                    Although a minor cannot obtain legal representation without the consent of the legally responsible person, the rights of the child can be adequately protected. First, the Department of Social Services can conduct an investigation of the legally responsible
                    person pursuant to G.S. 7A-542 et seq. [see now G.S. 7B-300 et seq.], the guardian ad litem program can provide additional support for abused, neglected, or dependent juveniles, including legal support and, a minor receives representation
                    for the commitment proceedings by virtue of this section and G.S. 122C-270. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt, Sr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, — N.C.A.G. — (December 20, 1995).

                        Because of the State’s great interest in preventing unwarranted admission of juveniles into twenty-four hour psychiatric treatment facilities, appeal from orders of voluntary admission of a minor to such a facility falls into the public policy exception

                        Trial court erred in continuing a minor’s admission at a psychiatric treatment facility because it failed to make a specific finding that the minor was in need of further treatment at the facility; though need for further treatment is a reasonable inference
                        of the findings and conclusions made, the required ultimate findings of fact must be made explicitly. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        adult is mentally ill or a substance abuser and is in need of further treatment at the facility. Further treatment at the facility should be undertaken only when lesser measures will be insufficient. If the court finds by clear,
                        cogent, and convincing evidence that these requirements have been met, the court shall concur with the voluntary admission of the incompetent adult and set the length of the authorized admission for a period not to exceed 90 days.

                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.

                        At common law there was a right to detain a mentally ill person in order to protect such person from self-injury and the public from injury at the hands of such deranged person. This doubtless accounts for the action of the legislature in authorizing
                        such an emergency commitment. The action of the legislature supplanted the common-law rule. Samons v. Meymandi, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C.

                        Right to trial by jury did not exist at common law in insanity proceedings and was thus not required under former G.S. 122-58.3. In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C.

                        A commitment order is essentially a judgment by which a person is deprived of his liberty, and as a result, he is entitled to the safeguard of a determination by a neutral officer of the court that reasonable grounds exist for his original detention,
                        just as he would be if he were to be deprived of liberty in a criminal context. In re Reed, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 249 S.E.2d 864, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS

                        When a respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding is delivered to a hospital for an initial examination to recommend whether commitment is required, neither the examiner nor the hospital obtains custody or a legal right to control the respondent
                        unless and until involuntary commitment is recommended; neither the examiner nor the facility owes a duty to third parties for harm resulting from an examiner’s recommendation, even if the examination failed to comply with statutory

                        While it is the finding by the physician that directly results in the restraint of the respondent, the examiner at a first examination is empowered only to make certain findings, and it is only after specific findings are made that control is exercised.
                        McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 669 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Examiner has no discretion whether or not to release a respondent, but it is the statutes that dictate the result on the basis of the examiner’s findings, and the examiner is not authorized by law to deviate from those statutorily-imposed results; nor
                        may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself. McArdle v.

                        Complainant waived any challenge to the sufficiency of the affidavit to support a magistrate’s original custody order because the complainant failed to raise the issue of the sufficiency of the affidavit during the first involuntary commitment hearing

                        Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family’s negligence complaint because the nature of the duty imposed, in light of the particulars of the statutory scheme, was insufficient to impose a “special relationship” between healthcare
                        providers and the patient; the healthcare providers had no right to control the patient at the time of the alleged breach of duty to him because it occurred prior to his admission to their care. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc.,

                        In a case in which a trial court’s order recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, while he used the phrase subject matter jurisdiction,
                        he was actually arguing that the trial court did not have authority to order an 180-day commitment under G.S. 122C-271(b). There was no dispute that the trial court had authority to adjudicate the issues in dispute and had jurisdiction
                        over the parties, as a result, the trial court’s May 21, 2007 order was not void, even if contrary to law; the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the civil commitment proceedings when the petition and affidavit were filed pursuant

                        Where a decedent was tased when officers executed an involuntary commitment order on the decedent, the officers used unreasonably excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment because, inter alia, immediately tasing a non-criminal, mentally ill
                        individual, who seconds before had been conversational, was not a proportional response; however, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity as to the excessive force claim because the decedent’s right not to be tased while

                        While it is the finding by the physician that directly results in the restraint of the respondent, the examiner at a first examination is empowered only to make certain findings, and it is only after specific findings are made that control is exercised.

                        Examiner has no discretion whether or not to release a respondent, but it is the statutes that dictate the result on the basis of the examiner’s findings, and the examiner is not authorized by law to deviate from those statutorily-imposed results; nor
                        may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself. McArdle v.

                        Where police had been called to plaintiff’s apartment in relation to a “hostage situation”, plaintiff’s journal notes referenced killing himself and others, and plaintiff refused to come out of his house, police had probable cause under this section to

                        Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family’s negligence complaint because the nature of the duty imposed, in light of the particulars of the statutory scheme, was insufficient to impose a “special relationship” between healthcare
                        providers and the patient; the healthcare providers had no right to control the patient at the time of the alleged breach of duty to him because it occurred prior to his admission to their care. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc.,

                                show on the examination report. If, in addition to mental illness and dangerousness, the commitment examiner also finds that the respondent is known or reasonably believed to have an intellectual disability, this finding
                                shall be shown on the report. Upon notification, the law enforcement officer or other designated person shall take the respondent to a 24-hour facility described in G.S. 122C-252 pending a district court hearing. To the
                                extent feasible, in providing the transportation of the respondent, the law enforcement officer shall act within six hours of notification. The other designated person shall take the respondent to a 24-hour facility described
                                in G.S. 122C-252 pending a district court hearing within six hours of notification. If there is no area 24-hour facility and if the respondent is indigent and unable to pay for care at a private 24-hour facility, the law
                                enforcement officer or other designated person shall take the respondent to a State facility for individuals with mental illnesses designated by the Commission in accordance with G.S. 143B-147(a)(1)a. for custody, observation,
                                and treatment and immediately notify the clerk of superior court of this action. If a 24-hour facility is not immediately available or appropriate to the respondent’s medical condition, the respondent may be temporarily
                                detained under appropriate supervision at the site of the first examination. Upon the commitment examiner’s determination that a 24-hour facility is available and medically appropriate, the law enforcement officer or other
                                designated person shall transport the respondent after receiving a request for transportation by the facility of the commitment examiner. To the extent feasible, in providing the transportation of the respondent, the law
                                enforcement officer shall act within six hours of notification. The other designated person shall transport the respondent without unnecessary delay and within six hours after receiving a request for transportation by the
                                facility of the commitment examiner. At any time during the respondent’s temporary detention under appropriate supervision, if a commitment examiner determines that the respondent is no longer in need of inpatient commitment,
                                the proceedings shall be terminated and the respondent transported and released in accordance with subdivision (3) of this subsection. However, if the commitment examiner determines that the respondent meets the criteria
                                for outpatient commitment, as defined in subdivision (1) of this subsection, the commitment examiner may recommend outpatient commitment, and the respondent shall be transported and released in accordance with subdivision
                                (1) of this subsection. Any decision to terminate the proceedings or to recommend outpatient commitment after an initial recommendation of inpatient commitment shall be documented and reported to the clerk of superior court
                                in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. If the respondent is temporarily detained and a 24-hour facility is not available or medically appropriate seven days after the issuance of the custody order, a commitment
                                examiner shall report this fact to the clerk of superior court and the proceedings shall be terminated. Termination of proceedings pursuant to this subdivision shall not prohibit or prevent the initiation of new involuntary
                                commitment proceedings when appropriate. A commitment examiner may initiate a new involuntary commitment proceeding prior to the expiration of this seven-day period, as long as the respondent continues to meet applicable
                                criteria. Affidavits filed in support of proceedings terminated pursuant to this subdivision shall not be submitted in support of any subsequent petitions for involuntary commitment. If the affiant initiating new commitment
                                proceedings is a commitment examiner, the affiant shall conduct a new examination and shall not rely upon examinations conducted as part of proceedings terminated pursuant to this subdivision.In the event an individual

                    the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substances Abuse Services by October 1, 2009. The report shall include data gathered from all participating LMEs since the

                    “(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.
                </p>

                    The North Carolina Nurses Association, National Association of Social Workers, The North Carolina Substance Abuse Professional Practice Board, North Carolina Psychological Association, The North Carolina Society for Clinical Social

                        Involuntary commitment statutes, including G.S. 122C-263 are designed to protect against arbitrary or ill-considered involuntary commitment and, although there may be some “generalized safety implications” in those statutes, they are not considered public
                        safety statutes as defined by the North Carolina Supreme Court; therefore, any violation thereof cannot be considered negligence per se. Gregory v. Kilbride, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 601,

                        In a case in which a patient challenged a trial court’s order recommitting him to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s findings
                        that his condition would deteriorate and that he could likely become dangerous because, as the patient argued, his treating physician’s testimony regarding the patient’s history of violence and communication of threats was incompetent
                        evidence because it was based on hearsay. The physician testified as an expert witness, and it was appropriate for him to base an expert opinion on both his personal examination of the patient and other information included in
                        the patient’s official medical records, and G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) required the physician to rely on the patient’s psychiatric history. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d

                        may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself. McArdle v.

                        Following a first examination, custody continues with law enforcement until the respondent is transferred to a 24-hour facility for the custody and treatment of involuntary clients, or, in cases where commitment is not recommended, returned to a residence
                        and released from custody; the legislature has not seen fit to confer custody of an involuntary commitment respondent on anyone other than law enforcement or other person properly designated prior to and during a first examination.

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 122-58.5 stated that at the minimum the notice should be served 48 hours in advance of the hearing. This time period was constitutionally adequate to allow for sufficient preparation, especially in light of the fact that continuances could
                        be granted, which would prevent any prejudice because of insufficient time to prepare. French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16603 (M.D.N.C. 1977), aff'd, 443 U.S. 901, 99 S. Ct. 3091, 61 L. Ed. 2d 869,
                        1979 U.S. LEXIS 2401 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 122-58.5 used the terms “notify” and “notice.” There could be little doubt that these terms were used to carry the full panoply of due process notice mandated by the law of the land. When the legislature uses the term “notice” it means such
                        notice as is required by due process and, therefore, former G.S. 122-58.5 was constitutional on its face. French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16603 (M.D.N.C. 1977), aff'd, 443 U.S. 901, 99 S. Ct. 3091,
                        61 L. Ed. 2d 869, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 2401 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In light of the nature of the proceedings, the procedure in former G.S. 122-58.5 was reasonably calculated to inform the respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding of the nature and purpose of the hearing and, therefore, was not constitutionally
                        infirm. There is no constitutional mandate to notify the respondent of the burden of proof or to serve upon him a list of witnesses and the substance of their proposed testimony. Such is not even required in a criminal proceeding.

                        Because the plain language of the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-264(d1), requires that notice of G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 hearings be given to anyone who has requested notice of a hearing
                        concerning discharge or conditional release, the statute recognizes that hearings under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 are hearings that may involve a conditional release; construing G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S.
                        122C-277 in pari materia, it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent’s
                        treating physician or whether it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate
                        authority under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release in an automatically calendared proceeding. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395,

                        Because a patient did not raise the issue of a violation of subsection (a) before the district court, she failed to preserve the issue for appellate review; the court of appeals improperly vacated the patient’s involuntary commitment order because it
                        erred in holding that subsection (a) imposed a statutory mandate that automatically preserves a violation of that provision for appellate review. In re E.D., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 111</cite>, 827

                        Where the record showed that examining physician’s affidavit formed the basis of order of commitment, and respondent was not afforded the right, guaranteed by statute, to cross-examine the physician, the evidence was not sufficient to support the findings

                        his psychiatric condition would deteriorate and predictably result in dangerousness. The trial court’s written findings, coupled with the findings incorporated from a doctor’s report, were sufficient to support the trial court’s

                        The involuntary commitment statutes do not require that an order of commitment may issue only when the requisite factual findings are supported by competent medical evidence. All that is required is that the court make the essential findings from “clear,

                        On appeal from an order of commitment, the questions for determination in the Court of Appeals become (1) whether the court’s ultimate findings are indeed supported by the “facts” which the court recorded in its order as supporting its findings, and (2)
                        whether in any event there was competent evidence to support the court’s findings. In re Hogan, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 232 S.E.2d 492, <cite class="nc_code">1977 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1965 (1977).

                        Trial court must find three elements present in order to find that respondent is dangerous to others: (1) within the recent past (2) respondent has (a) inflicted serious bodily harm on another, or (b) attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another,
                        or (c) threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or (d) has acted in such a manner as to create a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, and (3) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will

                        Respondent was dangerous to himself where the evidence showed that he was unable without constant professional 24 hour supervision and medical treatment to satisfy his needs for personal or medical care, self-protection, and safety, he was grossly delusional,
                        paranoid, and manic, he was likely to suffer debilitation without treatment, his loss of touch with reality made it difficult for him to exercise judgment in the conduct of his daily affairs, and he was at risk of harm outside

                        physician’s report, incorporated by the order, that the patient was a 56-year-old white male, with a history of alcohol abuse/dependence, admitted with manic episode, and who continued to be symptomatic with limited insight regarding

                        the involuntary commitment because (1) the trial court’s findings reflected the individual’s mental illness, but they did not indicate that the individual’s illness or any of the individual’s symptoms would persist and endanger
                        the individual within the near future pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(a)(1); and (2) the trial court’s findings were insufficient to support its conclusion that the individual was dangerous to others pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(b).

                        created a serious health risk in the near future, an expert’s only testimony concerning the respondent’s “nourishment” was that he lost some “unknown amount” of weight, but that his current weight was safe, and the respondent’s

                        and not suffering from any acute symptoms; although she had been a danger to herself in the past, that history alone could not support a finding that she would be a danger to herself in the future; her four psychiatric stays within

                        Trial court has authority to order a conditional release under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-277, because the pain language in G.S. 122C-277 indicates that the General Assembly intended conditional
                        release as a dispositional option in the insanity acquittee involuntary commitment context; construing the Act, G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia, it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing
                        the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent’s treating physician or whether it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory
                        mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release
                        in an automatically calendared proceeding. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in recommitting a respondent who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity to involuntary inpatient treatment because the trial court, which was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, made its
                        findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law, and since the trial court did not make findings of fact that there was a reasonable probability that respondent’s seriously violent conduct would be repeated
                        and that he would be dangerous to others in the future in the absence of an unconditional release, the court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would
                        still have recommitted respondent; a trial court has authority following a hearing under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional
                        release of an insanity acquittee. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                    Although a minor cannot obtain legal representation without the consent of the legally responsible person, the rights of the child can be adequately protected. First, the Department of Social Services can conduct an investigation of the legally responsible
                    person pursuant to G.S. 7A-542 et seq. (see now G.S. 7B-300 et seq.), the guardian ad litem program can provide additional support for abused, neglected, or dependent juveniles, including legal support and, a minor can receive representation
                    for the commitment proceedings by virtue of G.S. 122C-224.1 and this section. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Robin Britt, Sr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, — N.C.A.G. — (December 20, 1995).

                        By requiring that the person be found dangerous to herself or others, the legislature has made it clear that involuntary commitment is not for all those who are mentally ill, or even for those whose mental illness may make it necessary for them to have
                        custodial care. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2136 (1978) (decided under former statutory provisions).

                        not met. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2136 (1978) (decided under former statutory provisions).

                        In a case in which a trial court issued an order recommitting a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because his initial commitment order in 2007 provided
                        for a term of outpatient commitment that exceeded the period authorized by the governing statute, and the initial commitment period expired as a matter of law, the patient’s appeal was an improper collateral attack on the 2007
                        commitment order. It was undisputed on appeal that the trial court’s May 21, 2007 commitment order failed to comply with G.S. 122C-271(b), the patient failed to appeal from the initial order or request a supplemental hearing as
                        permitted by G.S. 122C-272. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2209 (2009), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 241</cite>,

                    <p>
                        In a case in which a trial court’s order recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, while he used the phrase subject matter jurisdiction,
                        he was actually arguing that the trial court did not have authority to order an 180-day commitment under G.S. 122C-271(b). There was no dispute that the trial court had authority to adjudicate the issues in dispute and had jurisdiction
                        over the parties, as a result, the trial court’s May 21, 2007 order was not void, even if contrary to law; the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the civil commitment proceedings when the petition and affidavit were filed pursuant
                        to G.S. 122C-261. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2209 (2009), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 241</cite>,

                    Judgment of the district court is final. Appeal may be had to the Court of Appeals by the State or by any party on the record as in civil cases. Appeal does not stay the commitment unless so ordered by the Court of Appeals. The Attorney General represents
                    the State’s interest on appeal. The district court retains limited jurisdiction for the purpose of hearing all reviews, rehearings, or supplemental hearings allowed or required under this Part.

                        Discharge does not render questions challenging the involuntary commitment proceeding moot in view of the adverse consequences which could arise therefrom, including the possibility that the commitment could form the basis of a future commitment. In re

                        In order to challenge the improper commitment period contained in the trial court’s May 21, 2007 order, the patient was required to appeal that 2007 order pursuant to G.S. 122C-272 or to request a supplemental hearing under G.S. 122C-274(e). In re Webber,

                        In a case in which a trial court issued an order recommitting a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because his initial commitment order in 2007 provided
                        for a term of outpatient commitment that exceeded the period authorized by the governing statute, and the initial commitment period expired as a matter of law, the patient’s appeal was an improper collateral attack on the 2007
                        commitment order. It was undisputed on appeal that the trial court’s May 21, 2007 commitment order failed to comply with G.S. 122C-271(b), the patient failed to appeal from the initial order or request a supplemental hearing as
                        permitted by G.S. 122C-272. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2209 (2009), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 241</cite>,

                        The 15-day period of former G.S. 122-58.11 did not have the effect of a statute of limitations so as to necessitate dismissal of a proceeding brought on less notice. Dismissal was too drastic, and unless the respondent could show some prejudice, the proper

                        Trial court has authority to order a conditional release under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-277, because the pain language in G.S. 122C-277 indicates that the General Assembly intended conditional
                        release as a dispositional option in the insanity acquittee involuntary commitment context; construing the Act, G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia, it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing
                        the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent’s treating physician or whether it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory
                        mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release
                        in an automatically calendared proceeding. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                        Trial court erred in recommitting a respondent who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity to involuntary inpatient treatment because the trial court, which was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, made its
                        findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law, and since the trial court did not make findings of fact that there was a reasonable probability that respondent’s seriously violent conduct would be repeated
                        and that he would be dangerous to others in the future in the absence of an unconditional release, the court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would
                        still have recommitted respondent; a trial court has authority following a hearing under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional
                        release of an insanity acquittee. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                        The trial court correctly found the appellant “dangerous to others,” under this section and G.S. 122C-3(11), in spite of the appellant’s objection that murders which happened 10 years in the past should not be considered because of their “remoteness,”
                        where, from both evidentiary and medical perspectives, the nature of his crimes was more important than their timing, and where the court’s findings on his dangerousness were also rooted in additional evidence unrelated to his
                        prior crimes, including (1) his past and present mental illness, (2) his behavior since July 17, 1988 (including “slaw incident” during which he became upset and angry with his job supervisor over his co-worker’s premature disposal
                        of coleslaw from the hospital grill where he was employed), and (3) his high likelihood of post-release relapse into multi-substance abuse, which all experts agreed was a trigger for his 1988 psychosis during which he killed four
                        people and wounded several others. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 532 S.E.2d 553, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 820 (2000).

                        Because respondent, who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity, failed to present any argument to the trial court that conditional release was a dispositional alternative under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance
                        Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-276.1, he failed to properly preserve the issue for appellate review; however, the court of appeals addressed the issue to prevent manifest injustice to respondent because the assumption that the only
                        alternative to recommitment was an unconditional release was a fundamental aspect of the State’s argument for continued inpatient commitment and a critical component of the trial court’s order, and the issue presented by respondent’s
                        appeal would arise in every recommitment hearing of a person who had been committed by virtue of having been found not guilty by reason of insanity.

        Conditional Release of Insanity Acquittee. —

                    <p>
                        Trial court has authority to order a conditional release under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-277, because the pain language in G.S. 122C-277 indicates that the General Assembly intended conditional
                        release as a dispositional option in the insanity acquittee involuntary commitment context; construing the Act, G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia, it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing
                        the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent’s treating physician or whether it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory
                        mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release
                        in an automatically calendared proceeding. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in recommitting a respondent who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity to involuntary inpatient treatment because the trial court, which was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, made its
                        findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law, and since the trial court did not make findings of fact that there was a reasonable probability that respondent’s seriously violent conduct would be repeated
                        and that he would be dangerous to others in the future in the absence of an unconditional release, the court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would
                        still have recommitted respondent; a trial court has authority following a hearing under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional
                        release of an insanity acquittee. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1382 (2009).

                    for an examination would endanger life or property, the clerk or magistrate shall order the law enforcement officer to take the respondent directly to a 24-hour facility described in G.S. 122C-252.

                        in the community crisis services plan adopted pursuant to G.S. 122C-202.2 that has an available commitment examiner and is capable of performing a first examination in conjunction with a health screening in the same location, unless
                        circumstances indicate the respondent appears to be suffering a medical emergency in which case the law enforcement officer will seek immediate medical assistance for the respondent. If a commitment examiner is not available, whether

                        same location, the person designated to provide transportations shall take the respondent to a private hospital or clinic, a general hospital, an acute care hospital, or a State facility for individuals with mental illnesses. If
                        a commitment examiner is not immediately available, the respondent may be temporarily detained in an area facility if one is available; if an area facility is not available, the respondent may be detained under appropriate supervision,

                        either behavioral health or medical services.

                        Trial court erred in denying a city’s motion for summary judgment in a wife’s action alleging negligence per se, arguing that police officers violated G.S. 122C-301 by failing to assist a person believed to be intoxicated because the public duty doctrine
                        applied to bar the wife’s negligence per se claim; the statute was inapplicable because the officers determined that the wife’s husband was not intoxicated. Scott v.

                    In addition to the actions authorized by G.S. 122C-301(a), an officer may assist an individual found intoxicated in a public place by directing or transporting that individual to a city or county jail. That action may be taken only if the intoxicated
                    individual is apparently in need of and apparently unable to provide for himself food, clothing, or shelter but is not apparently in need of immediate medical care and if no other facility is readily available to receive him. The officer
                    and employees of the jail are exempt from liability as provided in G.S. 122C-301(b). The intoxicated individual may be detained at the jail only until he becomes sober or a maximum of 24 hours and may be released at any time to a relative
                    or other individual willing to be responsible for his care.

                        There was no plain error in failing to instruct a jury on defendant’s right to resist an unlawful arrest because, while an attempt to take defendant to detox against defendant’s will was an arrest, an officer had objective probable cause to arrest defendant
                        for second degree trespass when defendant remained at an apartment complex after the officer, with authority, instructed defendant to leave, even though defendant was not arrested for that offense. State v. Burwell,

                    <p>
                        The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find
                        that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but, that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and
                        humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this Compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization
                        or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in term of
                        such welfare.

                <p>
                    “(1) The Camp Butner reservation is administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter ‘Secretary’) in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes (the Camp Butner reservation is variously referred to, in whole or in part, as the Camp Butner reservation, the Town of Butner, and the Community of Butner and in this act shall be referred to as the ‘Butner

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) The utilities were transferred to the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority (‘SGWASA’) pursuant to the provisions of Session Law 2006-159 which also provides that SGWASA shall pay to the Department a sum, indexed to inflation, as set out in that
                    legislation to support the operations of the Butner Reservation including the Town of Butner.

                    (25¢) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) valuation of all real and personal property to the Butner Public Safety Division of the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety [now the Department of Public Safety].

                    Session Laws 1999-140, s. 5, amended this section effective when a majority of the members of the Butner Advisory Council created pursuant to G.S. 122C-413 (now repealed) as enacted by Session Laws 1999-140 have been elected and qualified. G.S. 122C-413

                    Session Laws 2007-269, s. 14.1, provides: “Section 1.1 through 14 of this act shall become effective only if the Charter of the Town of Butner is approved under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; provided, however, that if the Charter is not
                    approved under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because of any provisions contained in Article III or Article IV of the Charter, the Butner Advisory Council established in accordance with G.S. 122C-413 may make such amendments
                    to the Article III or IV of the Charter as it, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to obtain such approval, and such amendments shall be filed in accordance with G.S. 160A-111. If the Charter is not approved, Sections 1.1 through
                    14 of this act have no force and effect. If the Charter is approved, then those sections become effective on the first day of the next calendar month that begins more than three days after the approval, except that the persons appointed
                    as temporary officers under Section 3.2 of the Charter may immediately take the oath of office and take such preliminary actions as may be necessary for initial organization, personnel actions, and budget adoption, in such special

                    of the intersection of Rural Paved Roads 1103 and 1106 and bounded by those roads and the boundaries of said reservation and said sanitary district, provided, however, that those portions of said lands within the corporate limits of

                    “(b) The territorial jurisdiction set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall constitute the Butner Fire and Police Protection District. The tax collectors of Durhamand Granville Counties shall annually collect a tax of twenty-five cents (25) per

                    General Statutes, is a unique State resource that is and should continue to be administered by the State of North Carolina through the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There is a resident population in the Community
                    of Butner that does not have elected representation with respect to public services, such as police and fire protection, and the provision of water and sewers, that would normally be under the control of an elected city council or
                    board of county commissioners. The citizens of the Camp Butner reservation should be permitted to elect a representative body to act as the voice of the affected people of Butner with regard to the provision of public services and
                    planning for the future of the Camp Butner reservation.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2007-269, s. 14.3, provides: “Section 14 of this act removes the territory within the corporate limits of the Town of Butner from the Butner Police and Fire Protection District provided by Section 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.830.html" target="_blank">Chapter 830</a></cite>                    of the 1983 Session Laws, as amended. Since this act will become effective after July 1, 2007, with respect to taxes on property located within the corporate limits, for taxes levied for the 2007-2008 fiscal year, if the incorporation
                    becomes effective, Granville County shall remit to the Town of Butner rather than to the State General Fund the taxes collected for that district on properties located within the corporate limits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
                    if Granville County does not bill the Butner Police and Fire Protection District tax for fiscal year 2007-2008 on properties located within the proposed corporate limits until either the incorporation is either precleared or rejected
                    under Section 5, those taxes are released or refunded if the incorporation is precleared, or shall be billed if the incorporation is rejected.”

                <p>
                    “(1) The Camp Butner reservation is administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter ‘Secretary’) in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes (the Camp Butner reservation is variously referred to, in whole or in part, as the Camp Butner reservation, the Town of Butner, and the Community of Butner and in this act shall be referred to as the ‘Butner

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(3) The operation of the Town of Butner is not a core function of the Department, and the Department’s mission would not be negatively impacted by the incorporation of the Town of Butner.

                <p>
