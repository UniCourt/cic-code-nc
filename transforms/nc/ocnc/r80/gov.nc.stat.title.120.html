                <p>
                    Session Laws 2002-1 enacted a House Redistricting Plan (“Proposed House Plan - Sutton 5”) and a Senate Redistricting Plan (“Proposed Senate Plan - Fewer Divided Counties”), which were created to correct constitutional deficiencies found by the North Carolina
                    Supreme Court in Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002), in Sutton House Plan 3 (enacted by Session Laws 2001-458) and in NC Senate Plan 1C (enacted by Session Laws
                    2001-459). The House and Senate Redistricting Plans were ratified on May 17, 2002, and became Session Laws 2002-1 on May 20, 2002.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both plans were subsequently held constitutionally invalid by the North Carolina Superior Court in Stephenson v. Bartlett, No. 01 CVS 2885 (N.C. Sup. Ct. May 31, 2002). In their place, the North Carolina Superior Court, on May 31, 2002, presented “Interim
                    House Redistricting Plan for NC 2002 Elections” and “Interim Senate Redistricting Plan for NC 2002 Elections,” and ordered that, upon preclearance by the United States Department of Justice under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act
                    of 1965, the plans be immediately implemented so that the election process could proceed forthwith. Preclearance was received from the United States Department of Justice by letter dated July 12, 2002.

                    Session Laws 2003-434, s. 1st Ex. Sess., 5.(c), provides: “The State Board of Elections shall be governed by the following limitations:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) Any postponement of the candidate filing period or the primary shall apply to all offices whose primary elections are regularly scheduled on primary day, so that there is one candidate filing period for all those offices and one primary election
                    for all those offices. The postponement shall also apply to any elections to local office held on that date (such as elections for boards of education under G.S. 115C-37) and the filing period for those offices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(2) The State Board of Elections does not have the authority to dispense with a second primary. The State Board shall provide for a second primary in its schedule to any candidate entitled to call for a second primary under the provisions of G.S. 163-111.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    “(4) Before making its decision to postpone a filing period or primary election under this section, the State Board of Elections shall consult with the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, and the leaders
                    of both political parties in the House and Senate.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) On July 27, 2011, the General Assembly enacted Session Law 2011-402 to realign the North Carolina Senatorial districts following the return of the 2010 federal decennial Census.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(2) Session Law 2011-402, Rucho Senate 2, was drafted with the assistance of computer software designed to convert the map and supporting block assignment file to a textual explanation of the districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(3) Due to a coding error in the computer software, certain Census blocks were not assigned to any district in the textual explanation of Session Law 2011-402.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) G.S. 120-1(d), as enacted by Session Law 2011-402, provides for assignment of unassigned areas, and that language results in districts that at times do not consist of contiguous territory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) All illustrative information, including the map and supporting block assignment file and statistics, provided to members of the General Assembly and the public during the legislative debate in July 2011 showed those Census blocks as assigned to a
                    district.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(6) The map and supporting block assignment file and statistics formed the basis of the General Assembly’s understanding of and actual legislative intent for the districts as enacted in Session Law 2011-402.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(7) The purpose of this act is to cure Session Law 2011-402 and conform the textual explanation of the North Carolina Senatorial districting plan to the actual legislative intent as depicted by the map and supporting block assignment file and statistics
                    reviewed by the General Assembly in July 2011.
                </p>
                <p>

                    holding unconstitutional G.S. 120-1(a) as it existed prior to the enactment of this act (or the decision is otherwise enjoined, made inoperable, or ineffective), and in any such case the prior version of G.S. 120-1(a) is again effective.”
                    The prior version of subsection (a) reads as follows: “For the purpose of nominating and electing members of the Senate in 2018 and every two years thereafter, senatorial districts are established and seats in the Senate are apportioned

                        Because the General Assembly enacted its 2001 legislative redistricting plans (Session Laws 2001-458 and 2001-459) in violation of the whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II, §§ 3(3) and 5(3), these plans are unconstitutional and are therefore
                        void. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377, 2002 N.C. LEXIS 420 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of the State Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member districts advances a compelling state interest;
                        hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that the use of such districts advances a compelling
                        state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377, 2002 N.C. LEXIS 420 (2002).

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2002-1 enacted a House Redistricting Plan (“Proposed House Plan - Sutton 5”) and a Senate Redistricting Plan (“Proposed Senate Plan - Fewer Divided Counties”), which were created to correct constitutional deficiencies found by the North Carolina
                    Supreme Court in Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002), in Sutton House Plan 3 (enacted by Session Laws 2001-458) and in NC Senate Plan 1C (enacted by Session Laws
                    2001-459). The House and Senate Redistricting Plans were ratified on May 17, 2002, and became Session Laws 2002-1 on May 20, 2002.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both plans were subsequently held constitutionally invalid by the North Carolina Superior Court in Stephenson v. Bartlett, No. 01 CVS 2885 (N.C. Sup. Ct. May 31, 2002). In their place, the North Carolina Superior Court, on May 31, 2002, presented “Interim
                    House Redistricting Plan for NC 2002 Elections” and “Interim Senate Redistricting Plan for NC 2002 Elections,” and ordered that, upon preclearance by the United States Department of Justice under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act
                    of 1965, the plans be immediately implemented so that the election process could proceed forthwith. Preclearance was received from the United States Department of Justice by letter dated July 12, 2002.

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) Any postponement of the candidate filing period or the primary shall apply to all offices whose primary elections are regularly scheduled on primary day, so that there is one candidate filing period for all those offices and one primary election
                    for all those offices. The postponement shall also apply to any elections to local office held on that date (such as elections for boards of education under G.S. 115C-37) and the filing period for those offices.

                <p>
                    “(2) The State Board of Elections does not have the authority to dispense with a second primary. The State Board shall provide for a second primary in its schedule to any candidate entitled to call for a second primary under the provisions of G.S. 163-111.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    “(4) Before making its decision to postpone a filing period or primary election under this section, the State Board of Elections shall consult with the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Speakers of the House of Representatives, and the leaders

                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) On July 28, 2011, the General Assembly enacted Session Law 2011-404 to realign the North Carolina House of Representatives districts following the return of the 2010 federal decennial Census.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(2) Session Law 2011-404, Lewis Dollar Dockham 4, was drafted with the assistance of computer software designed to convert the map and supporting block assignment file to a textual explanation of the districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(3) Due to a coding error in the computer software, certain Census blocks were not assigned to any district in the textual explanation of Session Law 2011-404.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) G.S. 120-2(d), as enacted by Session Law 2011-404, provides for assignment of unassigned areas, and that language results in districts that at times do not consist of contiguous territory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) All illustrative information, including the map and supporting block assignment file and statistics, provided to members of the General Assembly and the public during the legislative debate in July 2011 showed those Census blocks as assigned to a
                    district.

                </p>
                <p>

                    and statistics reviewed by the General Assembly in July 2011.

                        Because the General Assembly enacted its 2001 legislative redistricting plans (Session Laws 2001-458 and 2001-459) in violation of the whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II, §§ 3(3) and 5(3), these plans are unconstitutional and are therefore
                        void. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377, 2002 N.C. LEXIS 420 (2002).

                        Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause of the State Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member districts advances a compelling state interest;
                        hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that the use of such districts advances a compelling
                        state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377, 2002 N.C. LEXIS 420 (2002).

                        In reviewing a redistricting case, the Supreme Court of North Carolina followed the directive of G.S. 120-2.3 that each defect in a plan be identified, as the legislature had to know with specificity how a defective district failed to meet constitutional
                        and statutory standards. Pender County v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 491</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 364, 2007 N.C. LEXIS 816 (2007), aff'd, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 173 L. Ed. 2d 173, 2009 U.S.

                    A Retirement System is established and placed under the Board of Trustees of the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System for administrative purposes. This Retirement System is a governmental plan, within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal
                    Revenue Code. Therefore, the nondiscrimination rules of Sections 401(a)(5) and 401(a)(26) of the Code do not apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Retirement System shall have all the power and privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the “Legislative Retirement System of North Carolina.” By this name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested and all of its
                    cash and securities and other property held. All direction and policies concerning the Legislative Retirement System shall be vested in the Board of Trustees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistent with Section 401(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, all member employee and employer contributions to this Retirement System shall be made to funds held in trust through trust instruments that have the purposes of distributing trust principal
                    and income to retired members and their beneficiaries and of paying other definitely determinable benefits under this Chapter, after meeting the necessary expenses of administering this Retirement System. Neither the trust corpus nor
                    income from this trust can be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, except that employer contributions made to the trust under a good faith mistake of fact may be returned to an employer,
                    where the refund can occur within less than one year after the mistaken contribution was made, consistent with the rule adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Retirement System shall have a consolidated Plan document, consisting of
                    relevant statutory provisions in this Chapter, associated regulations in the North Carolina Administrative Code, substantive and procedural information on the official forms used by the Retirement System, and policies and minutes of
                    the Board of Trustees.

                    of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, Public Law 103-353, if that service begins during the member’s term of office. If the participant does not return immediately after that service to employment with a

                        This subsection applies to distributions and rollovers from the Plan. The Plan does not have mandatory distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to distributions from the Plan and notwithstanding
                        any other provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee’s election under this Article, a distributee (including, after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse beneficiary if that non-spouse beneficiary
                        elects a direct rollover only to an inherited traditional or Roth IRA as permitted under applicable federal law) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible
                        rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. As used in this subsection, an “eligible retirement plan” means an individual retirement account described in
                        Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, on and after January 1, 2009, a Roth IRA, or a qualified trust described
                        in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution. Effective on and after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
                        Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
                        account for amounts transferred into that plan from this Plan. As used in this subsection, a “direct rollover” is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Provided, an eligible rollover
                        distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
                        equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary,
                        or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
                        without regard to the exclusion for net realized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Effective as of January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding the exclusion of any after-tax portion from such a rollover distribution in
                        the preceding sentence, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. That portion
                        may be transferred, pursuant to applicable federal law, to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, to a qualified defined benefit plan, or to a qualified defined contribution
                        plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
                        and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
                        payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a court-ordered equitable distribution of marital property, as provided under G.S. 50-20.1. Effective on and after
                        January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator of the Board of Trustees of this Retirement
                        System, to directly roll over any portion of the beneficiary’s distribution from the Retirement System; however, such rollover shall conform with the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code.

                    G.S. 120-47.7B, as enacted by Session Laws 2005-456, and as amended by Session Laws 2006-201, s. 16, was effective from August 4, 2006, to January 1, 2007. As enacted the section read: “§ 120-47.7B. Powers and duties of the Secretary of State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(a) The Secretary of State shall perform systematic reviews of reports required to be filed under former G.S. 120-47.6 and G.S. 120-47.7 (repealed) on a regular basis to assure complete and timely disclosure of expenditures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(b) The Secretary of State may petition the Superior Court of Wake County for the approval to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum as necessary to conduct investigations of violations of this Article. The court shall authorize subpoenas under this
                    subsection when the court determines they are necessary for the enforcement of this Article. Subpoenas issued pursuant to this subsection shall be enforceable by the court through contempt powers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(c) Complaints of violations of this Article and all other records accumulated in conjunction with the investigation of these complaints shall be considered records of criminal investigations under G.S. 132-1.4.”.

                    Session Laws 2006-264, s. 99.4(a), effective January 1, 2007, amended G.S. 120-47.7B, by adding subsection (d), which read: “Any person, when in doubt about the applicability and interpretation of this article in a particular context, may submit in writing
                    the facts of the situation to the Secretary of State with a request for a written opinion to establish the standard of duty regarding compliance with this Article. Any such opinion so issued shall specifically refer to this subsection.
                    No person shall be subject to prosecution or civil action for failure to comply with this Article if the person has relied upon and complied with a written opinion issued by the Secretary of State under this subsection.” Due to the
                    repeal of Article 9A by Session Laws 2006-201, s. 17, effective January 1, 2007, the amendment has not been given effect, and the section is set out above as repealed.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2014-120, s. 44(a)-(c), as amended by 2015-241, s. 14.9, provides: “(a) It is the intent of the General Assembly to enhance shellfish habitats within the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds and their tributaries to benefit fisheries, water quality,
                    and the economy. This will be achieved through the establishment of a network of oyster sanctuaries, harvestable enhancement sites, and coordinated support for the development of shellfish aquaculture. The network of oyster sanctuaries
                    is to be named in honor of Senator Jean Preston and shall be called the ‘Senator Jean Preston Oyster Sanctuary Network’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(b) The Division of Marine Fisheries of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall develop a plan to construct and manage additional oyster habitats. The new sanctuaries, along with selected existing oyster sanctuaries, shall be included
                    in the Senator Jean Preston Oyster Sanctuary Network. The plan shall include the following components:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(1) Location and delineation of oyster sanctuaries. — The plan should include locations for sanctuary network components that minimize the impact on commercial trawling. The location of sanctuaries shall take into account connectivity to existing oyster
                    sanctuaries and proposed oyster enhancement sites. New oyster sanctuaries shall be designed to provide hook-and-line fishing while allowing the development of complex fish habitats and brood-stock oysters that will enhance recruitment
                    in the surrounding reefs. The plan should outline a 10-year development project to accomplish the expansion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(2) [Repealed by Session Laws 2015-241, s. 14.9.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(3) Enhancement of oyster habitat restoration. — The General Assembly finds that the lack of a reliable State-based supply of oyster seed and inadequate funding for cultch planting are limitations to the expansion of oyster harvesting and the restoration
                    of wild oyster habitat in North Carolina. Therefore, the plan should include the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “a. Provisions and recommendations to facilitate the availability of oyster seed produced in North Carolina for wild oyster habitat restoration projects as well as oyster aquaculture and to reduce potential negative impacts from importation of non-native
                    oyster seed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “b. Plans , where feasible, for public-private partnerships for State-based production of viable oyster seed through the creation of one or more production hatcheries and recommendations for increased support of the existing research hatchery at UNC-Wilmington.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “c. Plans and cost estimates for an expansion of cultch planting in suitable areas of the State’s coastal waters in order to expand areas suitable for development of wild oyster habitat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) Economic relief. — The plan should consider a waiver of application fees and yearly rental fees for new shellfish leases for an established period of time to further promote and support shellfish aquaculture in North Carolina. The new leasing fee
                    waiver program should include measures to discourage speculation and target persons with a genuine interest in starting a shellfish aquaculture business, such as a requirement that the lease be nontransferable for a five-year period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(5) Outreach. — The plan should include outreach and education that promotes, whenever possible, public-private partnerships utilizing the Sea Grant College Program, local colleges, and other nongovernmental organizations to (i) encourage shellfish aquaculture
                    and provide technical assistance to broaden cost-effective technologies available to leaseholders; (ii) encourage best management practices to leaseholders; and (iii) inform fishermen and the public on the benefits provided by the
                    Senator Jean Preston Oyster Sanctuary Network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(6) Monitoring. — The plan should include a monitoring plan designed to (i) determine the success of oyster reef construction and (ii) evaluate the cost benefit of the oyster sanctuary network and harvestable enhancement sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(7) Funding. — The plan should include a request for appropriations sufficient for Division staff to expand oyster restoration and monitoring activities for 10 years. The plan should provide that, whenever possible, public-private partnerships are employed
                    to meet the construction, seeding, and outreach requirements of the plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(8) Recommendations. — The plan shall include recommendations for statutory or regulatory changes needed to expedite the expansion of shellfish restoration and harvesting in order to improve water quality, restore ecological habitats, provide enhanced
                    recreational and commercial fishing opportunities, and expand the coastal economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(9) No funding for sanctuaries in closed areas. - The plan shall provide that no funding or other resources shall be available in water bodies where a moratorium or other legal prohibition on shellfish leasing under Article 16 of
                    <cite
                        class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113.html" target="_blank">Chapter 113</a></cite> of the General Statutes is currently in effect. This subdivision does not apply to leasing moratoria imposed because the area is closed to shellfish harvesting
                        or recommended for closure by the State Health Director due to pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(c) No later than March 1, 2016, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall report to the Chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Agriculture and Natural and Economic Resources, the Senate Appropriations Committee
                    on Natural and Economic Resources, and the Fiscal Research Division regarding its implementation of this section and its recommended plan.”

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2015-196, s. 1 provides: “The Environmental Review Commission, with the assistance of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources [now Department of Environmental Quality], shall study the aggregate uses of groundwater and surface
                    water in or affecting the Cape Fear River Basin by all users, including, but not limited to, public water systems, industrial facilities, and agricultural operations. The study shall include all of the following elements: (i) a summary
                    of the current and 50-year projected water-use demands along with the available water supplies for those portions of Alamance, Bladen, Brunswick, Caswell, Chatham, Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin, Durham, Guilford, Harnett, Hoke, Lee,
                    Moore, New Hanover, Onslow, Orange, Pender, Randolph, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Sampson, Scotland, and Wake counties within the Cape Fear River Basin; (ii) an evaluation of the adequacy of currently available supplies to meet
                    the expected long-term needs for all water demands, including the identification of those areas of the basin that do not have a sustainable long-term water supply for the anticipated growth of that area; (iii) the identification of
                    potential conflicts among the various users and recommendations for developing and enhancing coordination among users and groups of users in order to avoid or minimize those conflicts; and (iv) an enhanced review of the portions of
                    the Cape Fear River Basin within Brunswick, New Hanover, and Pender counties addressing the increased demands on groundwater and limited surface water options in that area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “All the information and any analytical tools, such as models, employed in the conduct of the study shall be made available electronically for public review and use on the Web site of the Department’s Division of Water Resources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rapid increase in the functions and costs of State government and the complexity of agency operations deeply concern the General Assembly. Members of the General Assembly have the ultimate responsibility for making public policy decisions and deciding
                    on appropriations of public moneys. Knowledge of the public service needs being met, having evidence as to whether previous policy and appropriations have resulted in expected program benefits, and data on how State government reorganization
                    has affected agency operations are most important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legislative examination and review of public policies, expenditures and reorganization implementation as an integral part of legislative duties and responsibilities should be strengthened. For the purpose of performing such continuing examination and
                    evaluation of State agencies, [and] their actual effectiveness in programming and in carrying out procedures under reorganization, the General Assembly herein provides for the continuing review of operations of State government.

                    Every bill, which creates or modifies any provision for the retirement of public officers or public employees or for the payment of retirement benefits or of pensions to public officers or public employees, shall, upon introduction in either house of
                    the General Assembly, be referred to the Committee on Pensions and Retirement of each house. When the bill is reported out of committee it shall be accompanied by a written report by the Committee on Pensions and Retirement containing,
                    among other matters which the Committee deems relevant, the actuarial note required by Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120</a></cite> of the General
                    Statutes, and pursuant to the Rules of the General Assembly, and an evaluation of the proposed legislation’s actuarial soundness and adherence to sound retirement and pension policy. Any bill referred to the Committee on Pensions and
                    Retirement cannot be further considered by that house until such bill has received a favorable report, a report without prejudice, or has been recalled from that committee.

                <p>
                    Whenever a bill is considered by the Committee on Pensions and Retirement that proposes changes in the benefits of any State-administered retirement or pension plan to be financed by unencumbered actuarial experience gains generated either through a change
                    in actuarial assumptions adopted by the plan for the previous budget year or through a continuation of the actuarial assumptions adopted by the plan for the previous budget year, the Committee shall give equal consideration to the
                    effects that such unencumbered actuarial gains would have upon annual employer or State contributions to the plan and to the amount by which the plan’s unfunded accrued liabilities, if any, might be reduced. If such unencumbered actuarial
                    experience gains could be used to modify annual employer or State contributions to the plan resulting in a corresponding effect upon State appropriations, the Committee on Pensions and Retirement shall, upon a favorable report, refer
                    the bill to the Committee on Appropriations of the same house before the bill is considered by that house.

                    When a vacancy occurs in any office subject to appointment by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, upon the recommendation of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, or upon the recommendation of
                    the President of the Senate, and the vacancy occurs either: (i) after election of the General Assembly but before convening of the regular session; (ii) when the General Assembly has adjourned to a date certain, which date is more
                    than 20 days after the date of adjournment; (iii) after sine die adjournment of the regular session; or (iv) when the term of office expires and a successor has not been appointed, then the Governor may appoint a person to serve until
                    the expiration of the term or until the General Assembly fills the vacancy, whichever occurs first. The General Assembly may fill the vacancy in accordance with G.S. 120-121 during a regular or extra session. When a person is holding
                    over in office after the expiration of the term, for the purpose of this section that office may be filled as if it were vacant. Before making an appointment, the Governor shall consult the officer who recommended the original appointment
                    to the General Assembly (the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, or the President of the Senate), and ask for a written recommendation. After receiving the written recommendation, the Governor
                    must within 30 days either appoint the person recommended or inform the officer who made the recommendation that he is rejecting the recommendation. Failure to act within 30 days as required under the provisions of the preceding sentence
                    shall be deemed to be approval of the candidate, and the candidate shall be eligible to enter the office in as full and ample extent as if the Governor had executed the appointment. The Governor shall not appoint a person other than
                    the person so recommended. Any position subject to initial appointment by the General Assembly but not filled prior to sine die adjournment of the Session at which the position was created or adjournment to a date certain which date
                    is more than 20 days after the date of adjournment of the session at which the position was created may be filled by the Governor under this section as if it were a vacancy occurring after the General Assembly had made an appointment.

                    opinion on the constitutionality of Sections 5 and 6 of this act and the appointment of the chief hearing officer by the Chief Justice as provided in G.S. 7A-752 in Section 2 of this act.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 19 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, provided that sections 5 and 6 of the act, which added G.S. 143A-55.2 through 143A-55.6 and added subdivision (1a) of this section, would become effective 30 days from the date the Supreme Court issued an advisory
                    opinion on the constitutionality of those sections unless the opinion stated that those sections were unconstitutional, in which event those sections would not become effective. Section 19 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, further provided
                    that the act would not affect contested cases commenced before Jan. 1, 1986. Furthermore, Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 19 provided that the act would expire Jan. 1, 1992, and would not be effective on or after that date. However,
                    this expiration provision was deleted by Session Laws 1991, c. 103, s. 1.

                    Ports Authority to status as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. Subsections (a) through (e) of this section become effective only if an opinion is issued that it does not subject the State Ports Authority to status
                    as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act, and in such case subsections (a) through (e) of this section become effective upon the issuance of the opinion. In lieu of subsections (a) through (e) of this section, if the North
                    Carolina State Ports Authority finds that the transfer of any stock owned by the North Carolina Ports Railway Commission to the North Carolina State Ports Authority will accomplish the same end as the transfer of assets of the North
                    Carolina Ports Railway Commission, it may order such transfer if the Attorney General issues an opinion it does not subject the State Ports Authority to status as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act, and in such case
                    the transfer becomes effective 60 days after it is ordered.” Session Laws 2002-126, s. 6.6(b), provided for the repeal of G.S. 120-123(25).

                        By letter of October 28, 1985, addressed to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, the Supreme Court declined to issue an advisory opinion as contemplated by Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 18.2, on the grounds that to issue such an opinion
                        would be to place the court directly in the stream of the legislative process, and in view of the prerogative of the General Assembly to first address and determine the constitutionality of its own legislation. See In re Advisory

                    Communications between legislators and members of the public about redistricting issues are generally public records without any limitation as to the date of the communications; however, communications between legislators and legislative employees, including
                    employees serving as legal counsel to members, become public records only upon the date of the enactment of the redistricting plan which is the subject of the communications; and each legislator is properly treated as the custodian
                    of his or her e-mail communications whether directly available in the legislator’s computer or stored in the legislature’s computer system. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Terrence D. Sullivan, Director, Research Division, North

                    Session Laws 2021-180, s. 38.12, provides: “The Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology (JLOCIT) shall conduct a study of best practices and make recommendations for legislative proposals to formulate a new budget and cost accounting
                    model for State information technology goods and services provided to State agencies by the Department of Information Technology (DIT). The JLOCIT shall do at least the following in conducting this examination:

                    “(1) Evaluate the current internal service fund rate structure under G.S. 143B 1333, including the methodologies used by DIT in setting rates and fees and whether industry standards are reflected for the goods and services for which State agencies are
                    charged. The specific matters for review include, but are not limited to, whether those rates and fees are (i) understandable, (ii) priced on usage, (iii) predictable for planning purposes, (iv) related to value received, (v) priced
                    competitively with open market services, and (vi) readily adjustable to factor in unplanned events.

                <p>

                <p>
                    “(4) Examine how replacement costs are accounted for and built into State agency operating budgets.

                <p>
                    “(5) Review whether some State agencies should pay for information technology using the current or a similar rate system or if some should have information technology charges and costs funded differently.

                    Session Laws 2017-57, s. 11D.3(a), (b), provides: “(a) Pursuant to the authority in G.S. 120-208.2(d), the cochairs for the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services may consider appointing a subcommittee on aging to examine the
                    State’s delivery of services for older adults in order to (i) determine their service needs and to (ii) make recommendations to the Oversight Committee on how to address those needs. North Carolina currently ranks ninth in the nation
                    for the size of the age 60 and older population and tenth in the nation for the age 85 and older population. From 2015 to 2035, the age 65 and older population is projected to increase sixty-seven percent (67%) and the age 85 and older
                    population is projected to increase one hundred two percent (102%). By 2019, North Carolina will have more people that are 60 years of age and older than children age zero to 17. It is recommended that the subcommittee examine the
                    range of programs and services for older adults throughout the continuum of care. The subcommittee is encouraged to seek input from a variety of stakeholders and interest groups, including the Division of Aging and Adult Services and
                    the Division of Social Services, Department of Health and Human Services; the North Carolina Coalition on Aging; the North Carolina Senior Tarheel Legislature, and the Governor’s Advisory Council on Aging.

                <p>
                    “(b) If a subcommittee on aging is appointed, the subcommittee shall submit an interim report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services on or before
                    March 1, 2018, and shall submit a final report of its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, on or before November 1, 2018, at which time it shall terminate unless reappointed by the cochairs of the Oversight

                <p>
                    “(1) Evaluate the current internal service fund rate structure under G.S. 143B 1333, including the methodologies used by DIT in setting rates and fees and whether industry standards are reflected for the goods and services for which State agencies are
                    charged. The specific matters for review include, but are not limited to, whether those rates and fees are (i) understandable, (ii) priced on usage, (iii) predictable for planning purposes, (iv) related to value received, (v) priced
                    competitively with open market services, and (vi) readily adjustable to factor in unplanned events.

                    Session Laws 2017-192, s. 12, provides: “The North Carolina Policy Collaboratory (Collaboratory) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shall conduct a study on energy storage technology. The study shall address how energy storage technologies
                    may or may not provide value to North Carolina consumers based on factors that may include capital investment, value to the electric grid, net utility savings, net job creation, impact on consumer rates and service quality, or any
                    other factors related to deploying one or more of these technologies. The study shall also address the feasibility of energy storage in North Carolina, including services energy storage can provide that are not being performed currently,
                    the economic potential or impact of energy storage deployment in North Carolina, and the identification of existing policies and recommended policy changes that may be considered to address a statewide coordinated energy storage policy.
                    The Collaboratory shall provide the results of this study no later than December 1, 2018, to the Energy Policy Council and the Joint Legislative Commission on Energy Policy.”
