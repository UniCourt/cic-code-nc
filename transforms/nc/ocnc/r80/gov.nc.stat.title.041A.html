     What Plaintiff Must Show. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    To prevail under the State Fair Housing Act, plaintiff must show that defendant refused to engage in a real estate transaction with plaintiff due to the plaintiff ’s race, color, religion, sex or national origin. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2120 (1986).
   </p>
   <p>
    In order for this Act to apply,
   
   the discriminatory housing practice must first: (1) occur in a “real estate transaction”, and (2) discriminate “because of” one of the reasons listed in this section. Town of Newton Grove v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 432 S.E.2d 441, <cite class="nc_code">1993 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 779 (1993).
   </p>
   <p>
    Under the Act, race, color, religion, sex or national origin must be more than a mere factor
   
   in a defendant’s decision not to engage in a real estate transaction. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2120 (1986).
   </p>
   <p>
    Statistics describing the disparate impact of practices or policies
   
   may be circumstantial evidence of prohibited biased conduct. However, if the finder of fact reasonably finds that a particular housing practice or policy is not motivated by considerations of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, then the particular housing practice or policy is not a violation of the State Fair Housing Act, no matter how “disparate” the impact of the practice or policy. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2120 (1986).

   <p>
    <b>
     Family Composition Rules in Apartment Complex. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    In a proceeding under the State Fair Housing Act, plaintiff could meet her burden of proof by showing that the facially neutral family composition rules used to deny her application to rent an apartment were promulgated to discriminate against blacks; she could also meet her burden of proof by showing that she could have leased the apartment if she were of another race. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2120 (1986).
   </p>
   <p>
    Defendants failed to meet the threshold question
   
   of showing that plaintiff did not allow defendants to place a mobile home on the property “because of” defendant’s handicapping condition. Town of Newton Grove v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 432 S.E.2d 441, <cite class="nc_code">1993 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 779 (1993).

     Any person who claims to have been injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice or who reasonably believes that he will be irrevocably injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice may file a complaint with the North Carolina Human Relations Commission. A fair housing enforcement organization, as defined in regulations adopted under 42 U.S.C. § 3602 (1968), may file a complaint with the Commission on behalf of a person who claims to have been injured by or reasonably believes he will be irrevocably injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice. Complaints shall be in writing, shall state the facts upon which the allegation of an unlawful discriminatory housing practice is based, and shall contain such other information and be in such form as the Commission requires. Commission employees shall assist complainants in reducing complaints to writing and shall assist in setting forth the information in the complaint as may be required by the Commission. Within 10 days after receipt of the complaint, the Director of the Commission shall serve on the respondent a copy of the complaint and a notice advising the respondent of his procedural rights and obligations under this Chapter. Within 10 days after receipt of the complaint, the Director of the Commission shall serve on the complainant a notice acknowledging the filing of the complaint and informing the complainant of his time limits and choice of forums under this Chapter.No complaint may be filed with the Commission under this section during any period in which the Commission is not certified by the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 3610(f) to have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint. Provided, however, that during any such period in which the Commission is not certified, any person who claims to have been injured by an unlawful discriminatory practice or who reasonably believes that he will be irrevocably injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice may bring a civil action directly in superior court in accordance with the provisions of subsection (j) of this section, except that any such civil action shall be commenced within one year after the occurrence or termination of the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice.
    </li>
    <li id="t41As41A-7ol1b">
     A complaint under subsection (a) shall be filed within one year after the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice occurred. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him within 10 days after receiving a copy of the complaint. With the leave of the Commission, which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, the complaint and the answer may be amended at any time. Complaints and answers shall be verified. The Commission shall make final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year of the date the complaint is filed, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission is unable to do so, it shall notify the complainant and respondent, in writing, of the reasons for not doing so.
    </li>
    <li id="t41As41A-7ol1c">
     Whenever another agency of the State or any other unit of government of the State has jurisdiction over the subject matter of any complaint filed under this section, and such agency or unit of government has legal authority equivalent to or greater than the authority under this Chapter to investigate or act upon the complaint, the Commission shall be divested of jurisdiction over such complaint. The Commission shall, within 30 days, notify the agency or unit of government of the apparent unlawful discriminatory housing practice, and request that the complaint be investigated in accordance with such authority.
    </li>
    <li id="t41As41A-7ol1d">
     Complaints may be resolved at any time by informal conference, conciliation, or persuasion.

    <li id="t41As41A-7ol1e">
     Within 30 days after the filing of the complaint, the Commission shall commence an investigation of the complaint to ascertain the facts relating to the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice. If the complaint is not resolved before the investigation is complete, upon completion of the investigation, the Commission shall determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that an unlawful discriminatory housing practice has occurred. The Commission shall make a determination within 90 days after the filing of the complaint. If the Commission is unable to complete the investigation and issue a determination within 90 days after the filing of the complaint, the Commission shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so. If the Commission concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint under this section that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Chapter, the Commission may commence a civil action for, and the court may grant, appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint. Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, et seq., Rules of Civil Procedure. The commencement of a civil action under this subsection does not affect the continuation of the Commission’s investigation or the initiation of a separate civil action pursuant to other subsections of this section.

     If the Commission finds reasonable grounds to believe that an unlawful discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur it shall proceed to try to eliminate or correct the discriminatory housing practice by informal conference, conciliation, or persuasion. Each conciliation agreement arising out of conciliation efforts by the Commission, whether reached before or after the Commission makes a determination of the complaint pursuant to subsection (e), shall be:
     <ol>

     After the Commission has issued a notice of conciliation failure pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, if the complainant does not request a right-to-sue letter pursuant to subsection (i) of this section, the complainant, the respondent, or the Commission may elect to have the claims and issues asserted in the reasonable grounds determination decided in a civil action commenced and maintained by the Commission.

       An election for a civil action under this subsection shall be made no later than 20 days after an electing complainant or respondent receives the notice of conciliation failure, or if the Commission makes the election, not more than 20 days after the notice of conciliation failure is issued. A complainant or respondent who makes an election for a civil action pursuant to this subsection shall give notice to the Commission. If the Commission makes an election, it shall notify all complainants and respondents of the election.

     The Commission may issue subpoenas to compel access to or the production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may issue interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid of a civil action in the general court of justice.
