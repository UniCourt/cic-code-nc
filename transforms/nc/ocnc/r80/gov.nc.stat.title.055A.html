     North Carolina Commentary
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    This revision of the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act (hereinafter the “Act”) is based in large part upon the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (hereinafter “BCA”). Accordingly, the Act follows the same general organization and numbering system as the BCA and, where appropriate, incorporates the substance of the BCA. Stylistic or other minor differences in language and form between certain sections of the Act and the sections of the BCA from which they are derived are not intended to imply substantive differences.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although the drafters reviewed the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987) (hereinafter the “Model Act”) and adopted certain of its provisions, the Act is substantially different from the Model Act. For that reason, the Official Comments to the Model Act are not included in this commentary.
   </p>
   <p>
    The North Carolina comments are designed to note significant substantive changes from prior law, to highlight certain provisions of the Act that had no counterpart in the prior law and to explain certain provisions of the Act. For any section of the Act that is the same or substantially the same as the corresponding section of the BCA, it is appropriate to refer to the comments to the corresponding BCA section.
   </p>

     Editor’s Note.
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 1993, c. 398, s. 1, effective July 1, 1994, rewrote
   <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> and entitled it the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, to replace former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>, entitled the Nonprofit Corporation Act, which had been adopted by Session Laws 1955, c. 1230.
   </p>
   <p>
    For tables of corresponding sections of former and new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>, see the tables at the end of this Chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2 of Session Laws 1993, c. 398 provides:
   “The Revisor of Statutes shall cause to be printed along with this act all explanatory comments of the drafters of this act as the Revisor may deem appropriate.”
   </p>
   <p>
    The Official Comments appearing under individual sections in this Chapter have been printed by the publisher as received, without editorial change, and relate to the Chapter as originally enacted. However, not all sections in this Chapter may carry Official Comments. Furthermore, Official Comments may or may not have been received or updated in conjunction with subsequent amendments to this Chapter and, therefore, may not reflect all changes to the sections under which they appear.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where they appear in this Chapter, “Amended Comment” usually means that an error in the original comment has been corrected by a subsequent amendment, and “Supplemental Comment” pertains to a later development, such as an amendment to the statute text. North Carolina Comments explain where the General Assembly has enacted variations to the text of the Uniform Act.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where appropriate, the historical citations to sections of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> have been added to corresponding sections in new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of the case notes appearing under the sections of this Chapter were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> or under prior law.

       Appellate court erred in dismissing the pastor’s appeal of the trial court’s denial of the pastor’s motion to dismiss a matter involving a dispute over the use of church funds; merely because the church was a nonprofit corporation pursuant to the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, G.S. 55A-1-01 et seq., did not mean it forfeited its fundamental First Amendment rights.

      This section defines more terms than former G.S. 55A-2. Several definitions deserve special mention:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t55Aa01p04s55A-1-40ol21">
       Charitable or religious corporation

     </ol>
     <p>
      “Charitable or religious corporation” is defined in subdivision (4) to mean a corporation (a) that the Internal Revenue Service has determined is tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) that qualifies for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) but with respect to which no determination has been made by the Internal Revenue Service, or (c) that would qualify for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) if it did not engage in certain prohibited political activities or other disqualifying activities. Section 501(c)(3) generally provides tax exempt status to corporations organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the following purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literacy, educational or prevention of cruelty to children or animals. Certain provisions of the Act apply exclusively to charitable or religious corporations and distributions by charitable or religious corporations are strictly limited by Article 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Distribution” is defined broadly in subdivision (8) to include transfers to, and debt incurred for the benefit of, members, directors, officers and transferees in liquidation. This broad definition effectuates the basic rule that a nonprofit corporation is prohibited from making distributions except as specifically authorized by Article 13.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subdivision (16) makes clear that a person does not have the rights of a member (under Article 16, for example), solely by reason of having voting rights or other rights commonly associated with membership.

Remote shareholder, policyholder, and member meetings noticed before the effective date of this act as a result of the state of emergency declared by Executive Order No. 116 on March 10, 2020, and complying with any subsequent executive orders authorizing remote shareholder, policy holder, or member meetings shall be deemed in compliance with this act. ....”

      The prior law contained no general definition of “notice.” Subdivision (e)(4) recognizes that nonprofit corporations may have special mailing privileges. Notices mailed at the nonprofit rate are effective 30 days after deposit in the United States mail. Many nonprofit corporations include notices in newsletters, magazines and other publications regularly sent to members, and subsection (i) specifically authorizes this form of notice if it is conspicuously identified as a notice.

      This section had no counterpart in the prior law and is adapted from the Model Act. It authorizes the superior court, in its discretion, to prescribe special procedures that will enable a corporation to call and conduct meetings or obtain the consent of members, delegates or directors when it is otherwise impracticable to do so. This section permits judicial relief only if the procedures established in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws or prescribed by statute are not viable under the circumstances and any relief granted should be limited in scope to that necessary to remove the impediment which makes compliance with such procedures impracticable, regardless of whether the impediment prevents a continuation of the corporation’s activities or consideration of dissolution, merger or a sale of the corporation’s assets.

      A nonprofit corporation incorporated on or after July 1, 1994, that is a charitable or religious corporation under G.S. 55A-1-40(4) must include a statement to that effect in its articles of incorporation. It is not necessary to state a corporation’s period of duration, its purpose or its initial board of directors as was required under former G.S. 55A-7.
     </p>
     <p>
      A provision limiting or eliminating the personal liability of directors in certain circumstances may now be included in the articles of incorporation. Although such a provision affects only claims by or on behalf of the corporation and does not relieve directors from liability to third parties, immunity from liability to third parties is available to the extent provided in G.S. 55A-8-60 and G.S. 1-539.10. Use of the term “any director” in subdivision (b)(4) is intended to mean that a corporation is not required to be uniform in its treatment of directors under this subdivision.

      This section eliminates the distinction that former G.S. 55A-15 made between unconditional powers and those exercisable only “in connection with carrying out the purposes stated in its charter.” The authority for nonprofit corporations to make loans to directors or officers who are full-time employees is treated in 55A-8-32.
     </p>
     <p>
      The language “any other person” in the last phrase in subdivision (a)(17) can include a member if the corporation has an insurable interest in the member. Under G.S. 58-58-86, a charitable or religious corporation that purchases or receives by assignment life insurance is deemed to have an insurable interest in the insured person’s life if the insured person consents to the purchase or assignment.

       Homeowners association’s “welfare” covenant was not vague with respect to the levy of a special assessment for legal fees incurred in a discrimination dispute with two homeowners as under the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, specifically G.S. 55A-3-02(a)(1), the association had the power to sue and be sued, and it was foreseeable that the association would have to pay fees to defend itself; the covenant contained an ascertainable standard by which it could be objectively determined if the amount of the assessment and the purpose for which it was levied fell within the covenant.

      Any rights or obligations of a member, and any differentiation of designations, qualifications, rights and obligations among members, must be prescribed pursuant to this section. Except for certain procedural or auxiliary rights, such as the right to bring a derivative action or to inspect corporate records, a member does not have any rights or obligations, such as the right to vote, solely by reason of being a member; and, conversely, G.S. 55A-1-40(16) provides that a person is not a member solely by reason of having voting or other rights normally associated with membership. Thus, for example, there can be voting nonmembers as well as nonvoting members.

       Members of a church, which was a nonprofit corporation under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes, could not turn to G.S. 55A-6-31(a) to claim that their membership in the church was improperly terminated in violation of that statute because the courts of the State of North Carolina did not have jurisdiction in what were ecclesiastical disputes.

       Because a private country club, which was organized as a nonprofit corporation, adhered to its own internal rules and provided certain members with prior notice and an opportunity to be heard, there was no justification for judicial intervention on the members’ behalf when the club terminated the members’ membership in the club.

       Country club (club) member’s declaratory judgment claims seeking (1) a judgment relating to the status of the member’s membership, when the club terminated the membership without prior notice, and (2) as to whether the club could conduct a curative post-termination hearing were moot because any judgment that the manner of termination did not meet a statutory “fair and reasonable and good faith” requirement or that post-termination hearings were impermissible under the statute had no practical effect, since the member could not recover damages due to a failure to mitigate. Emerson v. Cape Fear Country Club, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 817 S.E.2d 402, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 516 (2018).

       When a member sought damages for a country club’s (club) termination of the member’s membership without prior notice, the club was entitled to summary judgment because (1) prior notice was not statutorily required, and, (2) even if the termination were a statutory violation, the member could not recover damages since the member did not mitigate damages.

      This section changes prior law in that (1) the president is not statutorily authorized to call special members’ meetings as under prior law and must now be given that authority by the articles of incorporation or bylaws and (2) formerly, members holding 5% of the votes could call a special meeting in the absence of a provision fixing a different number or percentage, whereas under this section, 10% of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered is required and this percentage cannot be modified by the corporation.

      Former 55A-33 provided that the vote of a majority of “the votes entitled to be cast” at a meeting at which a quorum is present was the act of the members. Subsection (a) provides that “a majority of the votes cast” at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the members, so that members present at a meeting cannot defeat an action by withholding their votes. Subsection (b) had no counterpart in the prior law.

       Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws prohibit or limit proxy voting, a member may vote in person or by proxy. A member may appoint one or more proxies to vote or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointment form, either personally or by the member’s attorney-in-fact. An appointment in the form of an electronic record submitted by a member who has agreed as provided in G.S. 55A-1-70 that either bears the member’s electronic signature or is sent from the member’s designated email address and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by an automated process shall be deemed a valid appointment form within the meaning of this section. In addition, if and to the extent permitted by the nonprofit corporation, a member may appoint one or more proxies by any kind of telephonic transmission, even if not accompanied by written communication, under circumstances or together with information from which the nonprofit corporation can reasonably assume that the appointment was made or authorized by the member.

       An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form.

       An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. An appointment made irrevocable under this subsection shall be revocable when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. A transferee for value of an interest subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not have actual knowledge of its irrevocability.
      </li>
      <li id="t55Aa07p02s55A-7-24ol1d">
       The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy’s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.

      <p>
       G.S. 55A-7-40(a) plainly restricts standing to bring a derivative action to the members and directors of a nonprofit corporation. Thus, by statute, only members, directors, or the attorney general have standing to challenge ultra vires acts of a not-for-profit corporation. Morris v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C.

       Even if the board had exceeded its authority, a member’s derivative action would not have been the appropriate cause of action where plaintiff alleged no injury to the association by the board’s action and was not seeking to recover on behalf of the association.

       G.S. 55A-7-40 did not apply after a condominium owner sought to have a shed removed from a parking space and, thus, the action was not a derivative action. Ocracomax, LLC v.

       Condo owners did not have a “reasonable belief” that there was a “sound chance” that the derivative action alleging negligence could be sustained, as they had no evidence to show that worked performed by the contractor or its agents was the proximate cause of the water damage the owners’ condos sustained.

      Subsection (c) of this section permits a corporation to dispense with or limit the authority of its board of directors only by a provision in its articles of incorporation; it does not permit a members’ agreement to effect such an arrangement, in contrast with G.S. 55-8-01(c) which permits a shareholders’ agreement to do so.

      Although the word “fiduciary” is no longer used in describing the duty owed by a director, there is no intent to change North Carolina law in this area. See North Carolina Commentary to G.S. 55-8-30.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Model Act counterpart of this section contains a provision in subsection (b) explicitly allowing reliance on ministers, priests and other religious authorities in the case of religious corporations. That provision was rejected as unnecessary because the subject is adequately covered by subdivision (b)(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) should not be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties prescribed by the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act in view of the Commentary to G.S. 36B-6, which states that the standard of care and prudence established by that section is generally comparable to that of a director of a business corporation rather than that of a private trustee; but in the event of any inconsistency, the provisions of the Uniform Act will control, as provided in G.S. 36B-8.

       President of a property owners association did not breach his fiduciary duty under the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, G.S. 55A-8-30, regarding the amendment of certain restrictive covenants, even though the president had a personal economic interest in the amendments, because the president disclosed his personal interest in the outcome of the amendment vote, G.S. 55A-8-31(a), and the property owners still voted to amend the covenants.

       Because none of the examples of breaching fiduciary duty suggested that a multiple lot owner and president of a property owners association was not acting in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances and in a manner the director reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, the president was entitled to summary judgment as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim.

      This section makes clear that the appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights in the officer. The removal of an officer with contract rights is without prejudice to his later enforcement of contract rights in a suit for damages for breach of contract. See the Official Comment to G.S. 55-8-43. Similarly, an officer with an employment contract who prematurely resigns may be in breach of his employment contract. The mere appointment of an officer for a term does not create a contractual obligation on his part to complete the term.

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if the director’s duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the director to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

      Subsection (a) of this section is the same as its counterpart in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> and is intended to reinforce the broad nonstatutory indemnification permitted by G.S. 55A-8-57.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of “corporation” in subdivision (b)(1) is intended to provide that only a surviving corporation in a statutory merger, and not an acquiring corporation in an asset acquisition, will have successor liability for indemnification. The surviving corporation in a statutory merger has both the obligation and the power to indemnify to the same extent as the merging corporation. G.S. 55-8-50(b)(1) was amended in 1993 to accomplish the same purposes. See N.C. Sess. Laws 1993, c. 552, s. 12.

      Subject to one exception, subsections (a) and (b) of this section are the same as subsections (a) and (c) of G.S. 55-8-57, based on the theory that the nonstatutory indemnification available to nonprofit corporations under this section should generally be no more restrictive than that available to business corporations. The single exception is that subsection (a) of this section, unlike its counterpart in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, prohibits a nonprofit corporation from indemnifying a person “if the person received an improper personal benefit”; the theory being that the nature of a nonprofit corporation makes this additional limitation appropriate. This section also does not contain a counterpart to subsection (b) of G.S. 55-8-57, on the theory that the conflict of interest provisions in G.S. 55A-8-31 should apply to all forms of nonstatutory indemnification under G.S. 55A-8-57, regardless of the nature or constituency of the nonprofit corporation and regardless of whether the indemnification is retroactive or prospective.

      Subdivision (b)(2) differs from former G.S. 55A-43 in that the transaction may generally be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast or by two-thirds of the votes cast, whichever is less. Subdivision (b)(3), by requiring written approval of the transaction by a third party if such approval is required for an amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to G.S. 55A-10-30, prevents the corporation from circumventing such a third party approval requirement by selling assets. This subdivision had no counterpart in the prior law. Subdivision (b)(3) and subsections (c) and (g) had no counterpart in the prior law. Subsection (g) is based on the Model Act and is designed to provide a measure of protection in sales of all or substantially all of the assets of a charitable or religious corporation.

      This section differs from prior law in that the plan of dissolution required by G.S. 55A-14-03 must be set forth in the articles of dissolution and in that articles of dissolution are the only required filing. A corporation is dissolved on the effective date of its articles of dissolution. There is no filing comparable to the certificate of dissolution issued by the Secretary of State under former G.S. 55A-49.
     </p>
     <p>
      Articles of dissolution may be filed under this section at any time after dissolution is authorized. Under former G.S. 55A-48, articles of dissolution were filed only after all debts, liabilities and obligations of the corporation had been paid, or adequate provision made therefor, and after all of the remaining property and assets of the corporation had been transferred.

      This Act does not bring forward the duty of the Attorney General under former G.S. 55A-51 to bring an action for involuntary dissolution under certain circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subdivision (a)(2) differs from prior law in the following respects: First, the requirement in former G.S. 55A-53(a)(1)a.
   that “irreparable injury to the corporation or to the public” be established when the directors are deadlocked was not brought forward. Second, the prior law did not expressly provide that deadlock of the members was grounds for involuntary dissolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirement in former G.S. 55A-53(b) that a creditor must show that the corporation is insolvent in order to be entitled to judicial dissolution was not brought forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even if there are grounds for dissolution under subsection (a), subsection (b) requires the court to consider other factors. Although former G.S. 55A-53(f), which permitted the court to grant relief other than dissolution, was not brought forward, the court has inherent power to grant such alternative relief under subsection (b). In addition, if dissolution is ordered and the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the dissolved corporation do not provide for the disposition of its assets, it is intended that the assets will be distributed or transferred as directed by the court. See former G.S. 55A-57(b) and (c).

       Printout cards or sheets of business records stored on electronic computing equipment are admissible in evidence, if otherwise relevant and material, if: (1) The computerized entries were made in the regular course of business, (2) the entries were made at or near the time of the transaction involved, and (3) a proper foundation for such evidence is laid by testimony of a witness who is familiar with the computerized records and the methods under which they were made so as to satisfy the court that the methods, the sources of information, and the time of preparation render such evidence trustworthy. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530, 1973 N.C. LEXIS 1028 (1973); State v. Stapleton, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C.

     <p>
      In certain respects, the inspection rights provided by this section are more limited than those set forth in former G.S. 55A-27, which provided inspection rights with respect to “all books and records.” However, unlike prior law, inspection rights are now granted with respect to the records of subsidiary corporations. For certain records, subsection (c) imposes conditions other than a “proper purpose,” which was the only requirement under the prior law.

      A nonprofit corporation is not required to have financial statements but, if it elects to have them, subsection [subdivision] (e)(5) generally requires them to be kept at the principal office and G.S. 55A-16-02(a) makes them available for inspection by members. However, in addition to its general right not to have any financial statements at all, a charitable or religious corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws that it will not furnish financial statements to its members. In that case, members will not have inspection rights with respect to the financial statements. See G.S. 55A-16-01(e)(5) and G.S. 55A-16-02(a).
