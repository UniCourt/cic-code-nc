                        Biological father’s substantive due process rights under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions were not violated because the father made very few efforts after the birth of the child to develop a parent-child relationship. As such, he did
                        not fall within the class of protected fathers who could claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with the child, his consent to the adoption of the child was not necessary, and the adoption chapter was not unconstitutional

                        Under this Chapter as it formerly stood, it was held that since the laws of inheritance and distribution of property are directly involved in an adoption proceeding, and since the proceeding is in derogation of the common law, it must be strictly construed.

                        Since the adoption statute is in derogation of the common law and works a change in the canons of descent, it must be construed strictly and not so as to enlarge or confer any rights not clearly given. Crumpton v. Crumpton,

                        The right of adoption is not only beneficial to those immediately concerned, but likewise to the public, and construction of the statute should not be narrow or technical, but rather fair and reasonable, where all material provisions of the statute have

                            Under former G.S. 48-6, it was held that adoption proceedings are conclusive as to persons who were parties thereto and as to their privies, notwithstanding a defect as to a party who would be entitled to disregard them as not binding on him, but who
                            does not complain of his nonjoinder. Locke v. Merrick, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 799</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 523, 1944 N.C. LEXIS 273 (1944). See G.S. 48-28 .

                            Adoption decree was invalid because the non-parent was seeking relief that was unavailable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as she
                            sought an adoption decree that would establish the legal relationship of parent and child with the minor child but not sever that same relationship between the minor child and his biological mother under G.S. 48-1-106(c) and
                            G.S. 48-3-606(9), and therefore the adoption petition did not invoke the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction under G.S. 48-2-100; as a result, the adoption decree was void ab initio. Boseman v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 537</cite>,

                            Severance of legal ties with the child’s natural family was not intended to be partial; rather, former G.S. 48-6 means that upon a final order of adoption the severance of legal ties with the child’s natural family is total. The child acquires full status
                            as a member of his adoptive family and in so doing is for all legal purposes removed from his natural bloodline. Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1, 1981

                            In enacting former G.S. 48-6, the legislature contemplated that upon a final order of adoption a complete substitution of family would take place, with the adopted child becoming the child of his adoptive parents and a member of their family, and the
                            legal relationship with the child’s natural parents and family being by virtue of the adoption order completely severed; therefore, those adopted out of a family may not take as “issue” of that family under a deed granting

                            A final decree of adoption for life terminates the relationship between the natural parents and the child, and the natural parents are divested of all rights with respect to the child.

                            Under former G.S. 48-6, as it stood prior to the 1941 amendment, the effect of adoption was simply to create a personal status between the adoptive parent and the child adopted, so that the adopted child might inherit from the adoptive parent such estate
                            of the adoptive parent as such parent, during his lifetime, might voluntarily have given to such child. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 438</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 604, 1947 N.C. LEXIS

                            Under former G.S. 48-6, as it stood prior to the 1941 amendment, the adopted child could not inherit through the adoptive parent or from any source other than the “estate of the petitioner.” The right to inherit was limited to the property of the adoptive
                            parent, and the adopted child could not inherit from his father’s ancestors or other kindred or be a representative of them. Grimes v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 778</cite>, 178 S.E.

                            Any provision of law which prevented an adopted child from sharing in property by descent or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as a natural born child was swept away by the repealing clause in Session Laws 1955, c. 813. Headen v.

                            Former G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) does not abolish the rule that the intent of the testator controls the construction of his will. Peele v. Finch, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 375</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 635, 1973

                            It is well established that the cardinal principle in the construction of a will is to give effect to the intent of the testator as it appears from the language used in the instrument itself, subject to the limits imposed by statute or decision. Former
                            G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) had not changed this principle, but has merely provided the courts with a clear and certain rule of construction to be applied unless a contrary intent plainly appears from the terms of
                            the instrument. Stoney v. MacDougall, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 230 S.E.2d 592, <cite class="nc_code">1976 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2085 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 716</cite>,

                            Where a trust provided benefits for named blood relatives of testator, with provision that this number could be increased only in the event that great nieces and great nephews were born within 21 years after testator’s death, the will clearly indicated
                            testator’s intent to exclude children adopted by his nieces and nephews from the benefits, and therefore this section, by its express language, did not apply, and the children adopted by testator’s nieces and nephews would
                            not take under the will. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 531</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 182, 1965 N.C. LEXIS 1230 (1965).

                            Where a parent by adoption was named a legatee in the will of her mother, but died prior to the death of her mother, the adopted child would take the personalty bequeathed his mother by adoption, even though the adoption was subsequent to the execution

                        an adoption decree that would establish the legal relationship of parent and child with the minor child but not sever that same relationship between the minor child and his biological mother under G.S. 48-1-106(c) and G.S. 48-3-606(9),

                        The trial court erred in placing child with petitioners for the purpose of adoption, since adoptions are permitted only upon the statutory procedure set out in this Chapter, by a special proceeding before the clerk of the superior court; moreover, there
                        was no evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the department of social services, which had custody of the child, “wrongfully and unreasonably withheld its consent for adoption.” In re Sloop,

                        Because the legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care, because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care, and because the superior
                        court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court’s jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin,

                            class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 238 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the interlocutory
                        decree is vacated, the adoption petition is dismissed or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 238 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care for the child and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court’s jurisdiction supersedes that of the district
                        court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding; therefore, upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district
                        court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the adoption petition is dismissed or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 238 (1995).

                    <p>
                        When legal and physical custody of minor child vested in the Department of Social Services (DSS), it was then authorized to proceed in its discretion with placing child for adoption, and the trial court had no authority to interfere with the DSS’s placement
                        decision. In re Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 479 S.E.2d 229, <cite class="nc_code">1997 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 19 (1997).

                        In a case in which the mother of a child and the child’s paternal relatives appealed a district court’s dismissal of their motion to overturn the district court’s adoption order, the district court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction because the
                        mother and the relatives filed a motion for appropriate relief based on G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3) and G.S. 15A-1443, which were sections of the Criminal Procedure Act. Though it appeared that the mother could have moved the trial court
                        to void the adoption decree pursuant to G.S. 48-2-607(b) based on her claim of duress, she failed to do so. In re W.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 685 S.E.2d 151, <cite class="nc_code">2009 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 1728 (2009).

                        In a case arising under this Chapter before the 1949 revision, the evidence disclosed that the child in question was brought by its mother into the juvenile court of the county of their residence charged with being a dependent child, that the court committed
                        it to the custody of a children’s home society having its home office in another county of the State, but that the child was immediately taken by the person seeking to adopt it to that person’s residence in another state. It was
                        held that the child never resided in the county in which was located the home office of the children’s home society, its mere commitment to the children’s home not having had the effect of making the child’s constructive residence
                        there, and that adoption proceedings in that county were thus void, since the child was never within its jurisdiction. In re Holder, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 136</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 620, 1940 N.C. LEXIS

                <p>
                    A final adoption decree issued by any other state must be recognized in this State. Where a minor child has been previously adopted in a foreign country by a petitioner or petitioners seeking to readopt the child under the laws of North Carolina, the
                    adoption order entered in the foreign country may be accepted in lieu of the consent of the biological parent or parents or the guardian of the child to the readoption. A man and a woman who adopted a minor child in a foreign country
                    while married to one another must readopt jointly, regardless of whether they have since divorced. If either does not join in the petition, he or she must be joined as a necessary party as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 19. If a man and
                    a woman have adopted a minor child in a foreign country while married to one another and one of them has died, then the survivor may petition for readoption, and the court shall issue any decree of adoption in the names of both of
                    the man and the woman who adopted the minor child in a foreign country.

                        Court did not err in deeming it likely that the grandparents would adopt the child, and it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the child’s best interests would be served by terminating the mother’s parental rights because the grandparents
                        did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child’s grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt him; by all accounts, the child
                        was thriving in the grandparents’ home; and the child’s guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother’s and the father’s parental rights in order to facilitate the child’s adoption by the grandparents. In re D.E.M.,

                        Earlier decision setting aside termination order did not “void” basis of subsequent adoption proceeding or earlier termination proceeding, but simply held that termination order must be set aside since the service on putative father was void. In re Clark,

                        Nothing the mother did or failed to do placed the biological father in a position in which “qualification for notice” of the existence of the child was “beyond [his] control” during the relevant statutory time frame; thus, the father had the opportunity
                        to be on notice of the pregnancy and he failed to grasp that opportunity by taking any of the steps that would establish him as a responsible father. Because of his passivity in the face of ample evidence that the mother may have
                        become pregnant with his child and given birth, the father did not fall into the class of protected fathers who may claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with a child, and thus he was not deprived of due process.

        Department of Social Services Has Duty to Make Investigations. —

                    <p>
                        Under former G.S. 48-16(a), the legislature clearly vested the Department of Social Services with the duty and responsibility to make investigations regarding adoptions; thus, absent any responsibilities or duties to perform, the guardian ad litem is
                        superfluous to an adoption proceeding. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430, <cite class="nc_code">1987 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2700 (1987).

                        Because an adoption action was still pending with the clerk of the superior court, and a maternal grandmother contested the adoptions of her grandchildren by paternal grandparents, the clerk was required to transfer the adoption proceedings to the district
                        court for adjudication under G.S. 48-2-601(a1); the case was remanded to the clerk of superior court to determine whether the adoption action was still contested, and if so, to transfer the adoption proceedings to district court
                        for a hearing under G.S. 48-2-603 to determine whether adoption by paternal grandparents was in the best interests of the children. Norris v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 692 S.E.2d

                        Father’s request to set aside a clerk’s order finding that his consent was not necessary for the adoption of his child was a request for equitable relief and was properly transferred to the district court pursuant to G.S. 1-301.2(b), giving the district
                        court jurisdiction to address the father’s motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) because the clerk’s decision was not final. In re Fisher,

                        does not mention the best interest of the child, G.S. 48-2-501(a), 48-2-603(a), and 48-2-606(a)(7) require that the court consider a child’s best interest when considering adoptive placement for the child. In re Papathanassiou,

                        Because an adoption action was still pending with the clerk of the superior court, and a maternal grandmother contested the adoptions of her grandchildren by paternal grandparents, the clerk was required to transfer the adoption proceedings to the district
                        court for adjudication under G.S. 48-2-601(a1); the case was remanded to the clerk of superior court to determine whether the adoption action was still contested, and if so, to transfer the adoption proceedings to district court
                        for a hearing under G.S. 48-2-603 to determine whether adoption by paternal grandparents was in the best interests of the children. Norris v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 692 S.E.2d

                        The withdrawal of one petitioner from the adoption petition does not, in and of itself, require dismissal of the proceedings. The withdrawal, however, is a factor to be considered in determining the best interests of the child. The question of the child’s
                        best interests should be paramount in the court’s consideration of a motion to dismiss the proceedings. In re Kasim, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 293 S.E.2d 247, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2757 (1982).

                        Former G.S. 48-26 clearly prohibits any direct or collateral attack in adoption proceedings except by a biological parent or guardian of the child. It makes no provision for attack by the child, and nothing in the section requires that the child have

                        In a case in which the mother of a child and the child’s paternal relatives appealed a district court’s dismissal of their motion to overturn the district court’s adoption order, the district court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction because the
                        mother and the relatives filed a motion for appropriate relief based on G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3) and G.S. 15A-1443, which were sections of the Criminal Procedure Act. Though it appeared that the mother could have moved the trial court

                        District court erred in declaring that a superior court clerk’s orders setting aside adoption decrees allowing paternal grandparents to legally adopt their grandchildren were void and that the adoption decrees remained valid because the district court
                        did not obtain jurisdiction to review the clerk’s orders pursuant to an appeal under G.S. 48-2-607(b) when the grandparents did not appeal the clerk’s orders setting aside the adoption decrees; since the grandparents did not appeal
                        the clerk’s orders, they remained in effect under G.S. 1-301.2(e), and the orders were interlocutory and not appealable pursuant to G.S. 1-301.2(e). Norris v.

                        court jurisdiction to address the father’s motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) and G.S. 48-2-607(b). In re Fisher,

                        Under former G.S. 48-9.1, the county department of social services or child placing agency to which a child had been surrendered by his parents retained legal custody of the child until the occurrence of one of the events specified therein, and legal

                        Action to obtain custody of a child placed in plaintiffs’ home pursuant to a foster parent agreement was governed by former G.S. 48-9.1 and not by G.S. 7A-289.33 [see now G.S. 7B-1112]. Section 7A-289.33 [see now G.S. 7B-1112] sets forth the effects of
                        a court order terminating the parental rights of a natural parent on grounds of abuse or neglect, and such a court order was not involved where the natural parents had voluntarily released their parental rights and surrendered

                    <p>
                        Since the welfare of the child is the controlling factor in an adoption proceeding, any agreement between foster parents and a department of social services concerning the adoption of a child who is placed in a home for foster care is subject to the court’s
                        independent judgment as to what is in the best interest of the child; consequently, in a child custody suit, defendant department of social services could not seek to deprive plaintiffs, as foster parents, of standing to challenge
                        the reasonableness of defendant’s denial of plaintiffs’ request to adopt the minor child placed in their home. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>,

                        to be on notice of the pregnancy and he failed to grasp that opportunity by taking any of the steps that would establish him as a responsible father. Because of his passivity in the face of ample evidence that the mother may have
                        become pregnant with his child and given birth, the father did not fall into the class of protected fathers who may claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with a child, and thus he was not deprived of due process.

                        Where proceeding for adoption of a child born out of wedlock was instituted in conformity with former G.S. 48-6 upon the written consent of its mother, but its mother and reputed father married prior to an order of reference directing the superintendent
                        of public welfare (now director of social services) of the county to make a full investigation to determine if the child was a proper child for adoption, and the natural parents intervened and moved to vacate and dismiss the proceeding,
                        it was held that at the time of the reference and at the time the court came to determine whether the child was the proper subject for adoption the status of the child had changed from illegitimate to legitimate, and the motion
                        of the interveners to vacate the proceeding and for the custody of their child should have been allowed, it being required in a proceeding for the adoption of a legitimate child that its natural parents be parties or their consent
                        to the adoption be made to appear unless they have abandoned the child. In re Jane Doe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 1</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 8, 1949 N.C. LEXIS 475 (1949).

                        Since the welfare of the child is the controlling factor in an adoption proceeding, any agreement between foster parents and a department of social services concerning the adoption of a child who is placed in a home for foster care is subject to the court’s
                        independent judgment as to what is in the best interest of the child; consequently, in a child custody suit, defendant department of social services could not seek to deprive plaintiffs, as foster parents, of standing to challenge
                        the reasonableness of defendant’s denial of plaintiffs’ request to adopt the minor child placed in their home. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>,

                        Putative father’s consent to the adoption of his minor child was not required, pursuant to G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4)(II), as the father’s mere offers of support were insufficient under the statute to require the consent of the father to the adoption. Despite
                        possessing adequate wherewithal, the father, a teenager who had obtained employment, never provided any actual financial payments to the mother, much less the reasonable and consistent payments required under the subsection. In

                        In an adoption case, the consent of a biological father was not required because the father did not provide reasonable and consistent payments of support under this section commensurate with his ability to provide such payments; actual, real, and tangible
                        support was required, and attempts or offers did not suffice. Robinson v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 767 S.E.2d 395, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1336 (2014).

                        Although a putative father testified that he saved money as the father could over time by placing money in a lockbox in the father’s room, the father’s evidence failed to demonstrate through an objectively verifiable record that the father made the statutorily

                    the court shall order the guardian ad litem of the parent to execute for that parent a consent as provided in this Part or a relinquishment as provided in Part 7 of this Article.

                        Where there was evidence in behalf of defendant father tending to show that plaintiff took possession of his children against his will and prevented him from performing his parental duty, as well as evidence to the contrary, it was held that when the

                        Willfulness is as much an element of abandonment within the meaning of this section as it is of the crime of abandonment described in G.S. 14-322 and former G.S. 14-326. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>, 91

                        To constitute abandonment by a parent of his child, so as to deprive him of the right to prevent the adoption of the child, there must be some conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a purpose to forego his parental duties. Truelove v. Parker,

                        The fact that a parent commits a crime which might result in incarceration is insufficient, standing alone, to show a settled purpose to forego all parental duties. In re Maynor, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 248

                        The fact that respondent committed the felony of crime against nature, was found guilty and was incarcerated did not evince a willful intent on his part to forego any responsibility to his child.

                        payments to support the child, the fact that respondent was unable to locate his son and was unable to make support payments as a result of his incarceration was inconsistent with a willful intent to abandon his son. In re Maynor,

                        The act of adoptive parents of child in entering into contract consenting to its adoption by another couple does not constitute constructive abandonment of the child so as to obviate the necessity of their consent to its adoption by such other couple.

                        Prior to October 1, 1985, two procedures were available to enable a petitioning party to adopt a minor child without the consent of the opposing biological parent. First, under G.S. 7A-289.32 [see now G.S. 7B-1111], a court could terminate the parental
                        rights of a biological parent upon a finding of one of the grounds enumerated therein, and then, pursuant to this section, once a district court had entered an order terminating the parental rights of a biological parent, that
                        parent was no longer a necessary party to an adoption proceeding. Second, the court, under subsection (d) of this section, upon proper motion, was authorized to hold a hearing to determine whether an abandonment as defined in former
                        G.S. 48-2(1)a and (1)b had taken place. However, effective October 1, 1985, these proceedings were merged into one termination of parental rights proceeding under G.S. 7A-289.32(8) [see now G.S. 7B-1111(a)(7)] to ascertain whether
                        the parent had willfully abandoned the child for at least six consecutive months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d

                        Father’s request to set aside a clerk’s order finding that his consent was not necessary for the adoption of his child was a request for equitable relief and was properly transferred to the district court pursuant to G.S. 1-301.2(b), giving the district
                        court jurisdiction to address the father’s motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) because the clerk’s decision was not final. In re Fisher,

                    <p>
                        Court of Appeals of North Carolina holds that G.S. 48-3-605 requires (1) that an original or copy of a signed consent to adoption be provided to the biological parent who has signed the document and (2) that the time period allowed by G.S. 48-3-608 for
                        revocation does not begin to run until the requirements of G.S. 48-3-605 have been met. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 109 (2018).

                        holds that the time for revocation under G.S. 48-3-608(a) does not begin to run until an original or copy of the signed consent is actually delivered to the consenting parent consistent with the provisions and purposes of G.S.

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in concluding that a mother’s revocation was timely where the mother received a copy of her signed consent on a particular date, and she had submitted a notice of revocation within seven days of that date. In re Ivey,

                    <p>
                        Construing the language of G.S. 48-3-605 in pari materia with the revocation requirements in G.S. 48-3-608, the content requirements of G.S. 48-3-606, and the underlying purposes of the adoption regime set forth in G.S. 48-1-100 demonstrates the intent
                        of the legislature that a biological parent consenting to adoption receive, as a matter of fact, an original or copy of the signed consent in order for it to be effectuated.

                        Trial court’s finding that a mother did not, as a matter of fact, receive an original or copy of the consent of adoption at the time it was signed did not contradict the certification by the notary where it was entirely possible that: (1) the notary believed

                        erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order’s terms did not meet statutory requirements

                        The purpose of former G.S. 48-11 was obvious: to give stability to the adoptive process. It allows prospective adoptive parents, as well as the child, to settle into a stable home environment, to be disturbed only upon those occasions when, prior to the
                        final order, county directors of social services or adoptive agencies conduct studies of the provisions being made for the child. It also gives the natural parents a period of intense review of their decision to allow the adoption.

                        Letter mailed by natural mother to one of the petitioners, stating that she was withdrawing her consent to child’s adoption, constituted sufficient notice of revocation under the law as it stood prior to Oct. 1, 1983, the effective date of subsection
                        (b) of former G.S. 48-11, and was timely made inasmuch as less than three months (now 30 days) had elapsed since execution of the consent to adopt and no interlocutory or final order of adoption had been entered. In re Terry,

                        A consent to the adoption of any infant who is in utero or any minor may be revoked within seven days following the day on which it is executed, inclusive of weekends and holidays. If the final day of the revocation period falls on a Saturday, Sunday,
                        or a legal holiday when North Carolina courthouses are closed for transactions, then the revocation period extends to the next business day. The individual who gave the consent may revoke by giving written notice to the person
                        specified in the consent. Notice may be given by personal delivery, overnight delivery service, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. If notice is given by mail, notice is deemed complete when it is deposited

                        Construing the language of G.S. 48-3-605 in pari materia with the revocation requirements in G.S. 48-3-608, the content requirements of G.S. 48-3-606, and the underlying purposes of the adoption regime set forth in G.S. 48-1-100 demonstrates the intent
                        of the legislature that a biological parent consenting to adoption receive, as a matter of fact, an original or copy of the signed consent in order for it to be effectuated. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite>                        622, 810 S.E.2d 740, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 109 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Court of Appeals of North Carolina holds that G.S. 48-3-605 requires (1) that an original or copy of a signed consent to adoption be provided to the biological parent who has signed the document and (2) that the time period allowed by G.S. 48-3-608 for
                        revocation does not begin to run until the requirements of G.S. 48-3-605 have been met. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 109 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Keeping in mind the plain language of G.S. 48-1-100, 48-3-605, and 48-3-608, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina rejects a reading of the relevant statutes that would lead to a result contrary to the legislature’s intent. Rather, the Court of Appeals
                        holds that the time for revocation under G.S. 48-3-608(a) does not begin to run until an original or copy of the signed consent is actually delivered to the consenting parent consistent with the provisions and purposes of G.S.

                        Terminating a father’s parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was filed, as the father sought the children’s custody
                        during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children’s custody to others, terminating the father’s child support obligation, denying the father visitation, and purporting to waive any objection to termination,
                        erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process, and the order’s terms did not meet statutory requirements

                    In addition to the mandatory provisions listed in G.S. 48-3-703, a relinquishment may also state that the relinquishment may be revoked upon notice by the agency that an adoption by a specific prospective adoptive parent, named or described in the relinquishment
                    is not completed. In this event the parent’s time to revoke a relinquishment is 10 days, inclusive of weekends and holidays, from the date the parent receives such notice from the agency. The revocation shall be in writing and delivered
                    in a manner specified in G.S. 48-3-706(a) for revocation of relinquishments. An agency, which after the exercise of due diligence cannot personally locate the parent entitled to this notice, may deposit a copy of the notice in the
                    United States mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the address of the parent given in the relinquishment, and the date of receipt by the parent is deemed to be the date of delivery or last attempted delivery. If a parent does
                    not revoke the relinquishment in the time and manner provided in this section, the relinquishment is deemed a general relinquishment to the agency, and the agency may place the child for adoption with a prospective adoptive parent
                    selected by the agency.

        Biological Parent Need Not Join in Spouse’s Petition for Adoption of Her Children. —

                        G.S. 29-17(e) and subsection (d) of former G.S. 48-7 were enacted, not to retain adopted children’s status as “lineal descendants” by the former marriage, but instead to provide that the parent-child relationship between adopted children and their biological
                        parent is not severed by the parent’s spouse’s adoption of her children from a former marriage. Since the relationship remains intact in this limited situation, it is not necessary for such a biological parent to become a co-petitioner
                        in her husband’s adoption of her legitimate children of a former marriage. This biological parent, however, must consent to the adoption, as must any biological parent who does not come within the ambit of G.S. 48-6. In re Estate
                        of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2414 (1986).

                        Wife’s failure to “join” in her husband’s petition for the adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband’s distributive share under

                        Requirement that adoption records be sealed reflects legislative recognition of potential harm to adopted children and their adoptive families, and ultimately to society, which may arise from unwarranted revelation of private facts about adoptions, and
                        suggests that the circumstances surrounding a particular adoption and the identities of the parties involved are ordinarily not matters of public interest. Hall v.

                        to aid plaintiff and her deceased husband in adopting their first child, and the files most likely contained duplicates of many of the papers protected by former G.S. 48-24, 48-25 and 48-26. Sheppard v. Sheppard,

                        Actions of adopting parents and their attorney in making funds available for the purpose of bringing a biological mother into the State so as to facilitate the adoption of her unborn child, including supporting her and the child through the date of birth
                        and returning the mother to her home state, constituted a violation of this section. In re P.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 692</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 505, 1991 N.C. LEXIS 610 (1991).

                        Where the trial court concluded that mother was equitably estopped from collecting the child support arrearages and the sole basis for the estoppel was that the mother had promised she would “not pursue the action for child support arrears” in exchange
                        for the father’s consent to adoption, the agreement violated this section in that both the mother and the father gave and received consideration for the placement of the child for adoption. Thus the agreement was void as being
                        contrary to the public policy and could not be used in equity to estop the mother from enforcing her judgment for the full amount of the child support arrearages.

                        Father’s agreement to consent to the adoption of his child violated G.S. 48-37 and was void as contrary to public policy, in that it was in exchange for the termination of his child support obligations and the mother’s agreement not to pursue child support,
                        either prospective or in arrears; therefore, the consent agreement cannot be used to estop DSS from reopening the child support case and seeking reimbursement for the public assistance paid subsequent to the consent order. Stanly

                        Actions of adopting parents and their attorney in making funds available for the purpose of bringing a biological mother into the State so as to facilitate the adoption of her unborn child, including supporting her and the child through the date of birth
                        and returning the mother to her home state, constituted a violation of former G.S. 48-25. In re P.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 692</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 505, 1991 N.C. LEXIS 610 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Where the trial court concluded that mother was equitably estopped from collecting the child support arrearages and the sole basis for the estoppel was that the mother had promised she would “not pursue the action for child support arrears” in exchange
                        for the father’s consent to adoption, the agreement violated this section in that both the mother and the father gave and received consideration for the placement of the child for adoption. Thus the agreement was void as being
                        contrary to the public policy and could not be used in equity to estop the mother from enforcing her judgment for the full amount of the child support arrearages.

        Arrangement by Prospective Adoptive Parents to Pay Transportation Expenses and Medical Costs for Expectant Mother. —
       </b> Under former G.S. 48-37 as it read prior to the 1991 amendment, prospective adoptive parents who entered into an arrangement with an expectant mother to pay her transportation expenses to North Carolina as well as all
                        medical costs incident to the birth of the child pursuant to an independent adoption placement violated the provisions of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Renee P. Hill, 45 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 24 (1975).
