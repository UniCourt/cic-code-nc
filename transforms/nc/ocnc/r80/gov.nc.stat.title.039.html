      When real estate is conveyed to any person, the same shall be held and construed to be a conveyance in fee, whether the word “heir” is used or not, unless such conveyance in plain and express words shows, or it is plainly intended by the conveyance or some part thereof, that the grantor meant to convey an estate of less dignity.

       <p>
        This section changes the common-law rule
   
   that in order to convey a fee simple the word “heirs” should appear either in the premises or the habendum of the deed. Carolina Real Estate Co. v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 225</cite>, 67 S.E. 483, 1910 N.C. LEXIS 247 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule of construction in this section prevails over common-law rules
   
   to the extent that they conflict. Robinson v. King, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 314 S.E.2d 768, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3209 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even prior to the enactment of the section
   
   the courts of this State commenced to draw away from the strictness of the common-law rule in this respect, and a perusal of a large number of cases bearing upon and controlling the subject show a marked tendency to mitigate the harshness of the law. So an exception as to devises and equitable estates had already been made. Hollowell v. Manly, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 262</cite>, 102 S.E. 386, 1920 N.C. LEXIS 219 (1920); Whichard v. Whitehurst, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 79</cite>, 106 S.E. 463, 1921 N.C. LEXIS 22 (1921); Smith v. Proctor, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 314</cite>, 51 S.E. 889, 1905 N.C. LEXIS 129 (1905).

         Deeds Executed Prior to Effective Force of Section. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a deed to lands executed and delivered prior to the effective force of this section would not pass an estate in fee simple if the deed entirely omitted the word “heirs” or other appropriate words of inheritance, a deed executed before such date to a school committee “and their successors in office in fee simple” was sufficient to pass a fee simple title of the lands conveyed therein. Tucker v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 502</cite>, 154 S.E. 826, 1930 N.C. LEXIS 162 (1930).

        This section provides the same rule of construction of deeds as is contained in G.S. 31-38 for construction of devises. Vickers v. Leigh, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 248</cite>, 10 S.E. 308, 1889 N.C. LEXIS 188 (1889).

       <p>
        Decisions construing G.S. 31-38, pertaining to the construction of wills, are pertinent in construing this section, since the statutes are similar in wording and effect. Artis v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 754</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 228, 1948 N.C. LEXIS 397 (1948).

         Fee Simple Presumed Unless Contrary Intention Appears. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        All conveyances of land executed since the passage of this section are to be taken to be in fee simple, unless the intent of the grantor is plainly manifest in some part of the instrument to convey an estate of less dignity. It is the legislative will that the intention of the grantor and not the technical words of the common law shall govern. Triplett v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 394</cite>, 63 S.E. 79, 1908 N.C. LEXIS 363 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        By this section a deed, though not using the word “heirs,” is a conveyance in fee, unless the contrary intention appears. Holloway v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 91</cite>, 83 S.E. 243, 1914 N.C. LEXIS 61 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law favors creation of a fee simple estate unless it is clearly shown a lesser estate was intended. Vestal v. Vestal, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 263, 271 S.E.2d 306, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3369 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        If it appeared that the word “heirs” was omitted because of ignorance, inadvertence or mistake,
   
   the word would be supplied so as to pass title in fee in accordance with the intention of the grantor. Vickers v. Leigh, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 248</cite>, 10 S.E. 308, 1889 N.C. LEXIS 188 (1889).

       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption of fee raised by this section was rebutted by the fact that the deed intended to convey only a life estate, which was manifest from the many restraining expressions contained therein. Boomer v. Grantham, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 230</cite>, 165 S.E. 698, 1932 N.C. LEXIS 360 (1932).

        Under this section, the absence of words of inheritance, such as the use of the word “heir,” combined with the presence of language limiting the estate to the term of the grantee’s life, should be interpreted to convey a life estate. Robinson v. King, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 314 S.E.2d 768, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3209 (1984).

       <p>
        The law does not favor a construction of the language contained in a deed which would constitute a condition subsequent unless the intention of the parties to create such a restriction upon the title is clearly manifested. Mattox v. State, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 471</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 378, 1972 N.C. LEXIS 1266 (1972).

         Conflict Between Granting Clause and Habendum. —

       <p>
        Where a quitclaim deed was ambiguous in that the granting clause gave all right, title, and interest to the grantee, while the habendum clause gave her the land “for and during the term of her natural life,” the trial court properly held that the grantee acquired only a life estate under the deed. Robinson v. King, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 314 S.E.2d 768, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3209 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The granting clause of a deed was to one of the grantor’s sons, his heirs and assigns, and following the description, “this deed is conveyed to the said grantee to him his lifetime and then to his boy children,” with habendum to the said son “and his heirs and not to assign only to his brothers their only use and behoof forever” with warranty to the said son “and his heirs and assigns.” It was held that the portion of the habendum restraining assignment except to the brothers of the grantee was equally consistent with an assignment of a life estate and with an assignment of the fee, and to hold that the grant to the “son and his heirs” conveyed the fee simple would require that other portions of the instrument expressive of the intent of the grantor be disregarded; thus in accordance with the intention of the grantor as gathered from the entire instrument the deed conveyed a life estate to the son with remainder to the son’s male children, the intent of the grantor to convey an estate of less dignity than a fee being apparent. Jefferson v. Jefferson, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 333</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 745, 1941 N.C. LEXIS 319 (1941).

       <p>
        The premises of a deed to land read, among other things, “unto said M.G., her heirs and assigns,” and the habendum, “to herself, the said M.G. during her lifetime, and at her death said land is to be equally divided between” her children. It was held that since under this section, the same estate would have passed if the word “heirs,” an established formula, had been omitted in the granting clause, there was no repugnance in this deed between the granting clause and habendum. The limitation of the estate in the habendum, and the creation of an estate in remainder therein, were conclusive proof that there was no intention of the grantor to create an estate in fee, but an estate for life to M.G. with a remainder over to her children.

       <p>
        Where the granting clause and the habendum convey the entire estate in fee simple, and the warranty is in harmony therewith, a clause in any other part of the instrument which undertakes to divest or limit the fee simple title will be rejected as repugnant to the estate and interest conveyed. Artis v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 754</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 228, 1948 N.C. LEXIS 397 (1948); Pilley v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 62</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 923, 1949 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the granting clause in a deed purported to convey the fee and the habendum and warranties were in harmony therewith, a clause in the description referring to the property conveyed as a right-of-way 100 feet wide did not limit the conveyance to an easement, and the contention that a fee simple was conveyed was supported by this section. McCotter v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 480</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 330, 1958 N.C. LEXIS 560 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the granting clause, the habendum, and the warranty in a deed are clear and unambiguous, and fully sufficient to pass immediately a fee simple estate to the grantee or grantees, a paragraph inserted between the description and the habendum in which grantor seeks to reserve a life estate in himself or another, or to otherwise limit the estate conveyed, will be rejected as repugnant to the estate and interest therein conveyed. Lackey v. Hamlet City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 460</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 806, 1963 N.C. LEXIS 420 (1963).

        Where a reverter clause and purposes for which property was to be held as expressed in the habendum
   
   were not irreconcilable with or repugnant to the granting clause, a fee simple determinable was conveyed, it being apparent that the grantors intended to convey an estate of less dignity than a fee simple absolute.

       When the legislature passed this section, it was their primary intention to abolish past rules of construction which required courts to disregard certain clauses if they contradicted the granting clause of a deed.

       In light of the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, the statute’s requirement that “the courts” interpret the deed did not change the traditional rule that it is the judge’s role to determine the intent of the parties. It was not the legislature’s intent to change

Intention, as a general rule, must be sought in the terms of the instrument; but if the words used leave the intention in doubt, resort may be had to the circumstances attending the execution of the instrument and the situation of the parties at that time; the tendency of the modern decisions is to treat all uncertainties in a conveyance as ambiguities to be explained by ascertaining, in the manner indicated the intention of the parties; where trial judge chose not to hear evidence of “circumstances attending the execution of the instrument and the situation of the parties at that time,” and instead, reasoned that he was able to determine the intent of the parties by considering the entire deed, summary judgment was proper.

       Where the cause of action is in fraud, the defendants would have a basic right to a jury trial. However, judge in action to quiet title based on fraud and on construction of deed considered only the intent of the parties in the deed in question and did not reach the issue of fraud. Once the intent was determined from the four corners of the deed, “fraud” no longer mattered and no jury trial was necessary. The judge was able to dispose of the case on a judgment on the pleadings.

       Even though the statutory power of revocation of a voluntary conveyance of future interests in lands limited to persons not in esse be regarded as a vested right, the 1943 amendment to this section, giving the grantor six months after its effective date to exercise the right of revocation or to file notice of intention to do so, is a reasonable limitation, and therefore the application of the limitation of the amendment to deeds executed prior to its effective date is constitutional.

      </p>
      <p>
       The 1943 amendment was no doubt enacted to resolve a doubtful situation which had arisen through uncertainty as to the effect of this section on the revocability of trusts, and the incidence of federal taxation on trusts already set up, or hereafter to be created. It was intended to bring North Carolina into line with other states where the irrevocability of trusts could be assured to the grantor or settlor when made. Pinkham v. Unborn Children of Pinkham, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 72</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 690, 1946 N.C. LEXIS 369 (1946).

       Though vested rights may not be affected by retroactive laws, contingent interests may be affected thereby, and where there is a voluntary trust with the limitation over upon a contingency determinable at some future time as to the persons who take thereunder, the power of revocation of a trust given by this section is not within the constitutional inhibition.

        Unless the formalities of this section are complied with, the deed is absolutely void. Jackson v. Beard, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 105</cite>, 78 S.E. 6, 1913 N.C. LEXIS 319 (1913).

       <p>
        Compliance with the statutory requirement in effect at the time the deed was executed was necessary
   
   to its validity. Failure to comply with the requirements rendered the deed of a married woman to her husband absolutely void. Noble v. Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 601</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 89, 1955 N.C. LEXIS 422 (1955).

        The section admits no distinction between legal and equitable interests,

Paquin, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 83</cite>, 52 S.E. 410 (1905), says: “For the purpose of throwing around her the protection of her husband’s counsel and advice, the legislature declared that with certain exceptions she could not contract without the written consent of her husband.” Jackson v.

The fact that the General Assembly saw fit to change the statute requiring proof as to the husband and wife to be taken before the same officer, and that proof as to the husband should precede proof as to the wife, after the decisions of McGlennery v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 215</cite> (1884), and Ferguson v.

Hunter, furnishes the strongest possible evidence that the General Assembly thought the latter a safeguard which ought to be retained. Graves v.

       In an action to invalidate a deed to lands because, in fact, the privy examination of the feme covert, the owner and plaintiff, had not been taken, though it was expressed to have been taken, as required in the certificate of the justice of the peace (now magistrate) the plaintiff may by clear, cogent, and convincing proof show that her examination had not been taken at all, and when, under a proper charge thereon from the judge, the jury has found that such examination was not taken, the verdict will stand, though the grantee may not have been fixed with notice.

       Where a married woman has signed a mortgage or deed of trust to secure borrowed money, she may not have it set aside upon allegation of fraud of a probate officer in taking her separate examination, when she admits that the examination was taken in substantial compliance with the requirement of the statute, and she signed the conveyance, and there is no evidence that the mortgagee participated in the fraud.

      Every competent married person of lawful age is authorized to execute, without the joinder of his or her spouse, instruments creating powers of attorney affecting the real and personal property of such married person naming either third parties or, subject to the provisions of G.S. 52-10 or 52-10.1, his or her spouse as attorney-in-fact. When such a married person executes a power of attorney authorized by the preceding sentence naming his or her spouse as attorney in fact the acknowledgment by the spouse of the grantor is not necessary. Such instruments may confer upon the attorney, and the attorney may exercise, any and all powers which lawfully can be conferred upon an attorney-in-fact, including, but not limited to, the authority to join in conveyances of real property for the purpose of waiving or quitclaiming any rights which may be acquired as a surviving spouse under the provisions of G.S. 29-30.

      <p>
       The plain language of subsection (a) of this section purports to cure deeds which are void because of failure to conduct a private examination of the wife. Subsection (a) does not purport to cure, and does not in fact cure, deeds which are void because the certifying officer taking the acknowledgment of the wife failed to state in his certificate his findings of fact and conclusions that the conveyance is not “unreasonable or injurious to her,” as required under former G.S. 47-39 and G.S. 52-12. West v. Hays, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 346 S.E.2d 690, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2507 (1986).

      <p>
       In determining the validity of a 1922 deed from a wife to a husband which was required to be in writing and acknowledged before a certifying officer who was required to make a private examination of the wife touching upon her voluntary execution of the contract, where the only omission was the certificate that the deed was not unreasonable or injurious to her and the deed was in all other respects regular, and there was no contention that there was any defect in the premises, the granting clause, the description, the habendum, or the warranties or that there was anything about the deed which was not regular except the lack of the certificate of the certifying officer as to injury or unreasonableness, this was certainly one of the situations to which this section was intended to apply. Otherwise, the curative statute would be stripped of all meaning. The deed was validated by subsection (b) of this section. Johnson v. Burrow, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 256 S.E.2d 811, <cite class="nc_code">1979 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2827 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would not validate a deed which failed to comply with former G.S. 52-12;
   
   even if this section would operate to validate the deed for failure of the certifying officer to conduct a private examination, the deed would still be invalid because the certifying officer failed to find whether or not the deed was unreasonable or injurious to the wife. Dunn v. Pate, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 390 S.E.2d 712, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 407 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A contract between a husband and wife to make a joint will was void as to the wife
   
   because it was not executed by her in accordance with former G.S. 52-6, and its invalidity was not affected by the curative statutes, G.S. 52-8 and this section, where both curative statutes were enacted after the rights of the parties under the contract vested upon the death of the husband, and the contract was not “in all other respects regular” except for the failure to privately examine the wife as required by the curative statutes.

        G.S. 39-13.5 Creates Exception to Rule in Subsection (b) of This Section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 39-13.5 requires that in order to create a tenancy by the entirety by division deed, the tenant in common must clearly state his intention in the granting clause. Where this was not done, the intention can be supplied by G.S. 39-13.3(b). G.S. 39-13.5 creates an exception to the rule of G.S. 39-13.3(b) that unless a contrary intent is shown, a deed to a husband and wife vests an estate in them as tenants by the entirety. Under G.S. 39-13.5, it is necessary to say so in the granting clause in order to create a tenancy by the entirety by a division deed. Brown v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C.

       Though conveyances from wife to husband dissolved the tenancy by the entirety in the parcels of land and vested title thereto solely in husband, as G.S. 39-13.3(c) provides, he nevertheless acquired title to the property thereunder, not by gift, but during the course of the marriage and before the parties separated, and property so acquired, so the General Assembly has declared, is ipso facto marital property. Thus, contrary to husband’s contention, dissolving the tenancy by the entirety did not remove the property involved from the ambit of the Equitable Distribution Act, and the trial judge did not err in finding and concluding otherwise.

However, 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f) had to be applied after the debtor’s interest was determined by subtracting the total of two deeds of trust from the value of the property, and then dividing that amount in half to arrive at the value of the debtor’s interest in the property; as her exemption (under G.S. 1C-1601(a)(1)) plus the amount of the judgment lien exceeded the value of her interest by more than the amount of the judgment, she was entitled to avoid the entire judgment lien.

        Bankruptcy Trustee’s Sale of Entireties Property. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistent with North Carolina law applicable outside of bankruptcy, the court concluded that following the Trustee’s sale the proceeds from the entireties property was subject to the claims of joint creditors only. Although the case law was divided on the issue, the better view was that the bankruptcy trustee’s sale of entireties property did not destroy the tenancy by the entirety. In re Surles, 2003 Bankr.

The trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the husband, the wife, a bank, and an insurance company that held the deed of trust, and although he reached a settlement with the husband and wife, neither the bank nor the insurance company filed a response or brief in opposition to the trustee’s motion for summary judgment within the 20-day period allowed by Bankr.

      North Carolina Introductory Comment
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Editor’s Note. —
     <i>
      The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
     </i>
    </p>
    <p>
     Prior to enactment of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (the “UFTA”), the statutory law of fraudulent conveyances in North Carolina was governed principally by former N.C. Gen. Stat. §
   39-15, which in turn was a substantial reenactment of the Statute of 13 Elizabeth (1570).
   <i>
    See Bank of New Hanover v. Adrian,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 537</cite>, 21 S.E. 792 (1895).
   As a reenactment of Elizabethan law, the statute was written in archaic language and was difficult to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1914 the North Carolina Supreme Court clarified fraudulent conveyance law in
   <i>
    Aman v. Walker,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 224</cite>, 815 S.E. 162 (1914), by articulating five distinct rules governing recovery under former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-15.
   Most published decisions after that date used
   <i>
    Aman v. Walker
   </i>
   as their point of reference in deciding fraudulent conveyance issues under North
   Carolina law.
   Prior to enactment of the UFTA, however, fraudulent conveyance law in North Carolina was developed by a series of ad hoc appellate decisions that are not altogether uniform or consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UFTA was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (the “NCCUSL”) and approved by that organization in 1984.
   It subsequently was approved by the American Bar Association in 1985.
   It is the modern successor to the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which was promulgated by the NCCUSL in 1918.
   Among other changes from the old act, the UFTA was broadened to make clear that it reaches transfers of personal as well as real property.
   The UFTA further is intended to function more congruently with the Uniform Commercial Code (codified as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.025.html" target="_blank">Chapter 25</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes) and the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, U.S. Code).
    </p>
    <p>
     While there are a number of differences between the UFTA and the old Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, there are a number of close parallels, and interpretations of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act can be useful in understanding the intent of the various provisions of the UFTA.
   A 1972 note by E. Cader Howard that appeared in the North Carolina Law Review comparing the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act with North Carolina law therefore is of special relevance in considering the changes effected by enactment of the UFTA in North Carolina.
   Note, “The Law of Fraudulent Conveyances in North Carolina: An Analysis and Comparison With the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyances Act,” 50

    </p>
    <p>
     For purposes of the North Carolina comments that follow, the rules articulated by
     <i>
      Aman v. Walker
     </i>
     are identified as the respective “principles”; and the note by E. Cader Howard is cited as “Howard,” with appropriate page references to the North Carolina Law Review

     Scope of Repeal.
   
   S.L. 1997-291 repealed former fraudulent conveyance law in Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.039.html" target="_blank">Chapter 39</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The insurance law contains its own provisions concerning fraudulent transfers by insurance companies within one year prior to insolvency.
     <i>
      See
     </i>
     N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-30-140.
   This statute, based on the comparable provision in bankruptcy law (11 U.S.C. § 548), complements general fraudulent conveyance law and concerns itself solely with transfers made within one year prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurance company.
   N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-30-140 is not affected by the enactment of the UFTA.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other references to fraudulent conveyances or transfers are found in Rule 18(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure; in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-2-402(b) and 25-2A-308(2) (sales and leases under the UCC); and in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 105-242 (dealing with the time within which judgments for taxes are enforceable).
   None of these statutes is affected by the enactment of the UFTA.

           The definition of “asset” is substantially to the same effect as the definition of “assets” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in this Act, unlike that in the earlier Act, does not, however, require a determination that the property is liable for the debts of the debtor. Thus, for example, an unliquidated claim for damages resulting from personal injury or a contingent claim of a surety for reimbursement, subrogation, restitution, contribution, or the like, may be counted as an asset for the purpose of determining whether the holder of the claim is solvent as a debtor under § 2 of this Act, even if applicable law does not allow such an asset to be levied on and sold by a creditor.

As the context may indicate, however, usage of the terms is not so restricted. See, e.g., §§ 1(1)(i)(B) and 1(9).

           The definition of “insider” is derived from Bankruptcy Code § 101(28) (1984). In this Act, as in the Bankruptcy Code, the definition states that the term “includes” certain listed persons; it does not state that the term “means” the listed persons. Hence the definition is not exclusive, and the statutory list is merely exemplary. See also Bankruptcy Code § 102(3) (1984). Accordingly, a person may be an “insider” of a debtor that is an individual, corporation or partnership even though the person is not designated as such by the statutory list. For example, a trust may be found to be an “insider” of a beneficiary. Similarly, a court may find a person living with an individual debtor for an extended time in the same household or as a permanent companion to have the kind of close relationship intended to be covered by the term “insider.” See also, e.g., Browning Interests v. Allison (In re Holloway), 955 F.2d 1008 (5th Cir.1992) (former spouse of debtor was an “insider” because of their close and continued personal relationship, even though they had long ago divorced and remarried others). Likewise, a person may be an “insider” of a debtor that is not an individual, corporation or partnership. See, e.g., In re Longview Aluminum, L.L.C., 657 F.3d 507 (7th Cir. 2011) (holding, under the Bankruptcy Code definition, that an individual serving on the Board of Managers of, and having a 12% membership interest in, a limited liability company was an “insider” of the company; the company’s organic documents vested management authority “in the Board of Managers and the Members”).

The definition of “conveyance” in § 1 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly comprehensive, and the references in this Act to “payment of money, release, lease, and the creation of a lien or encumbrance” are derived from the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. While the definition in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act did not explicitly refer to an involuntary transfer, the decisions under that Act were generally consistent with an interpretation that covered such a transfer. See, e.g., Hearn 45 St. Corp. v. Jano, 283 N.Y. 139, 27 N.E.2d 814, 128 A.L.R. 1285 (1940) (execution and foreclosure sales); Lefkowitz v. Finkelstein Trading Corp., 14 F.

     <p>
      Subparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) provide clarification by excluding from the term not only generally exempt property but also an interest in a tenancy by the entirety in many states and an interest that is generally beyond reach by unsecured creditors because subject to a valid lien. This Act, like the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, declares rights and provides remedies for unsecured creditors against transfers that impede them in the collection of their claims. The laws protecting valid liens against impairment by levying creditors, exemption statutes, and the rules restricting levyability of interest in entireties property are limitations on the rights and remedies of unsecured creditors, and it is therefore appropriate to exclude property interests that are beyond the reach of unsecured creditors from the definition of “asset” for the purposes of this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      A creditor of a joint tenant or tenant in common may ordinarily collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest, and in some states a creditor of a tenant by the entirety may likewise collect a judgment by process against the tenant’s interest. See 2 American Law of Property 10, 22, 28-32 (1952); Craig,
      <i>
       An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy
      </i>
      , 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258-59 (1974). The levyable interest of such a tenant is included as an asset under this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of “assets” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act excluded property that is exempt from liability for debts. The definition did not, however, exclude all property that cannot be reached by a creditor through judicial proceedings to collect a debt. Thus, it included the interest of a tenant by the entirety although in nearly half the states such an interest cannot be subjected to liability for a debt unless it is an obligation owed jointly by the debtor with his or her cotenant by the entirety. See 2 American Law of Property 29 (1952); Craig,
      <i>
       An Analysis of Estates by the Entirety in Bankruptcy
      </i>
      , 48 Am.Bankr.L.J. 255, 258 (1974). The definition in this Act requires exclusion of interests in property held by tenants by the entirety that are not subject to collection process by a creditor without a right to proceed against both tenants by the entirety as joint debtors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reference to “generally exempt” property in § 1(2)(ii) recognizes that all exemptions are subject to exceptions. Creditors having special rights against generally exempt property typically include claimants for alimony, taxes, wages, the purchase price of the property, and labor or materials that improve the property. See Uniform Exemptions Act § 10 (1979) and the accompanying Comment. The fact that a particular creditor may reach generally exempt property by resorting to judicial process does not warrant its inclusion as an asset in determining whether the debtor is insolvent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because this Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations (see Comment 9 to § 4), it does not preclude the holder of a claim that may be collected by process against property generally exempt as to other creditors from obtaining relief from a transfer of such property that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim. Likewise the holder of an unsecured claim enforceable against tenants by the entirety is not precluded by the Act from pursuing a remedy against a transfer of property held by the entirety that hinders, delays, or defrauds the holder of such a claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonbankruptcy law is the law of a state or federal law that is not part of the Bankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the United States Code. The definition of an “asset” thus does not include property that would be subject to administration for the benefit of creditors under the Bankruptcy Code unless it is subject under other applicable law, state or federal, to process for the collection of a creditor’s claim against a single debtor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The differences between the definition in this Act and that in the Bankruptcy Code are slight. In this Act, the definition has been restricted in clauses (i)(C), (ii)(E), and (iii)(D) to make clear that a partner is not an insider of an individual, corporation, or partnership if any of these latter three persons is only a limited partner. The definition of “insider” in the Bankruptcy Code does not purport to make a limited partner an insider of the partners or of the partnership with which the limited partner is associated, but it is susceptible of a contrary interpretation and one which would extend unduly the scope of the defined relationship when the limited partner is not a person in control of the partnership. The definition of “insider” in this Act also omits the reference in Bankruptcy Code § 101(28)(D) (1984) to an elected official or relative of such an official as an insider of a municipality.

       North Carolina Comment
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      The definitions of “affiliate,” “insider” and “relative” in subdivisions (1), (7) and (11) relate to liability for transfers to insiders described in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.5(b). This subsection had no counterpart under prior North Carolina law and, accordingly, these definitions have no prior North Carolina equivalent insofar as fraudulent conveyance law is concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of “asset” in subdivision (2) excludes property to the extent it is encumbered by a lien, is generally exempt from the claims of creditors or is held as entireties property. The intent of this definition is that only those transfers that adversely affect unsecured creditors can occasion liability. This is consistent with prior North Carolina law, which disregarded transfers of assets that were entireties property,
   <i>
    L &amp; M Gas Co. v. Leggett,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 547</cite>, 553, 161 S.E.2d 23, 27-28 (1968), or were subject to a resulting trust,

   <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 411</cite>, 415, 130 S.E. 45, 47 (1925).
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of “claim” in subdivision (3) is broad and includes potential liability on contingent claims. This seems consistent with prior North Carolina law: N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 18(b), allows a claim for fraudulent conveyance to be joined with a claim to establish the indebtedness that provides the foundation for the fraudulent conveyance claim. Subdivisions (4), (5) and (6) (providing definitions of “creditor,” “debt” and “debtor”) are based on the definition of “claim.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of “transfer” in subdivision (12) is broad; this breadth appears to be consistent with prior North Carolina law.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      Howard, 50
      <i>
       N.C. L. Rev.
      </i>
      at 876-77 (1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      The remaining definitions (of “lien,” “valid lien,” “person” and “property” in subdivisions (8), (13), (9) and (10)) appear to be straightforward. Prior North Carolina fraudulent conveyance law does not appear to have concerned itself with defining or explaining these terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Supplemental North Carolina Comment (2015)
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The amendments to the definition of “person” were not adopted because they deleted the specific reference to partnerships, based on the assumption that the Revised Uniform Partnership Act would apply within a state. That Uniform Act has not been enacted in this State as of the date of enactment of this act, so the drafters were of the opinion that the definition of “person” should not be changed to avoid an unintended consequence.

        A prior similar provision is a substantial reenactment of the statute 13 Eliz., c. 5, s. 2.
   
   Bank of New Hanover v. Adrian, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 537</cite>, 21 S.E. 792, 1895 N.C. LEXIS 244 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to enactment of a prior similar provision
   
   it was necessary to invoke the aid of a court of equity to have a deed declared void for fraud, and where, under a statutory provision, deeds were pronounced void as against creditors in order to secure a formal declaration of their invalidity, the moving party must have asked for relief that would have been formerly administered solely in a court of equity. Farthing v. Carrington, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 315</cite>, 22 S.E. 9, 1895 N.C. LEXIS 212 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        At an early period in the judicial history of this State, it was held that courts of law might hear evidence and pass even incidentally upon the question whether a deed was fraudulent under 13 Eliz. Logan v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. 13</cite>, 1834 N.C. LEXIS 7 (1834); Lee v. Flannagan, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. 471</cite>, 1847 N.C. LEXIS 83 (1847); Hardy &amp; Bro. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of 13 Eliz., is declaratory of the common law
   
   so far as regards existing creditors; in this sense the statute is sometimes spoken of as being in affirmance of the common law. The remedy given to subsequent creditors rests entirely upon the enactment of the statute. Long v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. 290</cite>, 1856 N.C. LEXIS 79 (1856).

       <p>
        “Transfer” in G.S. 39-23.9, barring fraudulent transfer claims after a certain time, meant when a transfer occurred, not when fraud became apparent to a creditor, because the statute said the limitations period for all fraudulent transfer claims began at the time of a transfer, or when a claimant should reasonably have known of the fraud.

       <p>
        Where plaintiffs received their property by deed of gift, the transfer was for insufficient consideration. Thus, the government need only show that the taxpayers were insolvent in order to void the conveyance, and thereby maintain a lien upon plaintiffs’ property. Ross v. United States, 861 F.

        Whether a conveyance, whatever its form, was in substance and fact a conveyance by the debtor-bankrupt, or by another such as a pledgee, is a jury question. Havee v. Belk, 775 F.2d 1209, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24370 (4th Cir. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment is generally inappropriate in an action for fraud
   
   because the existence of fraud necessarily involves a question concerning the existence of fraudulent intent, and the intent of a party is a state of mind generally within the exclusive knowledge of the party and that state of mind must, by necessity, be proved by circumstantial evidence. Lewis v. Blackman, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 448 S.E.2d 133, <cite class="nc_code">1994 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1033 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute 27 Elizabeth, from which former G.S. 39-16 is derived,
   
   enacts that conveyances of land, made with intent to defraud purchasers, shall only, as against purchasers for good consideration, be void. Under the act it was, of course, held that notice of the fraudulent deed did not impeach the title of the purchaser, because the bad faith of the deed vitiated it, and, with notice of the deed, the purchaser had also notice of the fraud. The legislature thought proper in 1840 to alter this, and to declare that no person shall be deemed a purchaser unless he purchased the land for the full value thereof, without notice, at the time of his purchase, of the conveyance by him alleged to be fraudulent. Hiatt v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 340</cite> (1848). See also dissenting opinion in Bank of New Hanover v. Adrian, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 537</cite>, 21 S.E. 792, 1895 N.C.

        A prior similar provision makes a qualification in the maxim “A man must to just before he is generous” in cases where the donor, at the time of the gift retained property, fully sufficient and available for the satisfaction of all of his then creditors. But this modification is confined to gifts inter vivos. In respect to legacies, or gifts by will, there has been no modification of the maxim; on the contrary, the legislation upon the subject tends to enforce a strict adherence to it, and the assent of an executor to a legacy, before he has paid all of the debts of the testator, is void as to creditors.

        The principles to be deduced from the authorities as to fraudulent conveyances, are: (1) If the conveyance is voluntary, and the grantor retains property fully sufficient and available to pay his debts then existing, and there is no actual intent to defraud, the conveyance is valid. (2) If the conveyance is voluntary, and the grantor does not retain property fully sufficient and available to pay his debts then existing, it is invalid as to creditors; but it cannot be impeached by subsequent creditors without proof of the existence of a debt at the time of its execution which is unpaid, and when this is established and the conveyance avoided, subsequent creditors are let in and the property is subjected to the payment of creditors generally. (3) If the conveyance is voluntary and made with the actual intent upon the part of the grantor to defraud creditors, it is void, although this fraudulent intent is not participated in by the grantee, and although property sufficient and available to pay existing debts is retained. (4) If the conveyance is upon a valuable consideration and made with the actual intent to defraud creditors upon the part of the grantor alone, not participated in by the grantee and of which intent he had no notice, it is valid. (5) If the conveyance is upon a valuable consideration, but made with the actual intent to defraud creditors on the part of the grantor, participated in by the grantee or of which he has notice, it is void.

        The intent is the essential and poisonous element in the transaction, and not merely the effect; since in every conveyance and appropriation of property, the property conveyed is placed beyond the creditor’s reach, and he is so far obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy against the debtor’s estate. But the inquiry is, was this the purpose of the assignment; and if so, and it was participated in by the assignee or party to take benefit under it, the assignment is invalid, though the debt or liability professed to be the object to be secured be bona fide due, and itself tinged with no vicious ingredient.

        It frequently becomes necessary, in order to ascertain the debtor’s intentions, to look for what are designated as “badges of fraud.” These badges of fraud are suspicious circumstances that overhang a transaction, and where the parties to it withhold testimony that it is exclusively within their power to produce, and that would remove all uncertainty, if believed, as to its character, the law puts the interpretation upon such conduct most unfavorable to the suppressing party as it does in all cases where a party purposely or negligently fails to furnish evidence under his control and not accessible to his adversary.

        Where mortgagees expressly agree to permit mortgagor to remain in possession of the stock of merchandise and sell the same in the usual course of trade, but do not require him to account for the proceeds of same, until he is adjudged bankrupt, the mortgage is presumptively fraudulent in law, and the burden is upon the mortgagor to rebut that presumption by proof that there were no preexisting debts at the time the mortgage was executed, or that the mortgagor had assets sufficient and available to pay the existing debts exclusive of the property embraced in the mortgage.

        Transfer of funds from a debtor’s lawsuit from the debtor to his wife was fraudulent and could be avoided and recovered by the trustee under 11 U.S.C.S. §§ 544 and 548, even if it was exempt under this section, where: (1) the debtor transferred the lawsuit proceeds into an account maintained by the wife, maintained access to the funds for his personal use and did not receive any consideration for them; (2) the relationship between parties and lack of adequate consideration established a presumption of actual fraudulent intent and shifted the burden to the wife; and (3) the wife did not meet her burden to rebut the presumption.

        Trial court correctly concluded that a wife’s transfer of property to her son constituted a fraudulent transfer because the transfer was to an insider, the transfer was concealed from the husband, the property was gifted to the son after the wife filed her complaint for equitable distribution, and the wife made the transfer without receiving a reasonable equivalent value in exchange; thus, the trial court had jurisdiction to order that the transfer of the deed be avoided.

Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 531</cite> (1880), an examination of the section will show that Coor v. Spicer was a palpable inadvertence. Ward v.

        Trial court erred by ordering a wife’s son to pay a husband the majority of equity the son gained during the wife’s fraudulent “gift/transfer” to him of real property because it lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order against the son, who was a non-party to the action.

        Indebtedness at the time of making a voluntary conveyance of part only of the grantor’s property is, in respect to subsequent creditors seeking satisfaction out of the property conveyed, merely evidence of fraud, the consideration of which belongs to the jury; but in respect to prior creditors, where debts cannot be otherwise satisfied, it constitutes fraud in law to be declared by the court.

       <p>
        Where there is any evidence tending to show that at the time of the alleged fraudulent conveyance the grantor retained property fully sufficient and available to satisfy his then creditors, the presumption of fraud formerly arising from a voluntary conveyance is removed by this section, and the indebtedness of the grantor is evidence only from which a fraudulent intent may be inferred. Thus a requested instruction is properly refused which requires the defendant to satisfy the jury by the greater weight of the evidence that he retained property fully sufficient and available. Shuford v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 52</cite>, 85 S.E. 142, 1915 N.C. LEXIS 145 (1915) (citing) Hobbs v. Cashwell, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 183</cite>, 67 S.E. 495, 1910 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of a prior similar provision is to destroy any presumption of vitiating fraud in the making of a voluntary gift or settlement solely from the indebtedness of the donor or settler, and to make the failure to retain property fully sufficient and available for the satisfaction of creditors a requisite of such presumption. Hood v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 128</cite>, 176 S.E. 288, 1934 N.C. LEXIS 397 (1934); Virginia-Carolina Laundry Supply Corp. v.

        Earlier decisions of the Supreme Court were to the effect that, notwithstanding this section, there was a presumption of fraudulent intent in the case of a voluntary conveyance by a debtor and the burden rested upon the party seeking to uphold the voluntary conveyance to show retention by the grantor of property sufficient to pay his then debts. These cases may no longer be regarded as correct statements of the law of this jurisdiction with regard to the question of which party must ultimately bear the burden of proof upon the question of retention by the grantor of sufficient property to pay his then existing debts. That burden is now placed upon the party attacking the conveyance. Virginia-Carolina Laundry Supply Corp. v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 145</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 1, 1966 N.C.

        If, in order to survive a motion for judgment of nonsuit, the plaintiff must offer evidence sufficient in itself to show that its debtors, the defendant grantors in the deed of trust, did not retain property sufficient to pay their indebtedness to the plaintiff (no other debts being shown in the record), the judgment of nonsuit must be sustained where the only evidence offered by the plaintiff, upon this point, consisted of the tax listings by such defendants of their tangible properties in a particular county. Such tax listings do not negative the possibilities that these defendants, after executing the deed of trust in question, retained, and still retain, bank accounts or other intangible properties in the county or elsewhere, or tangible property, real or personal, located in another county, sufficient to pay the claim of the plaintiff and whatever other indebtedness these defendants may owe.

        Though the ultimate burden of proof rests upon the plaintiff to show either actual intent by the defendant grantors to defraud their creditors or failure by them to retain property sufficient to pay their then existing debts, when the plaintiff introduces an admission by the defendants that their deed of trust was “voluntary,” and introduces evidence that they were then indebted to the plaintiff, which debt has not been paid, this is evidence tending to show an intent to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors sufficient to carry the case to the jury for its determination of the issue, and a judgment of nonsuit is improperly granted.

      <li id="t39a3As39-23.2ol21">
       Subsection (a) is derived from the definition of “insolvent” in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29)(A) (1984). The definition in subsection (a) contemplates a fair valuation of the debts as well as the assets of the debtor. The 2014 amendments reword subsection (a) in order to eliminate the elegant variation in the original text between “the sum of” debts and “all of” assets, and to make clearer that “fair valuation” applies to debts as well as to assets. No change in meaning is intended.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.2ol22">
       Subsection (b) establishes a rebuttable presumption of insolvency from the fact of general nonpayment of debts as they become due. Such general nonpayment is a ground for the filing of an involuntary petition under Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (1978). See also U.C.C. § 1-201(23) (1962) (defining a person to be “insolvent” who “has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business”). The 2014 amendments to this Act clarify that general nonpayment of debts does not count nonpayment as a result of a bona fide dispute. That was the intended meaning of the language before 2014, as stated in the official comments, and the cited provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the Uniform Commercial Code have been similarly clarified. See Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (2014); U.C.C. § 1-203(b)(23) (2014) (defining “insolvent” to include “having generally ceased to pay debts in the ordinary course of business other than as a result of bona fide dispute”).
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.2ol23">
       Subsection (c) follows the approach of the definition of “insolvency” in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29) (1984) by excluding from the computation of the value of the debtor’s assets any value that can be realized only by avoiding a transfer of an interest formerly held by the debtor or by discovery or pursuit of property that has been concealed or removed with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.2ol24">
       Subsection (d) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 101(29) (1984). It makes clear that a person is not rendered insolvent under this section by counting as a debt an obligation secured by property of the debtor that is not counted as an asset. See also Comment 2 to § 1 and Comment 1 to § 2.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Financial accounting standards may permit or require fair value measurement of an asset or a debt. The fair value of an asset or a debt for financial accounting purposes may be based on standards that are not appropriate for use in subsection (a). For example, Fin. Accounting Standards Bd., Accounting Standards Codification /P¶ 820-10-35-17 to -18 (2014) (formerly
      <i>
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157: Fair Value Measurement
      </i>
      ¶ 15 (2006)) requires for financial accounting purposes that the “fair value” of a liability reflect nonperformance risk (i.e., the risk that the debtor will not pay the liability as and when due). By contrast, proper application of subsection (a) excludes any adjustment to the face amount of a liability on account of nonperformance risk. Such an adjustment would be contrary to the purpose of subsection (a), which is to assess the risk that the debtor will not be able to satisfy its liabilities. Only in unusual circumstances would the “fair valuation” for the purpose of subsection (a) of a liquidated debt be other than its face amount. Examples of such circumstances include discounting the face amount of a contingent debt to reflect the probability that the contingency will not occur, and discounting the face amount of a non-interest-bearing debt that is due in the future in order to reduce the debt to its present value.
     </p>
     <p>
      As under the definition of the term “insolvent” in § 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, exempt property is excluded from the computation of the value of the assets. See § 1(2). For similar reasons interests in valid spendthrift trusts and interests in tenancies by the entireties that are not subject to process by a creditor of only one tenant are not included. See Comment 2 to § 1. Because a valid lien also precludes an unsecured creditor from collecting the creditor’s claim from the encumbered interest in a debtor’s property, both the encumbered interest and the debt secured thereby are excluded from the computation of insolvency under this Act. See § 1(2) and subsection (d) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) defines the effect of the presumption to be (in paraphrase) that the burden of persuasion on the issue of insolvency shifts to the defendant. That conforms to the default definition of the effect of a presumption in civil cases set forth in Uniform Rules of Evidence (1974 Act), Rule 301(a) (later Rule 302(a) (1999 Act as amended 2005)). It also conforms to the Final Draft of Federal Rule 301 as submitted to the United States Supreme Court by the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Evidence in 1973. “The so-called ‘bursting bubble’ theory, under which a presumption vanishes upon the introduction of evidence which would support a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact, even though not believed, is rejected as according presumptions too ‘slight and evanescent’ an effect.” Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 301, 56 F.R.D. 183, 208 (1973). See also 1 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, Evidence ¶ 301[01] (1982). It should be noted that the Federal Rule of Evidence as finally enacted gave by default a different effect to presumptions in civil cases, in effect adopting the “bursting bubble” definition. See Fed. R. Evid. 301 (1975) (carried forward in the 2011 revision). The statement of the effect of the presumption in subsection (b) was added by the 2014 amendments to this Act, but subsection (b) was intended to have the same meaning before 2014, as stated in the official comments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The presumption is established in recognition of the difficulties typically imposed on a creditor in proving insolvency in the bankruptcy sense, as provided in subsection (a). See generally Levit,
      <i>
       The Archaic Concept of Balance-Sheet Insolvency,
      </i>
      47 Am.Bankr.L.J. 215 (1973). Not only is the relevant information in the possession of a debtor that is apt to be noncooperative, but the debtor’s records are apt to be incomplete and inaccurate. As a practical matter, insolvency is most cogently evidenced by a general cessation of payment of debts, as has long been recognized by the laws of other countries and is now reflected in the Bankruptcy Code. See Honsberger,
      <i>
       Failure to Pay One’s Debts Generally as They Become Due: The Experience of France and Canada
      </i>
      , 54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 153 (1980); J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 13, 63-64, 436 (1956). In determining whether a debtor is paying its debts generally as they become due, the court should look at more than the amount and due dates of the indebtedness. The court should also take into account such factors as the number of the debtor’s debts, the proportion of those debts not being paid, the duration of the nonpayment, and the existence of bona fide disputes or other special circumstances alleged to constitute an explanation for the stoppage of payments. The court’s determination may be affected by a consideration of the debtor’s payment practices prior to the period of alleged nonpayment and the payment practices of the trade or industry in which the debtor is engaged. The case law that has developed under Bankruptcy Code § 303(h)(1) (1984) has not required a showing that a debtor has failed or refused to pay a majority in number and amount of the debtor’s debts in order to prove general nonpayment of debts as they become due. See,

      North Carolina fraudulent conveyance cases have long determined solvency by contrasting a person’s assets with his liabilities, and have rejected a test concerning whether the person is able to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business.

      Subsection (b) creates a presumption that a person not generally paying his debts is insolvent.
   While there appear to be no North Carolina fraudulent conveyance cases that have recognized such a presumption, subsection (b) is consistent with North Carolina definitions of insolvency in some other contexts.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-1-201(23) (UCC definition of insolvency); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 58-30-10(13) (definition of insolvency for purposes of laws dealing with insolvent insurance companies); N.C.

     </p>
     <p>
      The definition of insolvency as it relates to partnerships (subsection (c)) appears to be without precedent in North Carolina fraudulent conveyance law, but follows from the concept of a partnership as an association of partners each of whom is liable for the partnership’s debts.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      N.C. Gen. Stat. §

       This section defines when “value” is given for a transfer or an obligation. “Value” is used in that sense in various contexts in this Act, frequently with a qualifying adjective. Used in that sense the word appears in the following provisions:
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.3ol22">
       Section 3(a) is adapted from Bankruptcy Code § 548(d)(2)(A) (1984). See also § 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. The definition in Section 3 is not exclusive. “Value” is to be determined in light of the purpose of the Act to protect a debtor’s estate from being depleted to the prejudice of the debtor’s unsecured creditors. Consideration having no utility from a creditor’s viewpoint does not satisfy the statutory definition. The definition does not specify all the kinds of consideration that do not constitute value for the purposes of this Act—e.g., love and affection. See, e.g., United States v. West, 299 F. Supp. 661, 666 (D.Del. 1969).
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.3ol23">
       Section 3(a) does not indicate what is “reasonably equivalent value” for a transfer or obligation. Under this Act, as under Bankruptcy Code § 548(a)(2) (1984), a transfer for security is ordinarily for a reasonably equivalent value notwithstanding a discrepancy between the value of the asset transferred and the debt secured, because the amount of the debt is the measure of the value of the interest in the asset that is transferred. See, e.g., Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Co. v. Holy Family Polish Nat’l Catholic Church, Carnegie, Pa., 341 Pa. 390, 19 A.2d 360 (1941). If the debt is a voidable obligation under this Act, a transfer to secure it as well as the obligation would be vulnerable to attack as voidable. A transfer to satisfy or secure an antecedent debt owed an insider is also subject to avoidance under the conditions specified in Section 5(b).
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.3ol24">
       Section 3(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act has been thought not to recognize that an unperformed promise could constitute fair consideration. See McLaughlin, Application of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, 46 Harv.L.Rev. 404, 414 (1933). Courts construing these provisions of the prior law nevertheless have held unperformed promises to constitute value in a variety of circumstances. See, e.g., Harper v. Lloyd’s Factors, Inc., 214 F.2d 662 (2d Cir. 1954) (transfer of money for promise of factor to discount transferor’s purchase-money notes given to fur dealer); Schlecht v. Schlecht, 168 Minn. 168, 176-77, 209 N.W. 883, 886-87 (1926) (transfer for promise to make repairs and improvements on transferor’s homestead); Farmer’s Exchange Bank v. Oneida Motor Truck Co., 202 Wis. 266, 232 N.W. 536 (1930) transfer in consideration of assumption of certain of transferor’s liabilities; see also Hummel v. Cernocky, 161 F.2d 685 (7th Cir. 1947) (transfer in consideration of cash, assumption of a mortgage, payment of certain debts, and agreement to pay other debts). Likewise a transfer in consideration of a negotiable note discountable at a commercial bank, or the purchase from an established, solvent institution of an insurance policy, annuity, or contract to provide care and accommodations clearly appears to be for value. On the other hand, an unperformed promise by an individual to support a parent or other transferor has generally been held not to constitute value. See, e.g., Springfield Ins. Co. v. Fry, 267 F. Supp. 693 (N.D.Okla. 1967); Sandler v. Parlapiano, 236 App.Div. 70, 258 N.Y.Supp. 88 (1st Dep’t 1932); Warwick Municipal Employees Credit Union v. Higham, 106 R.I. 363, 259 A.2d 852 (1969); Hulsether v. Sanders, 54 S.D. 412, 223 N.W. 335 (1929); Cooper v. Cooper, 22 Tenn.App. 473, 477, 124 S.W.2d 264, 267 (1939); Note, Rights of Creditors in Property Conveyed in Consideration of Future Support, 45 Iowa L.Rev. 546, 550-62 (1960). This Act adopts the view taken in the cases cited in determining whether an unperformed promise is value.

       Subsection (b) rejects the rule of such cases as Durrett v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 621 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1980) (nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage avoided as a voidable transfer when the property of an insolvent mortgagor was sold for less than 70% of its fair value); and Abramson v. Lakewood Bank &amp; Trust Co., 647 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164 (1982) (nonjudicial foreclosure held to be voidable transfer if made without fair consideration). Subsection (b) adopts the view taken in Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Madrid (In re Madrid), 21 B.R. 424 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1982), aff’d on another ground, 725 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1984), that the price bid at a regularly conducted and noncollusive foreclosure sale determines the fair value of the property sold for purposes of voidable transfer law.

      Subsection (b) prescribes the effect of a sale meeting its requirements, whether the asset sold is personal or real property. It applies only to a sale under a mortgage, deed of trust, or security agreement. Subsection (b) thus does not apply to a sale foreclosing a nonconsensual lien, such as a tax lien. However, the subsection does apply to a foreclosure by sale of the interest of a vendee under an installment land contract in accordance with applicable law that requires or permits the foreclosure to be effected by a sale in the same manner as the foreclosure of a mortgage. See G. Osborne, G. Nelson, &amp; D. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law 83-84, 95-97 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a lien given an insider for a present consideration is not perfected as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser or is so perfected after a delay following an extension of credit secured by the lien, foreclosure of the lien may result in a transfer for an antecedent debt that is voidable under Section 5(b).
   Subsection (b) does not apply to an action under Section 4(a)(1) to avoid a transfer or obligation because made or incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor.

       North Carolina Comment
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) concerns itself with what constitutes “value.”
   The term, qualified with adjectives (principally “reasonably equivalent value”) appears throughout N.C. Gen. Stat. §
   39-23.4, -23.5 and -23.8.
   Two actions are stated to constitute the giving of “value”:
   transfers of property and securing or satisfying prior debt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior North Carolina law has dealt with what constitutes “full value” or “good consideration,” terms that were employed in former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-16 and -19.
   The inquiry has generally focused on the amount of consideration, however, rather than on its character.
   Two types of consideration that have been analyzed in prior law are prior indebtedness (so-called “antecedent debt”) and unfulfilled (“executory”) promises.
   As to antecedent debt, prior North Carolina law laid down the same rule as that set out in subsection (a): antecedent debt qualified as consideration.
   <i>

     <p>
      Executory promises of support constituted consideration under prior North Carolina law, subject to a number of exceptions and limits.
   Services furnished to relatives were presumed to be gratuitous; the relationship of the parties could go far toward raising a presumption that a transfer involved fraudulent intent.

      at 881-82.
   Subsection (a) excludes from the definition of value unperformed promises to furnish support, subject only to an exception for a promise made in the ordinary course of the provisor’s business.
   This blanket exclusion represents a change from prior North Carolina law.
   Subsection (a) does not expressly address unperformed promises other than to furnish support.
      <i>
       But see
      </i>
      Official Comment 4.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) rejects the so-called “Durrett” rule.
      <i>
       See Durrett v. Washington National Ins. Co.,
      </i>
      621 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1980) (dealing with the Bankruptcy Act provision analogous to Bankruptcy Code § 548(a)(2)); Official Comment 5.
   The Durrett rule has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court.
      <i>
       BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.,
      </i>
      511 U.S. 531 (1994).
   There is no North Carolina law on this subject.
   However subsection (b) is consistent with the philosophy of North Carolina’s unique Part 6 of Article 9 of the UCC (N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-9-601
      <i>
       et seq.
      </i>
      ), which adopts a conclusive presumption that a sale conducted in a certain manner is commercially reasonable.

       When fraudulent transfers were alleged, it was error to grant summary judgment in favor of transferees because no facts supported piercing the corporate veil as to two corporations, so no antecedent debt payment constituted reasonably equivalent value, when a debtor transferred funds to the transferees, creating fact issues under G.S. 39-23.5, G.S. 39-23.4, and G.S. 39-23.8.

      <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a">
       A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:
       <ol>

             Section 4(a)(1) is derived from § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which in turn was derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, c. 5 (1571).  Factors appropriate for consideration in determining actual intent under Section 4(a)(1) are specified in subsection (b).
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b2">
             Section 4, unlike § 5, protects creditors of a debtor whose claims arise after as well as before the debtor made or incurred the challenged transfer or obligation. Similarly, there is no requirement in § 4(a)(1) that the intent referred to be directed at a creditor existing or identified at the time of transfer or incurrence. For example, promptly after the invention in Pennsylvania of the spendthrift trust, the assets and beneficial interest of which are immune from attachment by the beneficiary’s creditors, courts held that a debtor’s establishment of a spendthrift trust for the debtor’s own benefit is a voidable transfer under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, without regard to whether the transaction is directed at an existing or identified creditor. Mackason’s Appeal, 42 Pa. 330, 338-39 (1862); see also, e.g., Ghormley v. Smith, 139 Pa. 584, 591-94 (1891); Patrick v. Smith, 2 Pa. Super. 113, 119 (1896). Cf. Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 58(2) (2003) (setting forth a substantially similar rule as a matter of trust law). Likewise, for centuries § 4(a)(1) and its predecessors have been employed to invalidate nonpossessory property interests that are thought to be potentially deceptive, without regard to whether the deception is directed at an existing or identified creditor. See, e.g., McGann v. Capital Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 89 A.2d 123, 183-84 (Vt. 1952) (seller’s retention of possession of goods after sale held voidable); Superior Partners v. Prof’l Educ. Network, Inc., 485 N.E.2d 1218, 1221 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (similar); Clow v. Woods, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle 275 (Pa. 1819) (holding that a nonpossessory chattel mortgage is voidable, in the absence of a system for giving public notice of such interests such as is today supplied by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code).
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b3">
             Section 4(a)(2) is derived from §§ 5 and 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “reasonably equivalent value” for “fair consideration.”  The transferee’s good faith was an element of “fair consideration” as defined in § 3 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, and lack of fair consideration was one of the elements of a fraudulent transfer as defined in four sections of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.  The transferee’s good faith is irrelevant to a determination of the adequacy of the consideration under this Act, but lack of good faith may be a basis for withholding protection of a transferee or obligee under § 8.
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b4">
             Unlike the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, this Act does not prescribe different tests for voidability of a transfer that is made for the purpose of security and a transfer that is intended to be absolute.  The premise of this Act is that when a transfer is for security only, the equity or value of the asset that exceeds the amount of the debt secured remains available to unsecured creditors and thus cannot be regarded as the subject of a voidable transfer merely because of the encumbrance resulting from an otherwise valid security transfer.  Disproportion between the value of the asset securing the debt and the size of the debt secured does not, in the absence of circumstances indicating a purpose to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, constitute an impermissible hindrance to the enforcement of other creditors’ rights against the debtor-transferor.  Cf. U.C.C. § 9-401(b) (2014) (providing that a debtor’s interest in collateral subject to a security interest is transferable notwithstanding an agreement with the secured party prohibiting transfer).
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b5">
             Subparagraph (i) of § 4(a)(2) is an adaptation of § 5 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act but substitutes “unreasonably small [assets] in relation to the business or transaction” for “unreasonably small capital.”  The reference to “capital” in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act might be interpreted, incorrectly, to refer to the par value of stock or to the consideration received for stock issued.  The special meanings of “capital” in corporation law have no relevance in the law of voidable transfers.  The subparagraph focuses attention on whether the amount of all the assets retained by the debtor was inadequate, i.e., unreasonably small, in light of the needs of the business or transaction in which the debtor was engaged or about to engage.
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b6">
             Subsection (b) is a nonexclusive catalogue of factors appropriate for consideration by the court in determining whether the debtor had an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud one or more creditors.  Proof of the existence of any one or more of the factors enumerated in subsection (b) may be relevant evidence as to the debtor’s actual intent but does not create a presumption that the debtor has made a voidable transfer or incurred a voidable obligation.  The list of factors includes most of the so-called “badges of fraud” that have been recognized by the courts in construing and applying the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and § 7 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.  Proof of the presence of certain badges in combination establishes voidability conclusively—i.e., without regard to the actual intent of the debtor—when they concur as provided in § 4(a)(2) or in § 5.  The fact that a transfer has been made to a relative or to an affiliated corporation has not been regarded as a badge of fraud sufficient to warrant avoidance when unaccompanied by any other evidence of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.  The courts have uniformly recognized, however, that a transfer to a closely related person warrants close scrutiny of the other circumstances, including the nature and extent of the consideration exchanged.  See 1 G. Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences § 307 (Rev. ed. 1940).  The second, third, fourth, and fifth factors listed are all adapted from the classic catalogue of badges of fraud provided by Lord Coke in Twyne’s Case, 3 Coke 80b, 76 Eng.Rep. 809 (Star Chamber 1601).  Lord Coke also included the use of a trust and the recitation in the instrument of transfer that it “was made honestly, truly, and bona fide,” but the use of the trust is voidable only when accompanied by indicia of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and recitals of “good faith” can no longer be regarded as significant evidence of intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.

Thus the court may appropriately take into account all indicia negativing as well as those suggesting intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, as illustrated in the following reported cases:
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b8">
             The phrase “hinder, delay, or defraud” in § 4(a)(1), carried forward from the primordial Statute of 13 Elizabeth, is potentially applicable to any transaction that unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights. Section 4(a)(1) is sometimes said to require “actual fraud,” by contrast to § 4(a)(2) and § 5(a), which are said to require “constructive fraud.” That shorthand is highly misleading. Fraud is not a necessary element of a claim for relief under any of those provisions. By its terms, § 4(a)(1) applies to a transaction that “hinders” or “delays” a creditor, even if it does not “defraud” the creditor. See, e.g., Shapiro v. Wilgus, 287 U.S. 348, 354 (1932); Means v. Dowd, 128 U.S. 273, 288-89 (1888); Consove v. Cohen (In re Roco Corp.), 701 F.2d 978, 984 (1st Cir. 1983); Empire Lighting Fixture Co. v. Practical Lighting Fixture Co., 20 F.2d 295, 297 (2d Cir. 1927); Lippe v. Bairnco Corp., 249 F. Supp. 2d 357, 374 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). “Hinder, delay, or defraud” is best considered to be a single term of art describing a transaction that unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights. Such a transaction need not bear any resemblance to common-law fraud. Thus, the Supreme Court held a given transfer voidable because made with intent to “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors, but emphasized: “We have no thought in so holding to impute to [the debtor] a willingness to participate in conduct known to be fraudulent…. [He] acted in the genuine belief that what [he] planned was fair and lawful. Genuine the belief was, but mistaken it was also. Conduct and purpose have a quality imprinted on them by the law.” Shapiro v. Wilgus. 287 U.S. 348, 357 (1932).

             This Act is not an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See § 1, Comment 2. For example, the Uniform Commercial Code supplements or modifies the operation of this Act in numerous ways. Instances include the following:
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b10">
             Subsection (c) was added in 2014. Sections 2(b), 4(c), 5(c), 8(g), and 8(h) together provide uniform rules on burdens and standards of proof relating to the operation of this Act.
            </li>
            <li id="t39a3As39-23.4ol1a2b11">
             Subsection (c) allocates to the party making a claim for relief under § 4 the burden of persuasion as to the elements of the claim. Courts should not apply nonstatutory presumptions that reverse that allocation, and should be wary of nonstatutory presumptions that would dilute it. The command of § 13—that this Act is to be applied so as to effectuate its purpose of making uniform the law among states enacting it—applies with particular cogency to nonstatutory presumptions. Given the elasticity of key terms of this Act (e.g., “hinder, delay, or defraud”) and the potential difficulty of proving others (e.g., the financial condition tests in § 4(a)(2) and § 5), employment of divergent nonstatutory presumptions by enacting jurisdictions may render the law nonuniform as a practical matter. It is not the purpose of subsection (c) to forbid employment of any and all nonstatutory presumptions. Indeed, in some instances a judicially-crafted presumption applied under this Act or its predecessors has won such favor as to be codified as a separate statutory creation. Examples include the bulk sales laws, the absolute priority rule applicable to reorganizations under Bankruptcy Code § 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) (2014), and the so-called “constructive fraud” provisions of § 4(a)(2) and § 5(a) of this Act itself. However, subsection (c) and § 13 mean, at the least, that a nonstatutory presumption is suspect if it would alter the statutorily-allocated burden of persuasion, would upset the policy of uniformity, or is an unwarranted carrying-forward of obsolescent principles. An example of a nonstatutory presumption that should be rejected for those reasons is a presumption that the transferee bears the burden of persuasion as to the debtor’s compliance with the financial condition tests in § 4(a)(2) and § 5, in an action under those provisions, if the transfer was for less than reasonably equivalent value (or, as another example, if the debtor was merely in debt at the time of the transfer). See Fidelity Bond &amp; Mtg. Co. v. Brand, 371 B.R. 708, 716-22 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (rejecting such a presumption previously applied in Pennsylvania).

      Section 4(a)(1) has the meaning elaborated in the preceding paragraph, but it is of course possible that a jurisdiction in which this Act is in force might enact other legislation that modifies the results of the particular examples given to illustrate that meaning. For example, some states have enacted legislation authorizing the establishment and funding of self-settled spendthrift trusts, subject to specified conditions. In such a state, such legislation will supersede the historical interpretation referred to in the preceding paragraph, either expressly or by necessary implication, with respect to allowed transfers to such a statutorily-validated trust. See,
      <i>
       e.g.
      </i>
      , Del. Code. Ann. tit. 12, § 3572(a), (b) (2014). See also Comment 8. Likewise, the historical skepticism of nonpossessory property interests has been superseded as to security interests in personal property by the Uniform Commercial Code. See Comment 9.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subparagraph (ii) of § 4(a)(2) is an adaptation of § 6 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, which relates to a debtor that has or will have debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they become due (a condition that is sometimes referred to as “insolvency in the equity sense”). Subparagraph (ii) carries forward the previous Act’s language capturing a debtor that “intends” or “believes” that the debtor is or will be unable to pay the debtor’s debts as they become due, and adds to that language capturing a debtor that “reasonably should have believed” the same. The added language makes clear that subparagraph (ii) also captures a debtor that, on the basis of objective assessment, has or will have debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they become due, regardless of the debtor’s subjective belief.

      Diminution of the assets available to the debtor’s creditors is not necessarily required to “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors. For example, the age-old legal skepticism of nonpossessory property interests, which stems from their potential for deception, has often resulted in their avoidance under § 4(a)(1) or its predecessors. See Comments 2 and 7(b);
      <i>
       cf.
      </i>
      Comment 9. A transaction may “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors although it neither reduces the assets available to the debtor’s creditors nor involves any potential deception. See,
      <i>
       e.g., Shapiro v. Wilgus
      </i>
      , 287 U.S. 348 (1932) (holding voidable a solvent individual debtor’s conveyance of his assets to a wholly-owned corporation for the purpose of instituting a receivership proceeding not available to an individual).
     </p>
     <p>
      A transaction that does not place an asset entirely beyond the reach of creditors may nevertheless “hinder, delay, or defraud” creditors if it makes the asset more difficult for creditors to reach. Simple exchange by a debtor of an asset for a less liquid asset, or disposition of liquid assets while retaining illiquid assets, may be voidable for that reason. See,
      <i>
       e.g., Empire Lighting Fixture Co. v. Practical Lighting Fixture Co.
      </i>
      , 20 F.2d 295, 297 (2d Cir. 1927) (L. Hand, J.) (credit sale by a corporation to an affiliate of its plant, leaving the seller solvent with ample accounts receivable, held voidable because made with intent to hinder creditors of the seller, due to the comparative difficulty of creditors realizing on accounts receivable under then-current collection practice). Overcollateralization of a debt that is made with intent to hinder the debtor’s creditors, by rendering the debtor’s equity in the collateral more difficult for creditors to reach, is similarly voidable. See Comment 4. Likewise, it is voidable for a debtor intentionally to hinder creditors by transferring assets to a wholly-owned corporation or other organization, as may be the case if the equity interest in the organization is more difficult to realize upon than the assets (either because the equity interest is less liquid, or because the applicable procedural rules are more demanding). See,
      <i>
       e.g., Addison v. Tessier
      </i>
      , 335 P.2d 554, 557 (N.M. 1959);
      <i>
       First Nat’l Bank. v. F. C. Trebein Co.
      </i>
      , 52 N.E. 834, 837-38 (Ohio 1898); Anno., 85 A.L.R. 133 (1933).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the same principle, § 4(a)(1) would render voidable an attempt by the owners of a corporation to convert it to a different legal form (
      <i>
       e.g.
      </i>
      , limited liability company or partnership) with intent to hinder the owners’ creditors, as may be the case if an owner’s interest in the alternative organization would be subject only to a charging order, and not to execution (which would typically be available against stock in a corporation). See,
      <i>
       e.g., Firmani v. Firmani
      </i>
      , 752 A.2d 854, 857 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000);
      <i>
       cf. Interpool Ltd. v. Patterson
      </i>
      , 890 F. Supp. 259, 266-68 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (similar, but relying on a “good faith” requirement of the former Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act rather than that act’s equivalent of § 4(a)(1)). If such a conversion is done with intent to hinder creditors, it contravenes § 4(a)(1) regardless of whether it is effected by conveyance of the corporation’s assets to a new entity or by conversion of the corporation to the alternative form. In both cases the owner begins with the stock of the corporation and ends with an ownership interest in the alternative organization, a property right with different attributes. Either is a “transfer” under the designedly sweeping language of § 1(16), which encompasses “every mode…of…parting with an asset or an interest in an asset.”
      <i>
       Cf., e.g., United States v. Sims (In re Feiler)
      </i>
      , 218 F.3d 948 (9th Cir. 2000) (debtor’s irrevocable election under the Internal Revenue Code to waive carryback of net operating losses is a “transfer” under the substantially similar definition in the Bankruptcy Code);
      <i>
       Weaver v. Kellogg
      </i>
      , 216 B.R. 563, 573-74 (S.D. Tex. 1997) (exchange of notes owed to the debtor for new notes having different terms is a “transfer” by the debtor under that definition).
     </p>
     <p>
      In § 4(a)(1), the phrase “hinder, delay, or defraud,” like the word “intent,” is a term of art whose words do not have their dictionary meanings. For example, every grant of a security interest “hinders” the debtor’s unsecured creditors in the dictionary sense of that word. Yet it would be absurd to suggest that every grant of a security interest contravenes § 4(a)(1). The line between permissible and impermissible grants cannot coherently be drawn by reference to the debtor’s subjective mental state, for a rational person knows the natural consequences of his actions, and that includes the adverse consequences to unsecured creditors of any grant of a security interest. See,
      <i>
       e.g., Dean v. Davis
      </i>
      , 242 U.S. 438, 444 (1917) (equating an act whose “obviously necessary effect” is to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors with an act intended to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors);

       In re Sentinel Management Group Inc.
      </i>
      , 728 F.3d 660, 667 (7th Cir. 2013). Whether a transaction is captured by § 4(a)(1) ultimately depends upon whether the transaction unacceptably contravenes norms of creditors’ rights, given the devices legislators and courts have allowed debtors that may interfere with those rights. Section 4(a)(1) is the regulatory tool of last resort that restrains debtor ingenuity to decent limits.

      Thus, for example, suppose that entrepreneurs organize a business as a limited liability company, contributing assets to capitalize it, in the ordinary situation in which none of the owners has particular reason to anticipate personal liability or financial distress and no other unusual facts are present. Assume that the LLC statute has the creditor-thwarting feature of precluding execution upon equity interests in the LLC and providing only for charging orders against such interests. Notwithstanding that feature, the owners’ transfers of assets to capitalize the LLC is not voidable under § 4(a)(1) as in force in the same state. The legislature in that state, having created the LLC vehicle having that feature, must have expected it to be used in such ordinary circumstances. By contrast, if owners of an existing business were to reorganize it as an LLC under such a statute when the clouds of personal liability or financial distress have gathered over some of them, and with the intention of gaining the benefit of that creditor-thwarting feature, the transfer effecting the reorganization should be voidable under § 4(a)(1), at least absent a clear indication that the legislature truly intended the LLC form, with its creditor-thwarting feature, to be available even in such circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the laws of different jurisdictions differ in their tolerance of particular creditor-thwarting devices, choice of law considerations may be important in interpreting § 4(a)(1) as in force in a given jurisdiction. For example, as noted in Comment 2, the language of § 4(a)(1) historically has been interpreted to render voidable a transfer to a self-settled spendthrift trust. Suppose that jurisdiction X, in which this Act is in force, also has in force a statute permitting an individual to establish a self-settled spendthrift trust and transfer assets thereto, subject to stated conditions. If an individual Debtor whose principal residence is in X establishes such a trust and transfers assets thereto, then under § 10 of this Act the voidable transfer law of X applies to that transfer. That transfer cannot be considered voidable in itself under § 4(a)(1) as in force in X, for the legislature of X, having authorized the establishment of such trusts, must have expected them to be used. (Other facts might still render the transfer voidable under X’s enactment of § 4(a)(1).) By contrast, if Debtor’s principal residence is in jurisdiction Y, which also has enacted this Act but has no legislation validating such trusts, and if Debtor establishes such a trust under the law of X and transfers assets to it, then the result would be different. Under § 10 of this Act, the voidable transfer law of Y would apply to the transfer. If Y follows the historical interpretation referred to in Comment 2, the transfer would be voidable under § 4(a)(1) as in force in Y.

       U.C.C. § 2-402(2) (2014) recognizes the generally prevailing rule that retention of possession of goods by a seller may be voidable, but limits the application of the rule by negating any imputation of voidability from “retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification.” (Indeed, independently of § 2-402(2), retention of possession of goods in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification should not in itself be considered to “hinder, delay, or defraud” any creditor of the merchant-seller under § 4(a)(1).)

      This Act operates independently of rules in an organic statute applicable to a business organization that limit distributions by the organization to its equity owners. Compliance with those rules does not insulate such a distribution from being voidable under this Act. It is conceivable that such an organic statute might contain a provision preempting the application of this Act to such distributions.

      </i>
      Model Business Corporation Act § 152 (optional provision added in 1979 preempting the application of “any other statutes of this state with respect to the legality of distributions”; deleted 1984). Such a preemptive statute of course must be respected if applicable, but choice of law considerations may well render it inapplicable. See,
      <i>
       e.g., Faulkner v. Kornman (In re The Heritage Organization, L.L.C.)

      Pursuant to subsection (c), proof of intent to “hinder, delay, or defraud” a creditor under § 4(a)(1) is sufficient if made by a preponderance of the evidence. That is the standard of proof ordinarily applied in civil actions. Subsection (c) thus rejects cases that have imposed an extraordinary standard, typically “clear and convincing evidence,” by analogy to the standard commonly applied to proof of common-law fraud. That analogy is misguided. By its terms, § 4(a)(1) applies to a transaction that “hinders” or “delays” a creditor even if it does not “defraud,” and a transaction to which § 4(a)(1) applies need not bear any resemblance to common-law fraud. See Comment 8. Furthermore, the extraordinary standard of proof commonly applied to common-law fraud originated in cases that were thought to involve a special danger that claims might be fabricated. In the earliest such cases, a court of equity was asked to grant relief on claims that were unenforceable at law for failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds, the Statute of Wills, or the parol evidence rule. In time, extraordinary proof also came to be required in actions seeking to set aside or alter the terms of written instruments. See
      <i>
       Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston
      </i>
      , 459 U.S. 375, 388-89 (1983) and sources cited therein. Those reasons for extraordinary proof do not apply to claims for relief under § 4(a)(1).
     </p>
     <p>
      For similar reasons, a procedural rule that imposes extraordinary pleading requirements on a claim of “fraud,” without further gloss, should not be applied to a claim under § 4(a)(1). The elements of a claim under § 4(a)(1) are very different from the elements of a claim of common-law fraud. Furthermore, the reasons for such extraordinary pleading requirements do not apply to a claim under § 4(a)(1). Unlike common-law fraud, a claim under § 4(a)(1) is not unusually susceptible to abusive use in a “strike suit,” nor is it apt to be of use to a plaintiff seeking to discover unknown wrongs. Likewise, a claim under § 4(a)(1) is unlikely to cause significant harm to the defendant’s reputation, for the defendant is the transferee or obligee, and the elements of the claim do not require the defendant to have committed even an arguable wrong.

       North Carolina Comment
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section and N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.5 are the primary provisions of the UFTA, as they define which transfers are voidable.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section differs from the version promulgated by the NCCUSL in three respects.
   The General Assembly deleted the phrase “or reasonably should have believed” in subsubdivision (a)(2)b. and added subdivision (b)(12). Because the drafters believed that this change converted constructive intent from an element of a conveyance deemed fraudulent to a factor to be considered in determining intent, the phrase “actual intent” was changed to “intent” in subsubdivision (a)(2)b. and the introductory language of subsection (b).
   The General Assembly also added subdivision (b)(13).
     </p>
     <p>
      The reference to “obligation incurred” in subsection (a) represents a change from prior North Carolina law, and reflects a recognition that a debtor can harm creditors by incurring a fraudulent debt as well as by making a fraudulent transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for the change described in the preceding sentence, subdivision (a)(1) does not change fraudulent transfer law in North Carolina.
   Under prior law, once a creditor had shown actual fraud on the part of the debtor, the transfer was void whether the creditor’s claim was in existence at the time of the transaction or arose subsequently.
   <i>
    See generally
   </i>
   Howard, 50
   <i>
    N.C. L. Rev.
   </i>
   at 887.
   Subdivision (a)(1) is subject to an important limitation:
   under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.8(a), a transfer or obligation is not voidable under subdivision (a)(1) against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value.
   With that limitation, subdivision (a)(1) is consistent with prior North Carolina law.
   <i>
    See
   </i>
   former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-19;
   <i>
    Aman v. Walker,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 224</cite>, 227, 81 S.E. 162, 164 (1914) (principle four).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subdivision (a)(2) is intended to address transactions for less than “reasonably equivalent value” that leave a debtor undercapitalized (
      <i>
       see
      </i>
      Official Comment 4) and applies both to present and subsequent creditors.
   It should be contrasted with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.5(a), which addresses transactions for less than “reasonably equivalent value” made when a debtor is or becomes “insolvent” but which applies only to creditors whose claims arose before the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior North Carolina law invalidated transactions for less than a “reasonably fair price” when the debtor failed “to retain property fully sufficient and available to pay his debts then existing.”

   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 224</cite>, 227, 18 S.E. 162, 164 (1914) (principle two).
   The rule clearly applied to transactions occurring when a debtor was “insolvent” in a “balance sheet” sense.
   <i>
    See
   </i>
   North Carolina Comment to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.2.
   Under prior law a subsequent creditor could use the fact that a conveyance left a business with “unreasonably small capital” as evidence of fraud, but the creditor nevertheless would have to prove fraudulent intent in order to void the conveyance. Howard,
   <i>
    50 N.C. L. Rev.
   </i>
   at 888.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subdivision (a)(2) refers to transactions causing a debtor to incur debts beyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they become due.
   As noted, under prior law when a debtor engaged in a transaction for less than a “reasonably fair price” and failed “to retain property fully sufficient and available to pay his creditors then existing,” the transaction generally was voidable only by a creditor whose claim was in existence as of the time of the transaction in question.
      <i>
       See
      </i>
      North Carolina Comment to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.5. Subdivision (a)(2) broadens prior law since it can be invoked “whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after” the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) is a non-exclusive list of “badges of fraud” that can be considered in establishing a debtor’s fraudulent intent within the meaning of subdivision (a)(1).
   North Carolina law has long recognized “badges of fraud” in fraudulent conveyance litigation,
   <i>
    see, e.g., Peebles v. Horton,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 374</cite>, 377 (1870), and decisions have identified several of the factors enumerated in subsection (b).
   Among these factors are close family relationship (

   <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 251</cite>, 262, 11 S.E. 470, 474 (1890)).
   As noted above, subdivision (b)(12) incorporates language deleted from UFTA § 4(a), where it would have had a more automatic effect, rather than being a “factor” that “may” be considered, and subdivision (b)(13) is wholly new.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under prior law certain combinations of “badges of fraud” could give rise to a rebuttable presumption of fraudulent intent.

       Government was entitled to enforce a tax lien against a bankruptcy debtor’s account to satisfy the tax liability of a taxpayer who had no interest in the debtor, since the taxpayer’s transfer of judgment proceeds to the taxpayer’s spouse who then used the proceeds to fund the debtor was fraudulent; the transfer was to the spouse as an insider for no monetary consideration, the taxpayer retained control of the funds by writing checks on the spouse’s account, the taxpayer transferred substantially all of the taxpayer’s assets, and the taxpayer knew or should have known that the funds were taxable.

       Bankruptcy court dismissed a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a></cite> trustee’s complaint seeking an order which required a grain dealer to turn over more than a million bushels of grain it withdrew from a corporation’s silos more than ninety days before the corporation declared bankruptcy, after it learned that the corporation was selling its grain without its permission. The trustee’s claim seeking an order under 11 U.S.C.S. § 542 which required the dealer to turn over the grain failed because it did not allege facts that supported a reasonable inference that the dealer possessed the grain or retained control of it after the corporation declared bankruptcy, and the evidence did not show that the corporation made a preferential transfer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 547 or a fraudulent transfer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548, or G.S. 39-23.1 et seq. when it allowed the dealer to take its grain.

       It was error to grant summary judgment in favor of a creditor, under G.S. 39-23.4(a)(1), because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether (1) a debtor transferred funds in question with fraudulent intent and (2) a transferee took the funds in good faith.

       Plaintiff established that defendant’s transfer of properties to a trust established by his wife were made with actual intent to defraud for purposes of the North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA) where defendant and his wife had a long and clear history of using her name to conceal defendant’s money, property interests, and other assets. Both defendant and his wife jointly planned and executed the transfer of the properties with the specific intent to hinder plaintiff’s collection efforts related to a judgment, the trust was a mechanism used in effectuating this transfer, and the transfer was part of a broader scheme to structure their assets to deliberately evade plaintiff’s collection efforts.

       Trustee had sufficiently alleged claims under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548(a)(1)(A) and G.S. 39-23.4(a)(1) when he alleged that individuals transferred funds to the debtor for the purpose of investing in factoring programs; that the debtor was conducting very little or no actual commerce or legitimate commercial activities, but represented that he was conducting legitimate business operations; that no actual profits or earnings were produced in any material fashion from the operation of the fictitious factoring program; and that to the extent any alleged profits or returns were made on the investments, they were funded through additional funds obtained from additional investors into the fictitious factoring program. The trustee had therefore successfully invoked the “Ponzi presumption” under which payments made in furtherance of such a scheme were presumed to be fraudulent. Ivey v.

       Summary judgment was properly granted to a bank seeking to set aside real property transfers by a loan guarantor to her children and their spouses based on the following statutory factors: transferring the property to insiders; retaining control and income of the property after the transfers; making the transfers after a suit had been threatened or initiated; transferring almost all of the transferor’s assets; and receiving less than reasonably equivalent value for deeded property.

      <p>
       Trial court correctly concluded that a wife’s transfer of property to her son constituted a fraudulent transfer because the transfer was to an insider, the transfer was concealed from the husband, the property was gifted to the son after the wife filed her complaint for equitable distribution, and the wife made the transfer without receiving a reasonable equivalent value in exchange; thus, the trial court had jurisdiction to order that the transfer of the deed be avoided.

Jirasek, 254 Mich. 131, 139, 235 N.W. 836, 389 (1931) (mortgage given by debtor to his brother to secure an antecedent debt owed the brother sustained as not voidable).

       Subsection (b) does not extend as far as § 8(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and Bankruptcy Code § 548(b) (1984) in rendering voidable a transfer made by an insolvent partnership to a partner. A general partner is an insider of the partnership, but a transfer by the partnership to the partner nevertheless is not vulnerable to avoidance under § 5(b) unless the transfer is for an antecedent debt and the partner has reasonable cause to believe that the partnership is insolvent. By contrast, the cited provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and the Bankruptcy Code make any transfer by an insolvent partnership to a general partner voidable. Avoidance of the partnership transfer without reference to the partner’s state of mind and the nature of the consideration exchanged would be unduly harsh treatment of the creditors of the partner and unduly favorable to the creditors of the partnership.

      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      As in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.4(a), subsection (a) here adds “obligation incurred” as potential subjects of fraudulent transfer law.
   In other respects subsection (a) corresponds to principle two of
   <i>
    Aman v. Walker,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 224</cite>, 227, 81 S.E. 162, 164 (1914), which invalidated conveyances for less than a “reasonably fair price” where the debtor “did not retain property fully sufficient and available to pay his debts then existing.”
   Subsection (a) is narrower than prior law in one respect, however.
   Prior law gave standing to challenge a transaction only to creditors with claims in existence at the time of the transaction that remained unpaid,
   <i>
    see Powell Bros. v. McMullan Lumber Co.,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 52</cite>, 58, 68 S.E. 926, 928-29 (1910), but once the transaction was voided, subsequent creditors could participate in the redistribution of assets recovered.
   Subsection (a), however, states only that the defined category of transactions “is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before” the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effect of subsection (b) is to create a cause of action for “insider preferences” roughly comparable to similar claims under § 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §
   547).
   Unlike 11 U.S.C. § 547, however, subsection (b) contains the requirement that the insider must have had “reasonable cause to believe” the debtor was insolvent.
   N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.8(f) contains several defenses addressed specifically to subsection (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) has no counterpart under prior North Carolina law.

P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim filed by a development company, a real estate company, the majority shareholder of the development company, and his wife, who controlled the real estate company, the investment company’s complaint complied with the requirement that a claim advanced pursuant to G.S. 39-23.5(a) include a showing that the debtor be insolvent at the time of the transfer or that the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.

       Bank was entitled to summary judgment on the receiver’s fraudulent transfer claim because the LLC received the loan proceeds the bank lent to the LLC’s members and the payments the LLC made with money from the receiver’s company were made in exchange for reasonably equivalent value and thus were not constructively fraudulent.

       Plaintiff’s claim arose before the alleged fraudulent transfer and it was clear that defendant two did not pay defendant one for the transfer of its assets and business; therefore, defendant one did not receive reasonably equivalent value when its assets and business were transferred to defendant two, and summary judgment was properly granted in plaintiff’s favor for fraudulent transfer.

           One of the uncertainties in the law governing the avoidance of transfers and obligations of the nature governed by this Act is the time at which the cause of action arises. Section 6 clarifies that point in time. For transfers of real property other than a fixture, paragraph (1)(i) fixes the time as the date of perfection against a good-faith purchaser from the transferor. For transfers of fixtures and assets constituting personalty, paragraph (1)(ii) fixes the time as the date of perfection against a judicial lien creditor not asserting rights under this Act. Perfection under paragraph (1) typically is effected by notice-filing, recordation, or delivery of unequivocal possession. See U.C.C. §§ 9-310, 9-313 (2014) (security interest in personal property generally is perfected by notice-filing or delivery of possession to transferee); 4 American Law of Property §§ 17.10-17.12 (1952) (recordation of transfer or delivery of possession to grantee required for perfection against bona fide purchaser from grantor). The provision for postponing the time a transfer is made until its perfection is an adaptation of Bankruptcy Code § 548(d)(1) (1984). When no steps are taken to perfect a transfer that applicable law permits to be perfected, the transfer is deemed by paragraph (2) to be perfected immediately before the filing of an action to avoid it; without such a provision to cover that eventuality, an unperfected transfer arguably would be immune to attack. Some transfers may not be amenable to perfection as against a bona fide purchaser or judicial lien creditor. In the event that a transfer may not be perfected as provided in paragraph (1), paragraph (3) provides that the transfer occurs for the purpose of this Act when the transferor effectively parts with an interest in the asset.
          </li>
          <li id="t39a3As39-23.6ol15b2">
           Paragraph (4) requires the transferor to have rights in the asset transferred before the transfer is made for the purpose of this section.  This provision makes clear that the purpose of this section may not be circumvented by notice-filing or recordation of a document evidencing an interest in an asset to be acquired in the future. Cf. Bankruptcy Code § 547(e) (1984); U.C.C. § 9-203(b)(2) (2014).

          <li id="t39a3As39-23.6ol15b3">
           Paragraph (5) had no analogue in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.  It is intended to resolve uncertainty arising from Rubin v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 661 F.2d 979, 989-91, 997 (2d Cir. 1981), insofar as that case holds that an obligation of guaranty may be deemed to be incurred when advances covered by the guaranty are made rather than when the guaranty first became effective between the parties.  Compare Rosenberg, Intercorporate Guaranties and the Law of Fraudulent Conveyances: Lender Beware, 125 U.Pa.L.Rev. 235, 256-57 (1976).

             This section is derived from §§ 9 and 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act.  Section 9 of that Act specified the remedies of creditors whose claims have matured, and § 10 enumerated the remedies available to creditors whose claims have not matured.  A creditor holding an unmatured claim may be denied the right to receive payment from the proceeds of a sale on execution until the claim has matured, but the proceeds may be deposited in court or in an interest-bearing account pending the maturity of the creditor’s claim.  The remedies specified in this section are not exclusive.

            <li id="t39a3As39-23.7ol1a3c2">
             The availability of an attachment or other provisional remedy has been restricted by amendments of statutes and rules of procedure in response to Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1 (1991), Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337 (1969), and their progeny.  This judicial development and the procedural changes that followed in its wake do not preclude resort to attachment by a creditor in seeking avoidance of a transfer or obligation.  See, e.g., Britton v. Howard Sav. Bank, 727 F.2d 315, 317-20 (3d Cir. 1984); Computer Sciences Corp. v. Sci-Tek Inc., 367 A.2d 658, 661 (Del. Super. 1976); Great Lakes Carbon Corp. v. Fontana, 54 A.D.2d 548, 387 N.Y.S. 2d 115 (1st Dep’t 1976).  Section 7(a)(2) continues the authorization for the use of attachment contained in § 9(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, or of a similar provisional remedy, when applicable law provides therefor, subject to the constraints imposed by the due process clauses of the United States and state constitutions.

             Subsections (a) and (b) of § 10 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act authorized the court, in an action on a voidable transfer or obligation, to restrain the defendant from disposing of his property, to appoint a receiver to take charge of his property, or to make any order the circumstances may require.  Section 10, however, applied only to a creditor whose claim was unmatured.  There is no reason to restrict the availability of these remedies to such a creditor, and the courts have not so restricted them.  See, e.g., Lipskey v. Voloshen, 155 Md. 139, 143-45, 141 Atl. 402, 404-05 (1928) (judgment creditor granted injunction against disposition of property by transferee, but appointment of receiver denied for lack of sufficient showing of need for such relief); Matthews v.

             If a transfer or obligation is voidable under § 4 or § 5, the basic remedy provided by this Act is its avoidance under subsection (a)(1). “Avoidance” is a term of art in this Act, for it does not mean that the transfer or obligation is simply rendered void. It has long been established that a transfer avoided by a creditor under this Act or its predecessors is nevertheless valid as between the debtor and the transferee. For example, in the case of a transfer of property worth $100 by Debtor to Transferee, held voidable in a suit by Creditor-1 who is owed $80 by Debtor, “avoidance” of the transfer leaves the $20 surplus with Transferee. Debtor is not entitled to recover the surplus. Nor is Debtor’s Creditor-2 entitled to pursue the surplus by reason of Creditor-1’s action (though Creditor-2 may be entitled to bring its own avoidance action to pursue the surplus). The foregoing principle is embedded in the language of subsection (a)(1), which prescribes “avoidance” only “to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim.” Section 9(a) of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act was similarly limited. See, e.g., Becker v. Becker, 416 A.2d 156, 162 (Vt. 1980); De Martini v. De Martini, 52 N.E.2d 138, 141 (Ill. 1943); Markward v.

The transferee’s mental state is irrelevant to the foregoing, but a good-faith transferee may also be afforded protection by § 8.

     <p>
      It follows that “avoidance” of an obligation under subsection (a)(1) likewise should not mean its cancellation, but rather a remedy that recognizes the existence of the obligation and the superiority of the plaintiff creditor’s interest over the obligee’s interest. Ordinarily that should mean subordination of the obligation to the plaintiff creditor’s claim against the debtor. That would entail disgorgement by the obligee of any payments received or receivable on the obligation, to the extent necessary to satisfy the plaintiff creditor’s claim, with the obligee being subrogated to the plaintiff creditor when the latter’s claim is paid. Of course, if the obligation is unenforceable for reasons other than contravention of this Act, contravention of this Act does not render the obligation enforceable.

      This Comment relates to the meaning of subsection (a)(1). If this Act is invoked in a bankruptcy proceeding, the remedial entitlements provided by the Bankruptcy Code may differ from those provided by this Act.

       North Carolina Comment

     <p>
      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      The remedies provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.7 are cumulative and are not exclusive.
   Subdivision (a)(1)’s remedy of avoiding the fraudulent transfer is consistent with prior North Carolina fraudulent conveyance law, which was derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Attachment and other pre-judgment remedies or relief under subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(3) are subject to applicable due process protections.
   They also are subject to the substantive and procedural requirements separately provided for those remedies under applicable law.
      <i>
       See, e.g.,
      </i>
      N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 1-440.1,
      <i>
       et seq.
      </i>
      ; 1A-1, Rule 65; 1-485,
      <i>
       et seq.
      </i>
      ; and 1-501,
      <i>
       et seq.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      Any request for pre-judgment or post-judgment relief against a transferee under subsections (a)(3) or (b), or against an asset in the hands of a transferee, necessarily requires due process as to the transferee.
   For example, such a transferee has a right to notice and an opportunity to appear and assert the defenses and protections available under § 39-23.8. This is consistent with prior North Carolina law, which also required that the transferee be given notice of a fraudulent conveyance action.

        No Jurisdiction to Enter Order Against Non-Party. —

      <p>
       Trial court erred by ordering a wife’s son to pay a husband the majority of equity the son gained during the wife’s fraudulent “gift/transfer” to him of real property because it lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order against the son, who was a non-party to the action.

      <p>
       Because properties had already been sold by the initial transferee to bona fide third-party purchasers, voiding the transfer from defendant to transferee was neither practical nor permitted under the North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA). Because the properties had passed beyond the reach of plaintiff, he would be entitled to levy execution against the proceeds, but no tracing evidence was offered; however, he was entitled to an alternative remedy of a judgment against the initial transferee for the value of the asset transferred, subject to adjustment as the equities might require.

        Transfer of Deed Avoided. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court correctly concluded that a wife’s transfer of property to her son constituted a fraudulent transfer because the transfer was to an insider, the transfer was concealed from the husband, the property was gifted to the son after the wife filed her complaint for equitable distribution, and the wife made the transfer without receiving a reasonable equivalent value in exchange; thus, the trial court had jurisdiction to order that the transfer of the deed be avoided.

             Subsection (c) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 550(a), (b) (1984). The measure of the recovery of a creditor against a transferee is usually limited to the value of the asset transferred at the time of the transfer. See, e.g., United States v. Fernon, 640 F.2d 609, 611 (5th Cir. 1981); Hamilton Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Halstead, 134 N.Y. 520, 31 N.E. 900 (1892); cf. Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., 289 U.S. 227 (1932) (transferee’s objection to trial court’s award of highest value of asset between the date of the transfer and the date of the decree of avoidance rejected because an award measured by value as of time of the transfer plus interest from that date would have been larger). The premise of § 8(c) is that changes in value of the asset transferred that occur after the transfer should ordinarily not affect the amount of the creditor’s recovery. Circumstances may require a departure from that measure of the recovery, however, as the cases decided under the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and other laws derived from the Statute of 13 Elizabeth illustrate. Thus, if the value of the asset at the time of levy and sale to enforce the judgment of the creditor has been enhanced by improvements of the asset transferred or discharge of liens on the property, a good-faith transferee should be reimbursed for the outlay for such a purpose to the extent the sale proceeds were increased thereby. See Bankruptcy Code § 550(d) (1984); Janson v. Schier, 375 A.2d 1159, 1160 (N.H. 1977); Anno., 8 A.L.R. 527 (1920). If the value of the asset at the time of the transfer has been diminished by severance and disposition of timber or minerals or fixtures, the transferee should be liable for the amount of the resulting reduction. See Damazo v. Wahby, 269 Md. 252, 257, 305 A.2d 138, 142 (1973). If the transferee has collected rents, harvested crops, or derived other income from the use or occupancy of the asset after the transfer, the liability of the transferee should be limited in any event to the net income after deduction of the expense incurred in earning the income. Anno., 60 A.L.R.2d 593 (1958). On the other hand, adjustment for the equities does not warrant an award to the creditor of consequential damages alleged to accrue from mismanagement of the asset after the transfer.

            <li id="t39a3As39-23.8ol1b1b4">
             Subsection (d) is an adaptation of Bankruptcy Code § 548(c) (1984). An insider that receives property or an obligation from an insolvent debtor as security for or in satisfaction of an antecedent debt of the transferor or obligor is not a good-faith transferee or obligee if the insider has reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred. If a foreclosure sale is voidable and does not qualify for the benefit of § 3(b) or § 8(e)(2) because it was not conducted in accordance with the requirements of applicable law, the buyer, if in good faith, will still be entitled to the benefit of subsection (d) to the extent of the price paid by the buyer.

             The provisions of § 8 are integral elements of the rights created by this Act. Accordingly, they should apply if this Act is invoked in a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b) (2014). That follows from the fundamental principle that property rights in bankruptcy should be the same as outside bankruptcy, unless a federal interest compels a different result. See Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979). Section 8(b) limits damages under this Act to the amount of the plaintiff creditor’s claim, and that limitation is overridden in bankruptcy by the rule of Moore v. Bay, 284 U.S. 4 (1931), which Congress unmistakably maintained when it enacted the Bankruptcy Code. In the absence of a clear override by the Bankruptcy Code or other federal law, however, other aspects of § 8 should apply if this Act is invoked in bankruptcy. See, e.g., Decker v. Tramiel (In re JTS Corp.), 617 F.3d 1102, 1110-16 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that § 8(d) applies to a claim for relief brought under this Act in a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Code § 544(b)).

     <p>
      The requirement of Bankruptcy Code § 550(b)(1) (1984) that a transferee be “without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer” in order to be protected has been omitted as inappropriate. Knowledge of the facts rendering the transfer voidable would be inconsistent with the good faith that is required of a protected transferee. Knowledge of the voidability of a transfer would seem to involve a legal conclusion. Determination of the voidability of the transfer ought not to require the court to inquire into the legal sophistication of the transferee.
     </p>
     <p>
      A transfer of property by the transferee of a voidable transfer might, on appropriate facts, be avoidable for reasons independent of the original voidable transfer. In such a case the subsequent transferee may be entitled to a defense under § 8(b) to an action based on the original voidable transfer, but that defense would not apply to an action based on the subsequent transfer that is independently voidable. For example, suppose that X transfers property to Y in a transfer voidable under this Act, and that Y later transfers the property to Z, who is a good-faith transferee for value. In general, C-1, a creditor of X, would have the right to a money judgment against Y pursuant to § 8(b), but C-1 could not recover under this Act from Z, who would be protected by § 8(b)(1)(ii)(A). However, it might be the case that Y’s transfer to Z is independently voidable as to Y’s creditors (including C-1, as creditor of Y by dint of its rights under this Act). Such might be the case if, for example, the value received by Y in exchange for the transfer is not reasonably equivalent and Y is in financial distress, or if Y made the transfer with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any of its creditors. In such a case creditors of Y may pursue remedies against Z with respect to that independently voidable transfer, and the defense afforded to Z by § 8(b)(1)(ii)(A) would not apply to that action. Of course choice of law must be considered in such a situation: the jurisdiction whose law governs the voidability of the original transfer from X to Y and the consequent liability of Y and subsequent transferees need not be the same as the jurisdiction whose law governs the voidability of the independently voidable transfer from Y to Z and the consequent liability of Z and subsequent transferees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e)(2) protects a transferee that acquires a debtor’s interest in an asset as a result of the enforcement by a secured party (which may but need not be the transferee) of rights pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Part 6 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
      <i>
       Cf. Calaiaro v. Pittsburgh Nat’l Bank (In re Ewing)
      </i>
      , 33 B.R. 288, 9 C.B.C.2d 526, CCH B.L.R. ¶ 69,460 (Bankr. W.D.Pa. 1983) (sale of pledged stock held subject to avoidance under § 548 of the Bankruptcy Code),

      </i>
      , 36 B.R. 476 (W.D.Pa. 1984) (transfer held not voidable because deemed to have occurred more than one year before bankruptcy petition filed). The global requirement of Article 9 that the secured party enforce its rights in good faith, and the further requirement of Article 9 that certain remedies be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, provide substantial protection to the other creditors of the debtor. See U.C.C. §§ 1-304, 9-607(b), 9-610(b) (2014). The exemption afforded by subsection (e)(2) does not extend to acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligations it secures. That remedy, contemplated by U.C.C. §§ 9-620—9-622 (2014), is sometimes referred to as “strict foreclosure.” An exemption for strict foreclosure is inappropriate because compliance with the rules of Article 9 relating to strict foreclosure may not sufficiently protect the interests of the debtor’s other creditors if the debtor does not act to protect equity the debtor may have in the asset.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (1) is adapted from Bankruptcy Code § 547(c)(4) (1984), which permits a preferred creditor to set off the amount of new value subsequently advanced against the recovery of a voidable preference by a trustee in bankruptcy to the debtor without security.
   The new value may consist not only of money, goods, or services delivered on unsecured credit but also of the release of a valid lien.
   See,
      <i>
       e.g., In re Ira Haupt &amp; Co
      </i>
      ., 424 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1970);

       In re John Morrow &amp; Co
      </i>
      ., 134 F. 686, 688 (S.D.Ohio 1901).
   It does not include an obligation substituted for a prior obligation. If the insider receiving the preference thereafter extends new credit to the debtor but also takes security from the debtor, the injury to the other creditors resulting from the preference remains undiminished by the new credit.
   On the other hand, if a lien taken to secure the new credit is itself voidable by a judicial lien creditor of the debtor, the new value received by the debtor may appropriately be treated as unsecured and applied to reduce the liability of the insider for the preferential transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (2) is derived from Bankruptcy Code § 547(c)(2) (1984), which excepts certain payments made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs from avoidance by the trustee in bankruptcy as preferential transfers.
   Whether a transfer was in the “ordinary course” requires a consideration of the pattern of payments or secured transactions engaged in by the debtor and the insider prior to the transfer challenged under § 5(b).
   See Tait &amp; Williams,
      <i>
       Bankruptcy Preference Laws: The Scope of Section 547(c)(2)
      </i>
      , 99 Banking L.J. 55, 63-66 (1982).
   The defense provided by paragraph (2) is available, irrespective of whether the debtor or the insider or both are engaged in business, but the prior conduct or practice of both the debtor and the insider-transferee are relevant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (3) has no analogue in Bankruptcy Code § 547 (1984). It reflects a policy judgment that an insider who has previously extended credit to a debtor should not be deterred from extending further credit to the debtor in a good-faith effort to save the debtor from a forced liquidation in bankruptcy or otherwise.
   A similar rationale has sustained the taking of security from an insolvent debtor for an advance to enable the debtor to stave off bankruptcy and extricate itself from financial stringency.

      , 242 U.S. 438, 444 (1917). The amount of the present value given, the size of the antecedent debt secured, and the likelihood of success for the rehabilitative effort are relevant considerations in determining whether the transfer was in good faith.

       North Carolina Comment
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) is consistent with former fraudulent conveyance law in North Carolina.
   <i>
    See, e.g.,
   </i>
   former N. C. Gen. Stat. § 39-19;
   <i>
    Aman v. Walker,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 224</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 162 (1914) (principle four).
   A transferee has the burden of establishing good faith and the reasonable equivalence of the consideration exchanged.
   Subsection (b) restricts a complaining creditor to relief equal to the lesser of the amount of his claim or the value of the property transferred, and in this respect is comparable to section 550(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 550(a).
   Unlike former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-15, which provided only for avoidance of a conveyance in its entirety, subsection (b) establishes limits on a transferee’s liability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) is significant if the value of an asset has changed while in the hands of a transferee.
   As a matter of equity, when a transferee has enhanced the asset’s value through improvements, the transferee should be entitled to retain the value of that increase despite avoidance of the transfer.
   Similarly, when a transferee has decreased the value (for example, by mining, harvesting timber or removing pre-existing improvements or fixtures), the transferee should be liable for the reduction.
   Subsection (c) allows a court, through application of equitable principles, to allocate post-transfer changes in value among the competing parties, which was not an issue specifically addressed under prior North Carolina statute or case law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) provides that, when a transfer is avoided, a good faith transferee who gave less than reasonably equivalent value does not forfeit the value of the consideration given. It is an adaptation of section 548(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 548(c), and preserves for a transferee specific rights in the property to the extent of actual value given. North Carolina’s former fraudulent conveyance statutes did not provide similar protections for a good faith transferee, nor had the North Carolina courts addressed this issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (f) allows insiders certain additional defenses for transfers otherwise avoidable under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.5(b), which effectively balances that section’s refusal to allow an insider’s antecedent debt to qualify as reasonably equivalent value.
   Subsection (f) is derived from section 547(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 547(c).
   The foundation of each of these defenses to “preferential” payment of insider debts — new value, ordinary course of business or financial affairs, and contemporaneous provision of value given in good faith to rehabilitate — is that encouraging normalized dealings with a financially distressed debtor may help that debtor avoid insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy, which is in the best interests of all creditors.

       Because properties had already been sold by the transferee (a trust established by defendant’s wife) to bona fide third-party purchasers, voiding the transfer from defendant to transferee was neither practical nor permitted under the North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA). However, plaintiff was entitled to an alternative remedy against defendant’s wife and the trust, jointly and severally, as a result of the transfer because she failed to treat the trust as a separate entity and used it as a mere instrumentality to effectuate the transfer of the properties.

       This section had no analogue in the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act. Its purpose is to make clear that lapse of the statutory periods prescribed by the section bars the right and not merely the remedy. The section rejects the rule applied in United States v. Gleneagles Inv. Co., 565 F. Supp. 556, 583 (M.D.Pa. 1983) (state statute of limitations held not to apply to action by United States based on Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act). Another consequence of barring the right and not merely the remedy is that, under Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 143 (1971), if an action is brought in jurisdiction A and the action is determined to be governed by this Act as enacted in jurisdiction B, the action cannot be maintained if it is time-barred in jurisdiction B. The 1988 revision of §§ 142 and 143 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, which eliminated the right/remedy distinction, should not be applied to this Act. Because a voidable transfer or obligation may injure all of a debtor’s many creditors, there is need for a uniform and predictable cutoff time.

      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9ol22">
       Statutes of limitations applicable to the avoidance of transfers and obligations vary widely from state to state and are frequently subject to uncertainties in their application. See Hesson, The Statute of Limitations in Actions to Set Aside Fraudulent Conveyances and in Actions Against Directors by Creditors of Corporations, 32 Cornell L.Q. 222 (1946); Annos., 76 A.L.R. 864 (1932), 128 A.L.R. 1289 (1940), 133 A.L.R. 1311 (1941), 14 A.L.R.2d 598 (1950), and 100 A.L.R.2d 1094 (1965).  Together with § 6, this section should mitigate the uncertainty and diversity that have characterized the decisions applying statutes of limitations to actions to avoid transfers and obligations.  The periods prescribed apply, whether the action under this Act is brought by a creditor or by a purchaser at a sale on execution levied pursuant to § 7(b) and whether the action is brought against the original transferee or subsequent transferee.  The prescription of statutory periods of limitation does not preclude the barring of an avoidance action for laches.  See § 12 and the accompanying Comment.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9ol23">
       Subsection (a) provides that the four-year period ordinarily applicable to a claim for relief under § 4(a)(1) is extended to “one year after the transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant.” Antecedents to that “discovery rule” have long existed in common law and in other statutes, and courts may take different approaches to filling out the meaning of subsection (a) by reference to such precedents. Thus, subsection (a) literally starts the one-year period when the transfer was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant, but cases applying subsection (a) have held that the period starts only when the transfer and its wrongful nature were or could reasonably have been discovered. See, e.g., Freitag v. McGhie, 947 P.2d 1186 (Wash. 1997); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cordua, 834 F. Supp.2d 301, 306-08 (E.D. Pa. 2011). A recurring situation to which that distinction may be relevant is Spouse X’s transfer of assets beyond the reach of creditors, made in anticipation of divorcing Spouse Y after the four-year period has elapsed and made for the purpose of thwarting Spouse Y’s economic interests in the divorce. Spouse Y may well know of the transfer long before Spouse Y learns its wrongful purpose. Of course, even if the period specified in subsection (a) is held to have lapsed in a given case, law other than this Act might allow the transferred assets to be considered in making a division of assets in the ensuing divorce case.

      Editor’s Note. —
      <i>
       The North Carolina Comment below is the drafters’ comment to the State’s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act as enacted in 1997.
      </i>
     </p>
     <p>
      The UFTA’s limitations provisions make some change to the limitations period previously prescribed under North Carolina law.
   Under prior law, the limitations period applicable to fraudulent conveyances was three years and the limitations period began to run as of the time when the fraud was known or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party.
   <i>
    Cowart v. Whitley,
   </i>
   <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 664, 251 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1979).
     </p>
     <p>
      The UFTA provides for three limitations periods.
   As to transfers made with actual intent to defraud, there is a four year statute that accrues upon the date of transfer, but with a proviso that an aggrieved party shall have a minimum limitations period of one year from the date the transfer was or reasonably could have been discovered.
   As to claims based on a transfer in which the debtor does not receive reasonably equivalent value, the limitations period is four years from the date of transfer.
   The limitations period for a transfer to an insider in payment of an antecedent debt is one year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The introductory language of this section, which speaks in terms of a cause of action being “extinguished,” is intended to indicate that lapse of the statutory period bars the right as well as the remedy.
   Thus, the discovery rule of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(9) would not apply to claims within subsections (b) or (c), even if such claims were made under circumstances such that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(9) would otherwise apply.

       “Transfer” in G.S. 39-23.9, barring fraudulent transfer claims after a certain time, meant when a transfer occurred, not when fraud became apparent to a creditor, because the statute said the limitations period for all fraudulent transfer claims began at the time of a transfer, or when a claimant should reasonably have known of the fraud.

Although defendant later made several misleading statements about the character of that account, there was no provision in the UVTA statute of repose for tolling the running of the statute in the face of fraudulent conduct by the transferor except possibly where the transferor’s fraudulent conduct made it impossible for the plaintiff to discover the transfer, which was not the case here.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9Aol21">
       Section 10, added in 2014, is a simple and predictable choice of law rule applicable to claims for relief of the nature governed by the Act. It provides that a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under the Act is governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is “located” at the time the challenged transfer is made or the challenged obligation is incurred. “Local” law means the substantive law of the referenced jurisdiction, and not its choice of law rules. Section 6 determines the time at which a transfer is made or obligation is incurred for purposes of the Act, including this section. Section 10 applies equally to a candidate jurisdiction that is a sister state and to a candidate jurisdiction that is a foreign nation.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9Aol22">
       The choice of law rule set forth in § 10(b) applies to any claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act—in other words, any claim for relief sufficiently similar to a claim for relief under this Act as to warrant the application of this Act’s choice of law rule. “This Act” of course refers to the enactment of this Act that is in force in the jurisdiction whose enactment of § 10(b) is being applied. Section 10(b) could not properly have been written to apply merely to “a claim for relief under this Act,” for such a formulation would presuppose the applicability of the substantive provisions of this Act as in force in that jurisdiction. If a question should arise as to whether a given claim for relief is sufficiently similar to a claim for relief under this Act that § 10(b) should apply to it, tAs he answer is left to judicial determination.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9Aol23">
       As used in subsection (a), the terms “principal residence,” “place of business,” and “chief executive office” are to be evaluated on the basis of authentic and sustained activity, not on the basis of manipulations employed to establish a location artificially (e.g., by such means as establishing a notional “chief executive office” by use of straw-man officers or directors in a jurisdiction in which creditors’ rights are substantially debased, or establishing a notional “principal residence” for a short term in such a jurisdiction for the purpose of making an asset transfer while there). Notwithstanding the adaptation of subsection (a) from U.C.C. § 9-307(b) (2014), the foregoing terms need not necessarily have the same meanings in both statutes. Debtors are likely to have greater incentive and ability to employ “asset tourism” for the purpose of seeking to evade the substantive rules of this Act than for the purpose of seeking to manipulate the perfection and priority rules of secured transactions law. Interpretation and application of this Act should so recognize.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9Aol24">
       “Location” under this Act is completely independent from the concept of “center of main interests” (“COMI”), as that term is used in Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15, which applies to transnational insolvency proceedings, requires United States courts to defer in various ways to a foreign proceeding in the jurisdiction of the debtor’s COMI. Those consequences are quite different from the consequences of “location” under this Act. Furthermore, if the debtor is an organization, the debtor’s jurisdiction of organization has no bearing on the debtor’s “location” under subsection (a), by contrast to the presumption in Bankruptcy Code § 1516(c) (2014) that the jurisdiction in which the debtor has its registered office (i.e., its jurisdiction of organization) is its COMI.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.9Aol25">
       Section 10(b) determines the governing law only for a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act. Furthermore, this Act, like the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, has never purported to be an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See Comment 2 to § 15. Accordingly, the choice of law rule set forth in this § 10 is by no means applicable to all assertions that a transfer was made or an obligation incurred in contravention of law.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Basing choice of law on the location of the debtor is analogous to the rule set forth in U.C.C. § 9-301 (2014), which provides that the priority of a security interest in intangible property is generally governed by the local law of the jurisdiction in which the debtor is located. The analogy is apt, because the substantive rules of this Act are a species of priority rule, in that they determine the circumstances in which a debtor’s creditors, rather than the debtor’s transferee, have superior rights in property transferred by the debtor. In keeping with that analogy, the definition of the debtor’s “location” in subsection (a) is identical to the baseline definition of that term in U.C.C. § 9-307(b) (2014). Subsection (a) does not include any of the exceptions to the baseline definition that are set forth in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, such as U.C.C. § 9-307(e) (2014) (providing that the location of a domestic corporation or other “registered organization” is its jurisdiction of organization), and U.C.C. § 9-307(c) (2014) (providing in effect that if the baseline definition would locate a debtor in a jurisdiction that lacks an Article 9-style filing system, then the debtor is instead located in the District of Columbia). Those exceptions are not included in subsection (a) because their primary purpose relates to the operation of Article 9’s perfection rules, which have no analogue in this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, suppose that the principal residence of Spouse X is State A and the principal residence of Spouse Y is State B. Spouse Y, anticipating a future divorce, transfers assets to Transferee for the purpose of thwarting X’s economic interests in the divorce. Later a divorce action between X and Y is properly brought in the courts of State A, which has enacted this Act. Law other than this Act (presumably the family law of State A) will govern such matters as the classification of the transferred property as marital or separate and the remedies available against Y for wrongful dissipation of assets, such as awarding a larger share of marital property to X or imposing a lien on the separate property of Y. The choice of law rule set forth in § 10 does not apply to those matters, for they do not involve a claim for relief in the nature of a claim for relief under this Act. However, if Transferee is subject to personal jurisdiction in State A and X brings an action in State A against Transferee seeking avoidance of the transfer, or a money judgment against Transferee in lieu of avoidance, on the ground that the transfer had been made by Y with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud X, the choice of law rule set forth in § 10 would apply to that action, and as a result that action would be governed by the voidable transfer law of State B.

     <p>
      This section, added in 2014, accommodates developments in business organization statutes exemplified by the Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act §§ 401-404 (2009) and Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-215 (2012) (pertaining to Delaware limited liability companies). The definition of “series organization” in subsection (a)(2) is adapted from §§ 401-402 of the Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act. If the statute under which an organization is organized permits it to divide its assets and debts among “protected series” (however denominated), such that assets and debts of, or associated with, each “protected series” are separated in accordance with subsections (a)(2)(ii) and (iii), and if the organization does so, then the provisions of this Act apply to each “protected series” as if it were a legal entity, regardless of whether it is considered to be a legal entity for other purposes. The conditions referred to in subsections (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) are satisfied if the law under which the organization is organized so provides. It does not matter whether the separation of assets and debts described in subsections (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) would be respected by another jurisdiction in which the organization does business, or would be given effect by the Bankruptcy Code in the bankruptcy of the organization. An organization may be a “series organization” having “protected series,” as those terms are used in this section, even though the statute under which the organization is organized uses different terminology. This section uses the term “protected series,” which is not used in either the Uniform Statutory Trust Entity Act or the Delaware provisions cited above, to emphasize that the application of this section does not depend upon the terminology used by the applicable statute.
     </p>
     <p>
      The addition of this section to the Act does not imply any judgment about the desirability of legislation enabling the creation of protected series.

      This section is derived from § 11 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act and Uniform Commercial Code § 1-103 (1984) (later § 1-103(b) (2014)). The section adds a reference to “laches” in recognition of the particular appropriateness of the application of this equitable doctrine to an untimely action to avoid a transfer under this Act.

      According to the Official Comment to this section, the defense of laches (which does not appear in UCC § 1-103) has been specifically added to the UFTA “in recognition of the particular appropriateness of the application of this equitable doctrine to an untimely action to avoid a fraudulent transfer.”

      A uniformity provision such as this appears in over two dozen uniform acts adopted in North Carolina.

    See, e.g.,
   </i>
   N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-1-102(2)(c) (Uniform Commercial Code). The North Carolina courts have occasionally cited such a provision in connection with their construction of a uniform act.

       Official Comment (2014)

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.12ol11">
       The 2014 amendments change the short title of the Act from “Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act” to “Uniform Voidable Transactions Act.” The change of title is not intended to effect any change in the meaning of the Act. The retitling is not motivated by the substantive revisions made by the 2014 amendments, which are relatively minor. Rather, the word “Fraudulent” in the original title, though sanctioned by historical usage, was a misleading description of the Act as it was originally written. Fraud is not, and never has been, a necessary element of a claim for relief under the Act. The misleading intimation to the contrary in the original title of the Act led to confusion in the courts. See, e.g., § 4, Comment 10. The misleading insistence on “fraud” in the original title also contributed to the evolution of widely-used shorthand terminology that further tends to distort understanding of the provisions of the Act. Thus, several theories of recovery under the Act that have nothing whatever to do with fraud (or with intent of any sort) came to be widely known by the oxymoronic and confusing shorthand tag “constructive fraud.” See §§ 4(a)(2), 5(a). Likewise, the primordial theory of recovery under the Act, set forth in § 4(a)(1), came to be widely known by the shorthand tag “actual fraud.” That shorthand is misleading, because that provision does not in fact require proof of fraudulent intent. See § 4, Comment 8.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.12ol12">
       The Act, like the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, has never purported to be an exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations. See Prefatory Note (1984), ¶ 5; § 1, Comment 2, ¶ 6; § 4, Comment 9, ¶ 1; § 10, Comment 5. It remains the case that the Act is not the exclusive law on the subject of voidable transfers and obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.12ol13">
       The retitling of the Act should not be construed to affect references to the Act in other statutes or international instruments that use the former terminology. See, e.g., Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, art. 30(a)(3), opened for signature Nov. 16, 2001, S. Treaty Doc. No. 108-10 (referring to “any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a … transfer in fraud of creditors”).
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.12ol14">
       The 2014 amendments also make a correction to the text of the Act that is consonant with the change of the Act’s title. As originally written, the Act inconsistently used different words to denote a transfer or obligation for which the Act provides a remedy: sometimes “voidable” (see original § 2(d), §§ 8(a), (d), (e), (f)), and sometimes “fraudulent” (see original § 4(a), §§ 5(a), (b), § 9). The amendments resolve that inconsistency by using “voidable” consistently or deleting the word as unnecessary. No change in meaning is intended.
      </li>
      <li id="t39a3As39-23.12ol15">
       The Act does not address the extent to which a person who facilitates the making of a transfer or the incurrence of an obligation that is voidable under the Act may be subject to liability for that reason, whether under a theory of aiding and abetting, civil conspiracy, or otherwise. The Act leaves that subject to supplementary principles of law. See § 12. Cf. § 8(b)(1)(i) (imposing liability upon, inter alia, “the person for whose benefit the transfer was made”). Other law also governs such matters as (i) the circumstances in which a lawyer who assists a debtor in making a transfer or incurring an obligation that is voidable under the Act violates rules of professional conduct applicable to lawyers, (ii) the circumstances in which communications between the debtor and the lawyer in respect of such a transfer or obligation are excepted from attorney-client privilege, and (iii) the extent to which criminal sanctions apply to a debtor, transferee, obligee, or person who facilitates the making of a transfer or the incurrence of an obligation that is voidable under the Act. Neither the retitling of the Act, nor the consistent use of “voidable” in its text per Comment 4, effects any change in the meaning of the Act, and those amendments should not be construed to affect any of the foregoing matters.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In addition, the word “Transfer” in the original title of the Act was underinclusive, because the Act applies to incurrence of obligations as well as to transfers of property.

        Risk of Loss of Property Subject to Executory Contract. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The vendee in an executory contract for the sale of land holds an equitable interest therein. Absent inability of the vendor to convey, or express stipulation to the contrary, the risk of loss of property subject to such a contract falls on the vendee, who is treated as the equitable owner. In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 134, 298 S.E.2d 163, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3259 (1982).

        Risk of Loss Not Shifted to High Bidder Prior to Closing. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this Act the making of the high bid in a foreclosure sale does not operate to extinguish the seller’s interests and shift all risks to the purchaser. Sprouse v. North River Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 344 S.E.2d 555, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2313, writ denied, 347 S.E.2d 33, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2439 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this section shifts the risk of loss prior to closing to the high bidder. In fact, the high bidder cannot compel relinquishment of the premises until the price has been paid in full, and the mortgagor remains subject to personal liability on the note until then. Sprouse v. North River Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 344 S.E.2d 555, <cite class="nc_code">1986 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2313, writ denied, 347 S.E.2d 33, 1986 N.C. LEXIS 2439 (1986).

Any conveyance, encumbrance or other disposition thus made by any such business trust shall convey good and sufficient title to said real estate and interests therein in accordance with the provisions of said conveyance; provided, however, that with respect to any such conveyance, encumbrance or other disposition effected after June 28, 1977, there must be recorded in the county where the land lies a memorandum of the written instrument or declaration of trust referred to in G.S. 39-44. As a minimum such memorandum shall set forth the name, date and place of filing, if any, of such written instrument or declaration of trust, and the place where the written instrument or declaration of trust, and all amendments thereto, is kept and may be examined upon reasonable notice, which place need not be a public office.

This section is deemed to have been complied with if a resolution required by this subsection is recorded separately in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the land lies. Such a resolution shall be applicable to all instruments executed subsequently to the recording of the resolution and pursuant to its authority.Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section does not require a signed resolution adopted by the board of directors, as certified by an officer authorized to make such certifications, to be attached to an instrument or separately recorded in the case of an instrument duly executed by one of its trustees, its president, or a vice president of the business trust.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the trust agreement, and absent any provision otherwise in the recorded memorandum or declaration of trust required under subsection (a) of this section, when it appears on the face of an instrument registered in the office of the register of deeds that the instrument was signed in the ordinary course of business on behalf of a business trust by at least one of its trustees, its president, a vice president, or an assistant vice president, such an instrument shall be as valid with respect to the rights of innocent third parties for value without notice of a defect or breach of fiduciary duty as if executed pursuant to authorization from the board of trustees, unless the instrument reveals on its face a breach of fiduciary obligation.
