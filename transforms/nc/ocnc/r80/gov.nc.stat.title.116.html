                        The University of North Carolina is a public, multicampus university dedicated to the service of North Carolina and its people. It encompasses the 16 diverse constituent institutions and other educational, research, and public service organizations. Each
                        shares in the overall mission of the university. That mission is to discover, create, transmit, and apply knowledge to address the needs of individuals and society. This mission is accomplished through instruction, which communicates
                        the knowledge and values and imparts the skills necessary for individuals to lead responsible, productive, and personally satisfying lives; through research, scholarship, and creative activities, which advance knowledge and enhance
                        the educational process; and through public service, which contributes to the solution of societal problems and enriches the quality of life in the State. In the fulfillment of this mission, the university shall seek an efficient
                        use of available resources to ensure the highest quality in its service to the citizens of the State.Teaching and learning constitute the primary service that the university renders to society. Teaching, or instruction, is the
                        primary responsibility of each of the constituent institutions. The relative importance of research and public service, which enhance teaching and learning, varies among the constituent institutions, depending on their overall
                        missions.

                    “(2) The Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina (UNC) and the staff in the Office of the President are in agreement that The University of North Carolina must provide a mechanism by which talented faculty and staff within the UNC system
                    can move into administrative positions.

                <p>

                <p>
                    “(4) Historically, academic administrators moved into their positions directly from the faculty, but the complexities of leadership make such changes nearly impossible today.

                    University of North Carolina is too low. The General Assembly further finds that it is important to design and implement a program for the purpose of achieving the following goals: to assist more students to obtain a baccalaureate
                    degree within a shorter time period; to provide students with a college education at significantly lower costs for both the student and the State; to help decrease the amount of debt resulting from loans that a student may owe upon
                    graduation; to provide a student with an interim degree that may increase a student’s job opportunities if the student chooses not to continue postsecondary education; and to provide easier access to academic counseling that will assist
                    a student in selecting coursework that reflects the student’s educational and career goals and helps the student succeed academically.

                    identified as academically at risk and designed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, would address the issues and help achieve the goals set out in subsection (a) of this section. In its study the Board of Governors and State
                    Board of Community Colleges shall also consider the best procedure for implementing NCGAP and the fiscal impact it may have with respect to enrollment.

                    “By January 1, 2017, the President of The University of North Carolina, in consultation with the Board of Governors, shall adopt a plan to improve student completion of baccalaureate degrees that includes specific targets for each constituent institution’s
                    completion rates and that is effective for the 2017-2018 academic year. For the purposes of this section, “completion rates” may include the four and six year graduation rate of first-time, full-time freshman or other methods of measuring
                    completion that may more accurately capture the success of each institution’s undergraduate population. The plan shall allow for a variety of strategies designed to best meet the individual constituent institutions’ needs, such as,
                    but not limited to: redesigned courses, early alerts systems, tutoring, degree mapping, and innovative merit-based completion incentives.

                    in a community college in this State and earn an associate degree prior to enrolling as a student at the constituent institution. A student who earns an associate degree from a community college in this State within three years from
                    the date of the deferred acceptance is guaranteed admission at that constituent institution to complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree. A constituent institution shall hold in reserve an enrollment slot in the appropriate
                    future academic year for any student who accepts a deferred admission. A constituent institution shall also reduce its enrollment for each academic year by the number of deferred admissions granted for that academic year.

                    design a deferred admission program as part of NCGAP for implementation at the institution. The institution shall design the program so that it may be implemented at the institution beginning with the 2017-2018 fiscal year and applied

                    Session Laws 2001-424, s. 31.2(a)-(c), provides: “(a) The Southern Regional Education Board currently operates an Academic Common Market program. Under this program, qualified students from participating states may apply to attend programs at public universities
                    in participating states that are not available in their home state’s university system. North Carolina’s participation for graduate programs would provide a cost-effective means of offering educational access for North Carolina residents.
                    North Carolinians would be able to attend graduate programs that are not available at The University of North Carolina at reduced rates, and the State would avoid the cost associated with the development of new academic programs.

                <p>
                    “(b) The Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina may establish a pilot program for participation in the Southern Regional Education Board’s Academic Common Market at the graduate program level. The Board of Governors shall examine the graduate
                    programs offered in The University of North Carolina system and select for participation only those graduate programs that are likely to be unique or are not commonly available in other Southern Regional Education Board states. Out-of-state
                    tuition shall be waived for students who are residents of other Southern Regional Education Board states and who are participating in the Academic Common Market program. If accepted into The University of North Carolina graduate programs
                    that are part of the Academic Common Market, these students shall pay in-State tuition and shall be treated for all purposes of The University of North Carolina as residents of North Carolina. Prior to the beginning of this pilot,
                    the Board of Governors shall submit its list of graduate programs selected to be a part of the pilot program to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee.
                </p>

                    “(c) The pilot programs established under this section [s. 31.2 of Session Laws 2001-424] shall terminate July 1, 2005. However, once a student is enrolled in The University of North Carolina system under the Academic Common Market program, the student
                    shall be entitled to pay in-State tuition as long as the student is enrolled in that graduate program. The Board of Governors shall report the success of the Academic Common Market program to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight
                    Committee by December 31, 2003, and by January 31, 2005, and the Committee may recommend changes, if any are appropriate, to the pilot program at either of those times.”

                    the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years. This increase shall be in addition to other increases authorized for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 fiscal years. At least twenty percent (20%) of these funds shall be used to provide need-based

                    institution. A student admitted to a constituent institution through NC GAP must agree to defer enrollment at the institution until the student earns an associate degree from one of the State’s community colleges. Counseling and assistance
                    shall be provided by the community college to any student in NC GAP to help the student in selecting coursework that reflects the student’s educational and career goals and that provides a smooth transition from the community college

                        its own courts, it lacks any indication that North Carolina has consented to suit in federal court. The provision, correctly construed, does no more than allow UNC and its constituent institutions to sue and be sued in their own

                        The University of North Carolina is, by definition, one State agency, not 16 separate, independent agencies. The statute constitutes the Board of Governors of UNC as a body politic and corporate. This section does not grant this status to any of the 16

                        Individual campuses enjoy a substantial measure of autonomy; they operate largely free from control of the Board of Governors. On a day-to-day basis, operations of campuses are determined primarily by their respective chancellors and boards of trustees.
                        This is true, however, because of the independence that the Board has allowed the campuses, and not because of any autonomy with which they are inherently endowed under relevant statutes. Board of Governors v. United States Dep't

                        which nonresidents may obtain its water. In exerting this authority, it may fix a different rate from that charged within the corporate limits. The defendant, having accepted these services for almost half a century is not now
                        in a position to complain about the rates. University of N.C. v. Town of Carrboro, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 190 S.E.2d 231, <cite class="nc_code">1972 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1949, cert.

                        In a case involving injury to personal property, an information was fatally flawed because it failed to show that each owner of property was capable of owing property; even though a state university was a body politic and corporate authorized to own property,
                        there was no showing that the other entity was capable of such. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 763 S.E.2d 574, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1043 (2014),

                        Administrative Procedure Act (APA) applied to an employee’s breach of employment contract claim against North Carolina Central University (University), requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, because (1) the employee’s use of a contractual internal
                        appeal process and inability to use the State Personnel Act showed no lack of such remedies, as the University’s decisions were reviewable under G.S. 150B-43, (2) the employee’s contract did not exempt the employee from the APA,
                        (3) the University did not waive sovereign immunity, and (4) the unavailability of breach of contract damages under the APA did not make such review inadequate. Frazier v.

                        In a case involving injury to personal property, an information was fatally flawed because it failed to show that each owner of property was capable of owing property; even though a state university was a body politic and corporate authorized to own property,
                        there was no showing that the other entity was capable of such. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 763 S.E.2d 574, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1043 (2014),

                    in a medical residency program. The Board shall also forgive the loan if it finds that it is impossible for the recipient to practice medicine in North Carolina for four years, within seven years after graduation, because of the death
                    or permanent disability of the recipient. All unused funds appropriated to or otherwise received by the Board for scholarships, all funds received as repayment of scholarship loans, and all interest earned on these funds shall revert

                    Session Laws 2013-360, s. 11.17(a), (b), as amended by Session Laws 2013-363, s. 3.16, provides: “(a) The Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee, in conjunction with the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina and the State Board
                    of Community Colleges, shall study the feasibility of establishing an alternative undergraduate admission program to be known as the North Carolina Guaranteed Admission Program (NC GAP). The goals of NC GAP shall be to encourage and
                    assist more students to obtain a baccalaureate degree within a shorter time period; to provide students with a college education at significantly lower costs for both the student and the State; to help decrease the amount of debt resulting
                    from loans that a student may owe upon graduation; to provide a student with an interim degree that may increase a student’s job opportunities if the student chooses not to continue postsecondary education; and to provide easier access
                    to academic counseling that will assist a student in selecting coursework that reflects the student’s educational and career goals and helps the student succeed academically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “NC GAP shall be designed as an alternative admission program for students who apply for admission to a constituent institution and satisfy the admission criteria but whose academic credentials are not as competitive as other students admitted to the
                    institution. A student admitted to a constituent institution through NC GAP must agree to defer enrollment at the institution until the student earns an associate degree from one of the State’s community colleges. Counseling and assistance
                    shall be provided by the community college to any student in NC GAP to help the student in selecting coursework that reflects the student’s educational and career goals and that provides a smooth transition from the community college
                    to the constituent institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Once awarded the associate degree from the community college, the student is entitled to admission as a junior at the constituent institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Each constituent institution of higher education would be directed to establish NC GAP as part of its undergraduate admission program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(b) The Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee shall report its findings and recommendations regarding NC GAP, together with any recommended legislation, to the 2014 Regular Session of the 2013 General Assembly, upon its convening. The report
                    shall include a comprehensive description of the proposed program, including the criteria that would be used to determine which students would be required to participate in the program as a condition of enrollment and the academic
                    counseling that would need to be available to help students in NC GAP succeed academically.”

                        Powers of planning and coordination of a system of higher education in North Carolina, granted to the Board in a number of subsections of this section, each of which deals with a specific power, are expressly relative to the Board’s governance of the
                        constituent institutions of The University of North Carolina. Nova Univ. v. Board of Governors, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 156</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 872, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1261 (1982).

        Board of Governors’ Power to Control Campuses. —

                    <p>
                        Delegation of Board’s power to campuses does not deprive the Board of control over campuses’ activity with which the delegation is connected. Instead, the statute provides that “any delegation of authority may be rescinded by the Board at any time in
                        whole or in part.” The statute also provides that the chancellor of each campus acts “subject to the direction of the President.” Regardless of any authority that the Board of Governors may have delegated to the constituent campuses
                        of UNC, the Board retains ultimate control over the campuses’ activity through its unlimited power to rescind any delegation. Board of Governors v. United States Dep't of Labor, 917 F.2d 812, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 18811 (4th Cir.
                        1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 916, 111 S. Ct. 2013, 114 L. Ed. 2d 100, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 2546 (1991).

                        Individual campuses enjoy a substantial measure of autonomy; they operate largely free from control of the Board of Governors. On a day-to-day basis, operations of campuses are determined primarily by their respective chancellors and boards of trustees.
                        This is true, however, because of the independence that the board has allowed the campuses, and not because of any autonomy with which they are inherently endowed under the relevant statutes. Board of Governors v. United States

                <p>
                    The Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina, acting on recommendation made by the President of The University of North Carolina after consultation by him with the State Auditor, may designate one or more constituent institutions of The
                    University as special responsibility constituent institutions. That designation shall be based on an express finding by the Board of Governors that each institution to be so designated has the management staff and internal financial
                    controls that will enable it to administer competently and responsibly all additional management authority and discretion to be delegated to it. The Board of Governors, on recommendation of the President, shall adopt rules prescribing
                    management staffing standards and internal financial controls and safeguards, including the lack of any significant findings in the annual financial audit by the State Auditor’s Office, that must be met by a constituent institution
                    before it may be designated a special responsibility constituent institution and must be maintained in order for it to retain that designation. These rules shall not be designed to prohibit participation by a constituent institution
                    because of its size. These rules shall establish procedures for the President and his staff to review the annual financial audit reports, special reports, electronic data processing reports, performance reports, management letters,
                    or any other report issued by the State Auditor’s Office for each special responsibility constituent institution. The President shall take immediate action regarding reported weaknesses in the internal control structure, deficiencies
                    in the accounting records, and noncompliance with rules and regulations. In any instance where significant findings are identified, the President shall notify the Chancellor of the particular special responsibility constituent institution
                    that the institution must make satisfactory progress in resolving the findings, as determined by the President of The University, after consultation with the State Auditor, within a three-month period commencing with the date of receipt
                    of the published financial audit report, any other audit report, or management letter. If satisfactory progress is not made within a three-month period, the President of The University shall recommend to the Board of Governors at its
                    next meeting that the designation of the particular institution as a special responsibility constituent institution be terminated until such time as the exceptions are resolved to the satisfaction of the President of The University
                    of North Carolina, after consultation with the State Auditor. However, once the designation as a special responsibility constituent institution has been withdrawn by the Board of Governors, reinstatement may not be effective until
                    the beginning of the following fiscal year at the earliest. Any actions taken by the Board of Governors with respect to withdrawal or reinstatement of an institution’s status as a special responsibility constituent institution shall
                    be reported immediately to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules established under this section shall include review by the President, after consultation with the State Auditor, the Director of the Office of State Human Resources, and the Director of the Division of State Purchasing and Contracts in ascertaining
                    whether or not a constituent institution has the management staff and internal financial controls to administer the additional authorities authorized under G.S. 116-30.2, 116-30.4, and 143-53.1. Such review and consultation must take
                    place no less frequently than once each biennium.

                        the cost of an education at the several UNC campuses as low as possible; because G.S. 116-33 advances this remedial purpose, the statute is constitutional under N.C. Const., Art. IX, § 9, which is a co-equal provision with N.C.

                        Delegation of the Board’s power to campuses does not deprive the Board of control over the campuses’ activity with which the delegation is connected. Instead, the statute provides that “any delegation of authority may be rescinded by the Board at any

                        campuses of UNC, the Board retains ultimate control over the campuses’ activity through its unlimited power to rescind any delegation. Board of Governors v. United States Dep't of Labor, 917 F.2d 812, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 18811

                <p>
                    The preamble to Session Laws 2005-153, provides: “Whereas, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke was originally established in 1887 as Croatan Normal School in response to a petition from the American Indian people in the Robeson County area; and

                <p>

                </p>

                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bonds of the University for the purpose of undertaking and carrying out any project or projects hereunder; provided,
                    however, that the aggregate principal amount of revenue bonds which the Board is authorized to issue under this section during the biennium ending June 30, 1969, shall not exceed three million five hundred thousand dollars ($3,500,000);
                    provided, further, the Board shall have authority to issue revenue bonds under this section in an additional aggregate principal amount not to exceed three million five hundred thousand dollars ($3,500,000) during the biennium ending
                    June 30, 1971; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of revenue bonds which the Board is authorized to issue under this section during the biennium ending June 30, 1973, shall not exceed thirteen million dollars ($13,000,000);
                    provided, further, that the aggregate principal amount of revenue bonds which the Board is authorized to issue under this section during the biennium ending June 30, 1975, shall not exceed thirteen million dollars ($13,000,000). The
                    bonds shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 30 years from their date or dates, and shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity at
                    the option of the Board at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds, and any interest
                    coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case
                    any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient
                    for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Part or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this Part, all such bonds shall be
                    deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal
                    alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, at public or private sale, and for
                    such price, as it may determine to be for the best interests of the University.

                <p>
                    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing
                    the issuance of such bonds. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution, if the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such costs, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to
                    provide the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose.

                <p>
                    The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the Board may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued under such restrictions and limitations
                    as may be prescribed by such resolution.

                <p>
                    Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for
                    delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonds may be issued by the Board under the provisions of this Part, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, but without obtaining the consent of any other commission, board, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceedings
                    or the happening of any other conditions or things than those consents, proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this Part.

                <p>
                    Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Part shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of North Carolina or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor

                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bond anticipation notes of the Board in anticipation of the issuance of bonds authorized pursuant to the provisions
                    of this Part. The principal of and the interest on such notes shall be payable solely from the proceeds of bonds or renewal notes or, in the event bond or renewal note proceeds are not available, any available revenues of the project
                    or projects for which such bonds shall have been authorized. The notes of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding two years from their date or dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as
                    may be determined by the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity,
                    at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the notes. The Board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the notes, including
                    any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the notes and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the
                    State. In case any officer, whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any notes or coupons, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such notes, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless
                    be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Part or any recitals in any notes issued under the provisions of this Part,
                    all such notes shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State. The notes may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any
                    coupon notes as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon notes of any notes registered as to both principal and interest. The Board may sell such notes in such manner, at public
                    or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be for the best interests of the University.

                    The proceeds of the notes of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which the bonds in anticipation of which such notes are being issued shall have been authorized, and such note proceeds shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions,
                    if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such notes or bonds.

                    The Board in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds under this Part may provide for a pledge to the payment of such revenue bonds and the interest thereon of the revenue derived from the project and also for a pledge of the revenues derived
                    from any system, facility, plant, works, instrumentalities or properties improved, bettered, or extended by the project or otherwise within the jurisdiction of or operated by the University in connection with the University of North
                    Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the revenues derived from any future improvements, betterments or extensions of the project, the revenues derived from the University Enterprises, or any part thereof, or the revenues from the
                    project and any or all of the revenues mentioned in this sentence, without regard to whether the operations involved are deemed governmental or proprietary, it being the purpose hereof to vest in the Board broad powers which shall
                    be liberally construed. So long as any revenues of the University mentioned in this paragraph are pledged for the payment of the principal of or interest on any bonds issued hereunder, such revenues shall be deposited in a special
                    fund and shall be applied and used only as provided in the resolution authorizing such bonds, subject, however, to any prior pledge or encumbrance thereof.

                <p>
                    The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the holders of the bonds, including covenants setting forth the duties of the University in relation to the construction
                    of any project to be financed with the proceeds of said bonds, and to the maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of such project or any other project, systems, facilities, plants, works, instrumentalities, properties, the University
                    Enterprises or any part thereof, if the revenues thereof are in any way pledged as security for the bonds; the fixing and revising of service charges and the collection thereof; and the custody, safeguarding and application of all
                    moneys of the University pertaining to the project and the bonds, and all revenues pledged therefor. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the Board may carry insurance on any such project in such amounts and covering such
                    risks as it may deem advisable. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying
                    bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Such resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. Such resolution may contain
                    such other provisions in addition to the foregoing as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

                    The Board may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and any revenues pledged therefor to such officer, board or depositary as it may designate for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and
                    restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of operation.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly of North Carolina recognizes that the public university system would be greatly strengthened by the addition of distinguished scholars. It further recognizes that private as well as State support is preferred in helping to obtain
                    distinguished scholars for the State universities and that private support will help strengthen the commitment of citizens and organizations in promoting excellence throughout all State universities. It is the intent of the General
                    Assembly to establish a trust fund to provide the opportunity to each State university to receive and match challenge grants to create endowments for selected distinguished professors to occupy chairs within the university. The associated
                    foundations that serve the universities shall solicit and receive gifts from private sources to provide for matching funds to the trust fund challenge grants for the establishment of endowments for chairs within universities.

                        Because the North Carolina General Assembly enacted G.S. 116-44.4 pursuant to a clear grant of constitutional authority to establish a mechanism for administering the “maintenance and management” of traffic and parking on each University of North Carolina
                        campus, G.S. 116-44.4 is constitutional under N.C. Const., Art. IX, § 8, which is a co-equal provision with N.C. Const., Art. IX, § 7. N.C. Sch. Bds. Ass'n v.

                    <p>
                        Proceeds of penalties that are collected for violation of campus traffic and parking ordinances as “infractions” under G.S. 116-44.4(g) are subject to N.C. Const., Art. IX, § 7. N.C. Sch. Bds. Ass'n v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite>                        253, 585 S.E.2d 418, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C.

                    the person upon receipt of the original scholarship loan awarded to the person under G.S. 116-74.42. Exclusive of any deferment for extenuating circumstances, a person remains eligible for the optional six-month scholarship for two

                    for evaluating a scholarship recipient’s work performance and for issuing a final approval and certification of the work performance. The Commission shall transfer to the State Education Assistance Authority the name of each recipient
                    that it certifies as successfully completing the optional scholarship program. The State Education Assistance Authority shall pay the twenty thousand dollar ($20,000) scholarship to the scholarship recipient within a reasonable time

                        relevant information or change in the circumstances pertaining to the recipient impacting the enforcement of the promissory note. A forgivable scholarship loan shall also be forgiven if the Commission finds it is impossible for

                    Session Laws 1997-443, s. 10.21, provides that the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina may set tuition rates for students in the Masters of Business Administration and the Masters of Accounting programs of the School of Business at
                    the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that are higher than those currently set pursuant to G.S. 116-143. The Board of Governors is also to conduct a study of tuition levels and adjust tuition rates to align with policies
                    on tuition differentials, and report to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee by January 15, 1999, regarding the findings of its study.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 1997-443, s. 35.2, provides: “Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 1997-99 fiscal biennium, the textual provisions of this act apply only to funds appropriated for,
                    and activities occurring during, the 1997-99 fiscal biennium.”

                    Session Laws 2016-23, s. 7(a)-(d), provides: “(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, independent persons and their dependents formerly domiciled in North Carolina counties who are domiciled in South Carolina counties as a result of the North
                    Carolina-South Carolina boundary certification may be considered eligible for in-State tuition rates for a period of up to 10 years from the effective date of the boundary change. To be eligible for in-State tuition rates, such persons
                    must have been domiciled and reside on property in North Carolina in accordance with G.S. 116-143.1 immediately prior to the effective date of North Carolina legislation approving the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary certification
                    and must maintain residence and domicile on that same property within South Carolina.

                    for a period of two years from the effective date of the boundary certification, be eligible for in-State rates without the requirement of residency and domicile for 12 months in this State provided such independent persons have evidenced
                    the intent to establish domicile in North Carolina in accordance with G.S. 116-143.1. To be eligible under this provision, such persons must reside on the same property that was in South Carolina immediately prior to the effective
                    date of North Carolina legislation approving the certified North Carolina-South Carolina boundary. To maintain eligibility for in-State tuition rates longer than the two years permitted under this paragraph, the independent persons
                    and their dependents must satisfy the requirements of G.S. 116-143.1.

                    “(c) The provisions established under subsections (a) and (b) of this section are not transferable to persons other than those independent persons and their dependents falling within the scope of those provisions.

                <p>
                    “(d) Should the domicile and residence of independent persons and their dependents change from the property affected by the boundary certification, maintenance of eligibility for in-State rates will be determined as provided in G.S. 116-143.1.”

    Issuance of bonds.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bonds of the Board for the purpose of acquiring or constructing any project or projects. The bonds of each issue
                    shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 50 years from their date or dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of
                    the Board, at such price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons
                    to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer
                    whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
                    all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Article or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this Article, all such bonds shall be
                    deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal
                    alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, at public or private sale, and for
                    such price, as it may determine to be in the best interest of the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing
                    the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, if the proceeds of such bonds, by
                    error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the
                    same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds, and any trust agreement securing such bonds, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the Board may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued
                    under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for
                    delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonds may be issued by the Board under the provisions of this Article, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, but without obtaining the consent of any other commission, board, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceedings
                    or the happening of any other conditions or things than those consents, proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this Article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of North Carolina or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided therefor
                    and a statement to that effect shall be recited on the face of the bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Board may enter into or negotiate a note with an acceptable bank or trust company in lieu of issuing bonds for the financing of projects covered under this Article. The terms and conditions of any note of this nature shall be in accordance with the
                    terms and conditions surrounding issuance of bonds.

                    In the discretion of the Board and subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, each or any issue of revenue bonds may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Board and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having
                    the powers of a trust company within or without the State. The resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or such trust agreement may pledge to the extent necessary the revenues to be received from any project or projects at
                    any institution and from any similar existing facilities described in G.S. 116-175(4) at the same institution, in excess of amounts now charged to each occupant of such project, but shall not convey or mortgage any such project or
                    existing facilities, and may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties
                    of the Board in relation to the acquisition or construction of such project or projects and in relation to the maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of such project or projects and such existing facilities, the fixing and revising
                    of rentals and other charges; and, the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and for the employment of consulting engineers or architects in connection with such acquisition, construction or operation. Notwithstanding
                    the provisions of any other law the Board may carry insurance on any such project or projects in such amounts and covering such risks as it may deem advisable. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the
                    laws of the State of North Carolina which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Such resolution or trust agreement
                    may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustees, if any, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. Such resolution or trust agreement may contain such other provisions in addition

                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bonds of the Board for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring, constructing or providing
                    any project or projects. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 50 years from their date or dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, and may
                    be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and manner of
                    execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust
                    company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such
                    facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Article or any recitals in any bonds issued under
                    the provisions of this Article, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State, subject only to the provisions for registration in any resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any
                    trust agreement securing the same. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both
                    principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine
                    to be for the best interests of the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing
                    the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, if the proceeds of such bonds, by
                    error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the
                    same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds, and any trust agreement securing such bonds, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the Board may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued
                    under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement.

                <p>
                    Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for
                    delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.

                    of this Article. The principal of and the interest on such notes shall be payable solely from the proceeds of bonds or renewal notes or, in the event bond or renewal note proceeds are not available, any available revenues of the project
                    or projects for which such bonds shall have been authorized. The notes of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding two years from their date or dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as
                    may be determined by the Board, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the notes. The Board
                    shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the notes, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the notes and the place or places of payment of principal
                    and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer, whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any notes or coupons, shall cease to be such officer before
                    the delivery of such notes, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this

                    In the discretion of the Board and subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, any revenue bonds issued under this Article may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Board and a corporate trustee (or trustees) which may be any trust
                    company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey
                    or mortgage any project or projects or any existing facilities or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and
                    remedies of the holders of such bonds as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Board in relation to the acquisition, construction or provision of any project or
                    projects, the maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of any project or projects and any existing facilities, student fees and admission fees and charges and other fees, rents and charges to be fixed and collected, and the custody,
                    safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds
                    or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the holders of the bonds and the rights, remedies and immunities of the trustee or trustees,
                    if any, and may restrict the individual right of action by such holders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security
                    of such holders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the project or projects for which such bonds are issued or as an expense of operation
                    of such project or projects, as the case may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Article, whether as proceeds from the sale of bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Article. The Board may provide for the payment
                    of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues, or part thereof, to such officer, board or depositary as it may designate for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions
                    as it may determine. Any officer with whom, or any bank or trust company with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject to such requirements
                    as are provided in this Article and in the resolution or trust agreement authorizing or securing such bonds.

                    For the purpose of aiding in the acquisition, construction or provision of any project and the maintenance, repair and operation of any project or any existing facilities, the Board is authorized to fix, revise from time to time, charge and collect from
                    students enrolled at the institution under its jurisdiction such student fee or fees for such privileges and services and in such amount or amounts as the Board shall determine, and to fix, revise from time to time, charge and collect
                    other fees, rents and charges for the use of and for the services furnished or to be furnished by any project or projects and any existing facilities, or any portion thereof, and admission fees for athletic games and other public events,
                    and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation for the lease, use, occupancy or operation of, or for concessions in, any project or projects and any existing facilities, or any part thereof, and to fix the
                    terms, conditions, fees, rents and charges for any such lease, use, occupancy, operation or concession. So long as bonds issued hereunder and payable therefrom are outstanding, such fees, rents and charges shall be so fixed and adjusted,
                    with relation to other revenues available therefor, as to provide funds pursuant to the requirements of the resolution or trust agreement authorizing or securing such bonds at least sufficient with such other revenues, if any, (i)
                    to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating any project or projects and any existing facilities any part of the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of the bonds issued for such project or projects, (ii) to pay
                    the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (iii) to create and maintain reserves for such purposes. Such fees, rents and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by
                    any other commission, board, bureau or agency of the State. A sufficient amount of the revenues, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide such reserves therefor
                    and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular
                    intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and
                    the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made, the fees, rents and charges and other revenues or other
                    moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Board shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against
                    all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed
                    or recorded except in the records of the Board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of the trust agreement

    Issuance of bonds and bond anticipation notes.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bonds of the Board for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, or providing
                    any project or projects on the Centennial Campus, on the Horace Williams Campus, or on a Millennial Campus. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates,
                    shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the Board, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board
                    prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the
                    place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons
                    shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding
                    any of the other provisions of this Article or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this Article, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State, subject only to the provisions
                    for registration in any resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any trust agreement securing the same. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both or as book-entry bonds, as the Board may determine, and
                    provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest.
                    The Board may sell such bonds in such manner, at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing
                    the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, if the proceeds of such bonds, by
                    error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the
                    same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds, and any trust agreement securing such bonds, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional revenue bonds as the Board may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued
                    under such restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for
                    delivery. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.

                    Except as herein otherwise provided, bonds may be issued under this Article and other powers vested in the Board under this Article may be exercised by the Board without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or
                    agency of the State and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by this Article.

                    The Board may enter into or negotiate a note with an acceptable bank or trust company in lieu of issuing bonds for the financing of projects covered under this section. The terms and conditions of any note of this nature shall be in accordance with the
                    terms and conditions surrounding issuance of bonds.

                <p>
                    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, at one time or from time to time, revenue bond anticipation notes of the Board in anticipation of the issuance of bonds authorized pursuant to the provisions
                    of this Article. The principal of and the interest on such notes shall be payable solely from the proceeds of bonds or renewal notes, or, in the event bond or renewal note proceeds are not available, any available revenues of the project
                    or projects for which such bonds shall have been authorized. The notes of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding two years from their date or dates, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as
                    may be determined by the Board, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the notes. The Board
                    shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the notes, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the notes and the place or places of payment of principal
                    and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any notes or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the
                    delivery of such notes, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this
                    Article or any recitals in any notes issued under the provisions of this Article, all such notes shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of this State, subject only to the provisions for registration in any resolution
                    authorizing the issuance of such notes or any trust agreement securing the bonds in anticipation of which such notes are being issued. The notes may be issued in coupon or registered form or both or as book entry notes, as the Board
                    may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon notes as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon notes of any notes registered as to both principal

                    if any, as the Board may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such notes or bonds or in the trust agreement securing such bonds.

                <p>
                    In the discretion of the Board and subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, any revenue bonds issued under this Article may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Board and a corporate trustee (or trustees) which may be any trust
                    company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received but shall not convey
                    or mortgage any project or projects or any existing facilities or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and
                    remedies of the holders of such bonds as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Board in relation to the acquisition, construction, or provision of any project
                    or projects, the maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of any project or projects and any existing facilities, student fees and admission fees and charges, and other fees, rents, and charges to be fixed and collected, and the
                    custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or revenues to furnish such indemnifying
                    bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the holders of the bonds and the rights, remedies, and immunities of the trustee or
                    trustees, if any, and may restrict the individual right of action by such holders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for
                    the security of such holders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the project or projects for which such bonds are issued or as an expense
                    of operation of such project or projects, as the case may be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proceeds of all bonds issued and all revenues and other moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Article shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Article. The Board may provide for the payment of
                    the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues, or part thereof, to such officer, board, or depositary as it may designate for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions
                    as it may determine. Any officer with whom, or any bank, trust company, or fiscal agent with which, such moneys shall be deposited shall act as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same for the purposes hereof, subject
                    to such requirements as are provided in this Article and in the resolution or trust agreement authorizing or securing such bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the Board may carry insurance on any project or projects and any existing facilities in such amounts and covering such risks as it may deem advisable.

                <p>
                    Any holder of bonds issued under this Article or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee or trustees under any trust agreement, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by such trust agreement or the resolution
                    authorizing the issuance of such bonds, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State or granted hereunder or under such trust agreement
                    or resolution, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this Article or by such trust agreement or resolution to be performed by the Board or by any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting
                    of fees, rents, and charges.

                    For the purpose of aiding in the acquisition, construction, or provision of any project and the maintenance, repair, and operation of any project or any existing facilities, the Board is authorized to fix, revise from time to time, charge, and collect
                    such fee or fees for such privileges and services and in such amount or amounts as the Board shall determine, and to fix, revise from time to time, charge, and collect other fees, rents, and charges for the use of and for the services
                    furnished or to be furnished by any project or projects and any existing facilities, or any portion thereof, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation for the lease, use, occupancy, or operation of any
                    project or projects and any existing facilities, or any part thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, fees, rents, and charges for any such lease, use, occupancy, or operation. So long as bonds issued hereunder and payable therefrom
                    are outstanding, such fees, rents, and charges shall be so fixed and adjusted, with relation to other revenues available therefor, as to provide funds pursuant to the requirements of the resolution or trust agreement authorizing or
                    securing such bonds at least sufficient with such other revenues, if any, (i) to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating any project or projects and any existing facilities any part of the revenues of which are pledged
                    to the payment of the bonds issued for such project or projects, (ii) to pay the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and (iii) to create and maintain reserves for such purposes. Any
                    surplus funds remaining after application to the purposes mentioned in (i), (ii), and (iii), above, shall be held in trust and applied by the Board to the development of the Centennial Campus, the Horace Williams Campus, or a Millennial
                    Campus, as applicable. Such fees, rents, and charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau, or agency of the State. A sufficient amount of the revenues, except such part thereof as
                    may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor and for renewals, replacements, extensions, enlargements, and improvements as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing
                    the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to and charged
                    with the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and
                    binding from the time when the pledge is made; the fees, rents, and charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Board shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical
                    delivery thereof or further act; and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Board, irrespective of whether such parties have
                    notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Board. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be

                        The purpose of this Article is to authorize a system of financial assistance, consisting of grants, loans, work-study or other employment, and other aids, to assist qualified students to enable them to obtain an education beyond the high school level
                        by attending public or private educational institutions. The General Assembly has found and hereby declares that it is in the public interest and essential to the welfare and well-being of the State and to the proper growth and
                        development of the State to foster and provide financial assistance to properly qualified students in order to help them to obtain an education beyond the high school level. The General Assembly has further found that many students
                        who are fully qualified to enroll in appropriate educational institutions for furthering their education beyond the high school level lack the financial means and are unable, without financial assistance as authorized under this
                        Article, to pay the cost of such education, with a consequent irreparable loss to the State of valuable talents vital to its welfare. The General Assembly has determined that the establishment of a proper system of financial assistance
                        for such objective purpose serves a public purpose and is fully consistent with the long established policy of the State to encourage, promote and assist education to enhance economic development.

                        Since issuance of tax-exempt revenue bonds by the State Education Assistance Authority for purpose of financing loans to college students does not pledge the credit of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, a taxpayer can suffer no injury
                        from the issuance of the bonds and has no interest therein except his general interest as a member of the public in good government pursuant to the North Carolina Constitution, and, consequently, a taxpayer has no standing to seek
                        an injunction restraining actions of the Authority and its fiscal agent relating to the issuance of the bonds and the expenditure of the proceeds thereof. Nicholson v. State Educ. Assistance Auth.,

                        It is implicit in the provisions of G.S. 116-209.1 to 116-209.15 that the General Assembly contemplated and intended that no loans would be made from the proceeds from the sale of tax-exempt revenue bonds except student loans made in compliance with the

                        the Authority and render it unable to qualify from time to time for the federal assistance upon which its program depended. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>,

                        The State Education Assistance Authority has the authority to create and administer an institutional, student loan program under which the authority would advance funds from the North Carolina Student Loan Fund to qualified institutions to enable those
                        institutions to make Federal Family Education Loans, under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, directly to and for the convenience of their graduate and professional students. See opinion of Attorney General to Steven

       § 116-209.4.
    Authority to issue bonds.
      </b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Authority is hereby authorized to provide for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the Authority in such principal amounts as the Board of Directors shall determine to be necessary. The bonds shall be designated, subject
                    to such additions or changes as the Authority deems advisable, “State Education Assistance Authority Revenue Bonds, Series _______________ ,” inserting in the blank space a letter identifying the particular series of bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding
                    30 years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the
                    Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive
                    bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. The Authority shall determine
                    the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which
                    may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such
                    bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The Authority may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by
                    a fiscal agent. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal
                    and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at
                    public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effectuate the purposes of this Article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Authority is authorized to provide in any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds for pledging or assigning as security for its revenue bonds, subject to any prior pledge or assignment, and for deposit to the credit of the sinking fund, any or
                    all of its income, receipts, funds or other assets, exclusive of bond proceeds and other funds required to be deposited to the credit of the Loan Fund, of whatsoever kind from time to time acquired or owned by the Authority, including
                    all donations, grants and other money or property made available to it, payments received on student loans, such as principal, interest and penalties, if any, premiums on student loan insurance, fees, charges and other income derived
                    from services rendered or otherwise, proceeds of property or insurance, earnings and profits on investments of funds and from sales, purchases, endorsements or guarantees of obligations, as defined in G.S. 116-201 hereof, and other
                    securities and instruments, contract rights, any funds, rights, insurance or other benefits acquired pursuant to any federal law or contract to the extent not in conflict therewith, money recovered through the enforcement of any remedies
                    or rights, and any other funds or things of value which in the determination of the Authority may enhance the marketability of its revenue bonds. Money in the sinking fund shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions
                    as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds. Unless otherwise provided in the bond resolution, the revenue bonds at any time issued hereunder shall be entitled to payment from the sinking fund
                    without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this Article without obtaining, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, the consent of any department, division,
                    commission, board, body, bureau or agency of the State, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this Article
                    and the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Authority is authorized to provide by resolution or in any trust agreement for the issuance of revenue refunding bonds of the Authority for the purpose of refunding, or advance refunding and paying, any bonds then outstanding, which have been issued
                    under the provisions of this Article, including the payment of any redemption premium and of any interest accrued or to accrue up to the date of redemption of the bonds, and, if deemed advisable by the Authority, for making student
                    loans or acquiring obligations under this Article. The issuance of the revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and other details, the rights of the holders and the rights, duties and obligations of the Authority, shall be governed
                    by the appropriate provisions of this Article relating to the issuance of revenue bonds. Revenue refunding bonds issued under this section may be sold or exchanged for outstanding bonds issued under this Article. If sold, in addition
                    to any other authorized purpose, the proceeds may be deposited in an escrow or other trust fund and invested, in whole or in part, and with the earnings from the investments, may be applied to the purchase or to the redemption prior
                    to, or to payment at maturity, of outstanding bonds, all as provided by resolution or in trust agreement securing the bonds.

                    the duties of the Authority in relation to the purchase or sale of obligations, the making of student loans, the insurance of student loans, the fees, charges and premiums to be fixed and collected, the terms and conditions for the

                    individual right of action by bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of administering this Article and may be payable, together with other expenses

                    In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this Article may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having powers of a trust company
                    within or without the State. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the fees, penalties, charges, proceeds from collections, grants, subsidies, donations and other funds

                    may be required by the Authority. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the
                    foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust

                    may be necessary to provide such reserves for the bonds as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, shall be set aside in the sinking fund at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution

                    to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the
                    Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. The resolution by which a pledge is created need not be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of money to the credit of
                    the sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds. Any such resolution may, in the discretion of the Authority, provide for the transfer of surplus money in the sinking fund
                    to the credit of the Loan Fund. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.

                        It is expected that a student loan will inure to the private benefit of the person who obtains it. It is equally true that the education provided throughout the entire school system is intended to inure to the benefit of the individual who obtains it.
                        However, the fact that the individual obtains a private benefit cannot be considered sufficient ground to defeat the execution of the paramount public purpose of encouraging education. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville,

                    The Authority is authorized, in addition to all other powers and duties vested or imposed under this Article, to establish and administer a statewide student assistance program for the purpose of removing, insofar as may be possible, the financial barriers
                    to education beyond the high school level for eligible needy students at public or private institutions in this State and, with respect to loans, public, and private institutions located elsewhere. This objective shall be accomplished,
                    consistent with Federal law or regulation, through a comprehensive program under which the financial ability of each student and of his family, under standards prescribed by the Authority, is measured against the reasonable costs,
                    as determined by the Authority, of the educational program which the student proposes to pursue. Needs of students for financial assistance shall, to the extent of the availability of funds from federal, State, institutional or other
                    sources, be met through work-study programs, loans, grants and out-of-term employment, or a combination of these forms of assistance. With respect to grants made pursuant to this Article, no student is eligible to receive benefits
                    under this student assistance program for a total of more than 45 months of full-time, post-high school level education.

                    The Authority is authorized to make grants to eligible students enrolled or to be enrolled in eligible institutions in North Carolina out of such money as from time to time may be appropriated by the State or as may otherwise be available to the Authority
                    for such grants. The Authority, subject to the provisions of this Article and any applicable appropriation act, shall adopt rules, regulations and procedures for determining the needs of the respective students for grants and for the
                    purpose of making such grants. The amount of any grant made by the Authority to any student, whether enrolled or to be enrolled in any private institution or any tax-supported public institution, shall be determined by the Authority
                    upon the basis of substantially similar standards and guides that shall be set forth in the Authority’s rules, regulations and procedures; provided, however, that grants made in any fiscal year to students enrolled or to be enrolled
                    in private institutions may be increased to compensate, in whole or in part, for the average annual State appropriated tuition subsidy for such fiscal year, determined as provided herein. The average annual State appropriated subsidy
                    for each fiscal year shall be determined by the Secretary of Administration, after consultation with the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina and the Authority, for each of the two categories of tax-supported institutions,
                    being (i) institutions, presently 16, that provide education of the collegiate grade and grant baccalaureate degrees and (ii) institutions, such as community colleges and technical institutes created and existing under

The average annual State appropriated subsidy for each of such two categories of institutions shall mean the amount of the total appropriations of the State for the respective fiscal years under the current
                        operations budgets, pursuant to the State Budget Act reasonably allocable to undergraduate students enrolled in such institutions exclusive of the Division of Health Affairs of the University of North Carolina and the North Carolina
                        School of the Arts, redesignated effective August 1, 2008, as the “University of North Carolina School of the Arts” for all institutions in such category, all as shall be determined by the Secretary of Administration after consultation

                        Former law student’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 claims against a state university, alleging that the student’s expulsion from the university’s law school for academic misconduct violated the student’s Fourteenth Amendment rights and 20 U.S.C.S. § 1232, were dismissed,
                        as (1) the student failed to show that Congress had abrogated sovereign immunity in a manner applicable to the student’s claims; as sovereign immunity remained intact, (2) neither § 1983, § 1232, nor 28 U.S.C.S. § 1343 constituted
                        congressional abrogation of sovereign immunity pertinent to the student’s circumstances, and (3) as the Fourteenth Amendment did not itself destroy sovereign immunity, the court granted the university’s motion to dismiss pursuant
                        to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(1), based on the Eleventh Amendment, and the student’s § 1983 claim, unjust enrichment claim, and negligence claim were dismissed. Pfouts v. N.C. Cent. Univ., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4643 (M.D.N.C. Mar.

                    ($1,001,869) in nonrecurring funds shall be allocated to the State Education Assistance Authority (Authority) to be held in reserve to provide tuition grants for one academic year to each State resident who graduates from the North
                    Carolina School of Science and Mathematics at the end of the 2018-2019 school year and who enrolls as a full-time student in a constituent institution of The University of North Carolina for the 2019-2020 academic year. Except as otherwise
                    provided in this section, the amount of the grant awarded to each student shall cover the tuition cost at the constituent institution in which the student is enrolled.

                    from the appropriate constituent institution that the student applying for the grant is an eligible student. Upon receipt of the certification, the Authority shall remit at the times it prescribes the grant to the constituent institution
                    on behalf, and to the credit, of the student.

                    or other grant covering the cost of attendance at the constituent institution for which the tuition grant is awarded, then the amount of the tuition grant shall be reduced by an appropriate amount determined by the Authority. The Authority
                    shall reduce the amount of the tuition grant so that the sum of all grants and scholarship aid covering the cost of attendance received by the student, including the tuition grant under this section, shall not exceed the cost of attendance

                    Former G.S. 116-238.1 pertained to full tuition grant for graduates who attend a State university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2017-57, s. 10.26(a)-(d), provides: “(a) Of the funds appropriated by this act to the Board of Governors for the 2017-2018 fiscal year, the sum of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($ 1,500,000) shall be allocated to the State Education
                    Assistance Authority to be held in reserve to provide tuition grants for one academic year to each State resident who graduates from the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year and
                    who enrolls as a full-time student in a constituent institution of The University of North Carolina for the 2018-2019 academic year. The amount of the grant awarded to each student shall cover the tuition cost at the constituent institution
                    in which the student is enrolled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(b) The tuition grants provided for in this section shall be administered by the State Education Assistance Authority pursuant to rules adopted by the State Education Assistance Authority not inconsistent with this section. The State Education Assistance
                    Authority shall not approve any grant until it receives proper certification from the appropriate constituent institution that the student applying for the grant is an eligible student. Upon receipt of the certification, the State
                    Education Assistance Authority shall remit at the times it prescribes the grant to the constituent institution on behalf, and to the credit, of the student.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no tuition grant awarded to a student under this section shall exceed the cost of attendance at the constituent institution at which the student is enrolled. If a student, who is eligible for a
                    tuition grant under this subsection, also receives a scholarship or other grant covering the cost of attendance at the constituent institution for which the tuition grant is awarded, then the amount of the tuition grant shall be reduced
                    by an appropriate amount determined by the State Education Assistance Authority. The State Education Assistance Authority shall reduce the amount of the tuition grant so that the sum of all grants and scholarship aid covering the cost
                    of attendance received by the student, including the tuition grant under this section, shall not exceed the cost of attendance for the constituent institution at which the student is enrolled. The cost of attendance, as used in this
                    subsection, shall be determined by the State Education Assistance Authority for each constituent institution.

                    receiving innovative status as a result of receiving national certification, those systems shall be identical to the system certified and listed by the nationally recognized certification body and identical to the systems installed
                    in this State and approved by DHHS or other states or countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(4) Applications for wastewater systems and dispersal products received after the effective date of this subsection shall demonstrate structural integrity, including subjecting the trench system to axle load of 16,000 pounds when covered with 12 inches
                    of compacted soil and 4,000 pounds when covered with 6 inches of compacted soil without breakage, collapse, fracture, or compression that prevents the downline distribution of wastewater. Wastewater treatment devices with identifying
                    surface or above grade access for operation and maintenance shall be excluded from load testing when installed and backfilled in accordance with the rules or the product approval.

                <p>
                    “(5) Wastewater systems found by DHHS to meet standards for reclaimed water based on (i) field demonstrations over a two-year period in this State or other states approved by DHHS that the system meets reclaimed water standards or (ii) certification and
                    listing by a nationally recognized body, such as the National Sanitation Foundation Standard 350, shall be approved for designs that eliminate repair area rules in Type I soils. Elimination of repair areas shall be considered for domestic
                    strength wastewater only. Systems permitted without repair area under this subsection shall be classified by DHHS as a Type VI(b) system under DHHS rules and shall be inspected no less than 12 times per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(6) Vertical and horizontal restrictions to property lines and limiting conditions for systems approved under this subsection shall be reduced proportionally to the graduated increases in wastewater quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “(f) The Commission for Public Health and the Department of Health and Human Services shall report quarterly on their implementation of subsection (d) of this section beginning no later than May 1, 2022, and shall continue quarterly reporting until rulemaking
                    activities required by this section have been completed.

                    Session Laws 2017-196 provides in its preamble: “Whereas, the Constitution of North Carolina recognizes in Article I, Section 14, that “Freedom of speech and of the press are two of the great bulwarks of liberty and therefore shall never be restrained,
                    but every person shall be held responsible for their abuse”; and

                    “Whereas, in 1974, the Committee on Free Expression at Yale issued a statement known as the Woodward Report that stands as a classic defense of free expression on campuses; in 2015, the Committee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago issued
                    a similar and widely respected report; and, in 1967, the Kalven Committee Report of the University of Chicago articulated the principle of institutional neutrality regarding political and social issues and the essential role of such
                    neutrality in protecting freedom of thought and expression at universities. The principles affirmed by these three highly regarded reports are inspiring articulations of the critical importance of free expression in higher education;
