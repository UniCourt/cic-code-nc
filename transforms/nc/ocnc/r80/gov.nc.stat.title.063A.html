   <p>
    Session Laws 1991, c. 749, s. 2, provides: “Interpretation of act.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(a) This act shall not be deemed to exclude additional or alternative methods for executing the provisions of this act, shall be regarded as supplemental to power conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(b) This act, being necessary for the health and welfare of the people of this State, shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(c) Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of any general laws, the provisions of this act shall be controlling.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(d) Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of any local, special, or private laws, the provisions of those laws are repealed to the extent of the conflict.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(e) If any provisions of this act or its application are held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act that can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are severable.

   <p>
    “(f) References in this act to specific acts, sections, or Chapters of the General Statutes are intended to be references to such acts, sections, or chapters as they may be amended from time to time by the General Assembly.”

The chapter name has been set out as above at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.

    Bonds issued under the provisions of this Chapter may be secured by a security document which may be a trust instrument between the Authority and a bank or trust company or individual within the State, or a bank or a trust company outside the State, as trustee. The security document may pledge and assign the revenues provided for the security of the bonds, including proceeds from the sale of any project, or part thereof, insurance proceeds and condemnation awards, and may convey or mortgage the project and other property to secure a bond issue.

   <p>
    The revenues and other funds derived from the project, except for any part as may be necessary to provide reserves therefor, if any, may be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the security document in a sinking fund which may be pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as provided. The pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made. The revenues pledged and received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether the parties have notice. The use and disposition of money to the credit of the sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the security document. The security document may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:
