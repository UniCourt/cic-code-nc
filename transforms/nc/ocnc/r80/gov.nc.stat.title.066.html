      When any phonograph record or electrical transcription, upon which musical performances are embodied, is sold in commerce for use within this State, all asserted common-law rights to further restrict or to collect royalties on the commercial use made of such recorded performances by any person is hereby abrogated and expressly repealed.

     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny the rights granted any person by the United States copyright laws. The sole intendment of this enactment is to abolish any common-law rights attaching to phonograph records and electrical transcriptions, whose sole value is in their use, and to forbid further restrictions of the collection of subsequent fees and royalties on phonograph records and electrical transcriptions by performers who were paid for the initial performance at the recording thereof.

       “Use,”
   
   as employed in this section, means the use for which a recording is intended; i.e., the playing of the recording. Thus, under this section, any record sold in commerce for use in this State may be played privately, publicly, and commercially without restriction. It does not follow that the performance contained on the record can be rerecorded onto another record and the rerecording sold in competition with the original producer. Liberty/UA, Inc. v.

      Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that the employees shall assign or offer to assign any of his rights in an invention to his employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information except for those inventions that (i) relate to the employer’s business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to apply to the type of invention described, it is against the public policy of this State and in unenforceable.

       The TACIT Program, offered by North Carolina State University’s Department of Urban Affairs to units of local government to educate employees with respect to selecting appropriate computer equipment, does not violate the provisions of this section.

       Hearing aid fitting services provided in University of North Carolina (UNC) clinics by graduate students in the UNC Audiology Master Degree programs were an integral part of their professional education and training and, therefore, the constituent institutions of UNC did not violate the Umstead Act by operating clinics in which their graduate students provided hearing aid evaluation and fitting services to the public. See opinion of Attorney General to M. Jackson Nichols, Allen & Pinnex, P.A.,
   (1/8/02).

       The expenditure of public funds by North Carolina State University for all purposes, business-related and otherwise, is not unlimited, but is subject to the “public purpose” constitutional analysis; i.e., an expenditure must be reasonably related to the purposes for which the university was established, and must primarily benefit public, as opposed to private interests. See opinion of Attorney General to Representative Martin L. Nesbitt, North Carolina General Assembly, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 33 (11/26/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreements between the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television and private entities involving the production of commercial, noneducational products would both exceed its statutory authority and violate the Umstead Act; however, the Center is authorized to enter into agreements with private or public entities where such agreements will result in the creation of noncommercial, educational products. See opinion of Attorney General to Leslie J. Winner, University of North Carolina Vice President and General Counsel, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 34 (10/16/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       The endowment fund of the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television may enter into agreements with private or public entities for the use of the Center’s facilities to create commercial materials which may be unrelated to educational purposes, so long as the proceeds of such agreements are used for the benefit of the Center’s educational mission. See opinion of Attorney General to Leslie J. Winner, University of North Carolina Vice President and General Counsel, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 34 (10/16/02).

       Although businesses claimed university, through its trademark licensing program, violated this section by engaging indirectly in the sale of goods, the court declined to find that the statute created a private cause of action; subsection (e) denominating violation of section a misdemeanor provided an exclusive remedy and there was no clear indication that the section was intended to protect any special class of which businesses might have been members.

        The North Carolina State Fair exemption in subsection (b)
       </b>
       of this section applies to the buildings and grounds on a year-round basis. See opinion of Attorney General to Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., and the Council of State, 53 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 36 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 136-82, which authorizes the Department of Transportation to provide certain items at concessions on ferries and at ferry facilities, must be read in conjunction with the clearly expressed public policy stated in subsection (a) of this section that prohibits government agencies from competing with private industries in business. See opinion of Attorney General to E.H. McEntire, P.E., State Highway Chief Engineer, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 53 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The TACIT Program, offered by North Carolina State University’s Department of Urban Affairs to units of local government to educate employees with respect to selecting appropriate computer equipment, does not violate the provisions of this section. See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. George E. Tatum, Register of Deeds, Cumberland County, 55 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 101 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing aid fitting services provided in University of North Carolina (UNC) clinics by graduate students in the UNC Audiology Master Degree programs were an integral part of their professional education and training and, therefore, the constituent institutions of UNC did not violate the Umstead Act by operating clinics in which their graduate students provided hearing aid evaluation and fitting services to the public. See opinion of Attorney General to M. Jackson Nichols, Allen & Pinnex, P.A.,
   (1/8/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       The expenditure of public funds by North Carolina State University for all purposes, business-related and otherwise, is not unlimited, but is subject to the “public purpose” constitutional analysis; i.e., an expenditure must be reasonably related to the purposes for which the university was established, and must primarily benefit public, as opposed to private interests. See opinion of Attorney General to Representative Martin L. Nesbitt, North Carolina General Assembly, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 33 (11/26/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreements between the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television and private entities involving the production of commercial, noneducational products would both exceed its statutory authority and violate the Umstead Act; however, the Center is authorized to enter into agreements with private or public entities where such agreements will result in the creation of noncommercial, educational products. See opinion of Attorney General to Leslie J. Winner, University of North Carolina Vice President and General Counsel, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 34 (10/16/02).
      </p>
      <p>
       The endowment fund of the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television may enter into agreements with private or public entities for the use of the Center’s facilities to create commercial materials which may be unrelated to educational purposes, so long as the proceeds of such agreements are used for the benefit of the Center’s educational mission. See opinion of Attorney General to Leslie J. Winner, University of North Carolina Vice President and General Counsel, 2002 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 34 (10/16/02).

        Statute Is Highly Penal. —

      <p>
       <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.077.html" target="_blank">Chapter 77</a></cite>, Laws of 1913, codified as former G.S. 66-68 through 66-71, was of a highly penal character, and its meaning will not be extended by interpretation to include cases that did not come clearly within its provision. Jennette v. Coppersmith, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 82</cite>, 97 S.E. 54, 1918 N.C. LEXIS 186 (1918); Security Fin. Co. v. Hendry, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 549</cite>, 127 S.E. 629, 1925 N.C. LEXIS 353 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the courts will not lend their aid to extend a highly penal statute,
   
   although it is within the police power, unless the case comes within the letter of the law, and also within its meaning and palpable design. It is just as clearly the policy of the law that it will not lend its aid in enforcing a claim founded on its own violation. Security Fin. Co. v. Hendry, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 549</cite>, 127 S.E. 629, 1925 N.C. LEXIS 353 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent of the former statute is to prevent fraud or imposition
   
   upon those dealing with a business conducted under an assumed name, and to afford them means for knowing the status and responsibility of the concern with which they deal. Price v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 493</cite>, 101 S.E. 33, 1919 N.C. LEXIS 492 (1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       The former statute was enacted as a police regulation to protect the general public from fraud and imposition. Courtney v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 479</cite>, 92 S.E. 324, 1917 N.C. LEXIS 327 (1917); Security Fin. Co. v. Hendry, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 549</cite>, 127 S.E. 629, 1925 N.C. LEXIS 353 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       The former statute manifestly was for the protection of creditors of persons who fail to comply with its provisions, or of others who do business with them. The consequences of a violation were prescribed by former G.S. 66-71. They seem to be limited to punishment as a misdemeanor, for it was expressly provided that failure to comply with former G.S. 66-68, shall not prevent a recovery in a civil action by the person who shall violate the statute. Farmers' Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 479</cite>, 127 S.E. 527, 1925 N.C. LEXIS 339 (1925).

       Former G.S. 66-68 was intended to protect the public and creditors against fraud. Wilder v. Hobson, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 398 S.E.2d 625, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1209 (1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former section did not apply between partners
   
   who were presumed to know the status and responsibility of the partnership; and a surviving partner may maintain his action against the heirs of the dead one to recover his share in the assets of a partnership in a legitimate business, notwithstanding the business had been conducted in the name solely of the dead partner, and the requirements of the statute had not been complied with. Price v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 493</cite>, 101 S.E. 33, 1919 N.C. LEXIS 492 (1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a partnership in a legitimate business has been conducted in the name of one of the partners alone, as between themselves the former statute did not apply; and an action of the silent partner to recover his share of the assets from the other is not founded upon any wrong avoiding his recovery.

      <p>
       Former G.S. 39-24 (repealed) was enacted in 1939. The amendment to G.S. 1-69.1, which added the requirement of an allegation of recordation under former G.S. 66-68 before suit may be brought by an unincorporated association in its common name, was enacted effective October 1, 1975. In the face of any irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of these two statutes, G.S. 1-69.1, being the later enactment, will control or be regarded as a qualification of the earlier statute. Cherokee Home Demonstration Club v. Oxendine, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 397 S.E.2d 643, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1133 (1990).

      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of plaintiff unincorporated association to comply with the directives of G.S. 1-69.1 was fatal to its complaint. G.S. 1-69.1 requires an allegation of a recordation under former G.S. 66-68 before suit may be brought by an unincorporated association in its common name. Cherokee Home Demonstration Club v. Oxendine, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 397 S.E.2d 643, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1133 (1990).

        Requirement That Unincorporated Association Allege Its Registration. —

      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that G.S. 1-69.1 requires unincorporated association to allege its registration for purposes of bringing suit in its collective name, there is no concomitant requirement attached to its right to hold property under G.S. 39-25. Cherokee Home Demonstration Club v. Oxendine, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 397 S.E.2d 643, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1133 (1990).

      <p>
       Where a partnership was being conducted under the surname of the proprietors
   
   in such manner as to afford a reasonable and sufficient guide to a correct knowledge of the individuals composing the firm, the former statute did not apply. Befarah v. Spell, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 193</cite>, 96 S.E. 949, 1918 N.C. LEXIS 216 (1918).

      <p>
       In Jennette v. Coppersmith, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 82</cite>, 97 S.E. 54 (1918), it was held that the title of the plaintiffs’ firm, Jennette Bros., afforded a reasonable and sufficient guide to correct knowledge of the individuals composing the firm, and therefore did not come clearly within the doctrine of “assumed” names within the meaning of the former statute.

     <p>
      It is an unfair trade practice for any member of the diamond industry:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol11">
       To use, or cause or promote the use of, any trade promotional literature, advertising matter, guarantee, warranty, mark, brand, label, trade name, picture, design or device, designation, or other type of oral or written representation, however disseminated or published, which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers with respect to the type, kind, grade, quality, color, cut, quantity, size, weight, nature, substance, durability, serviceability, origin, preparation, production, manufacture, distribution, or customary or regular price, of any diamond or other product of the industry, or which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving the purchasing or consuming public in any other material respect.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol12">
       In the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of products of the industry to use the unqualified word “diamond” as descriptive of or as an identification for any object or product not meeting the requirement specified in the definition of diamond hereinabove set forth, or which, though meeting such requirements, has not been symmetrically fashioned with at least 17 polished facets.The foregoing provisions of subdivision (2) have application to the unqualified use of the word “diamond.” They are not to be construed as inhibiting:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t66a16s66-74ol12a">
         The use of the words “rough diamond” as descriptive of or as a designation for, uncut or unfaceted objects or products meeting the requirements specified in the mentioned definition of diamond; or
        </li>
        <li id="t66a16s66-74ol12b">
         The use of the word “diamond” as descriptive of or as a designation for objects or products meeting the requirements of said definition of diamond, but which have not been symmetrically fashioned with at least 17 polished facets when in immediate conjunction with the word “diamond,” there is either a disclosure of the number of facets and shape of the diamond or the name of a type of diamond which denotes shape and which usually has less than 17 facets (e.g., “rose diamond”); or
        </li>
        <li id="t66a16s66-74ol12c">
         The use of the words “imitation diamond” as descriptive of or as a designation for objects or products which do not meet the requirements of said definition of diamond but have an appearance similar to that of a cut and polished diamond.When the word “diamond” is so used, the qualifying word or words shall be of at least equal conspicuousness as the word “diamond.”
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol13">
       To use the words “reproduction,” “replica,” “diamond-like,” or similar terms as descriptive of imitation diamonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol14">
       To use the term “synthetic diamond” as descriptive of any object or product unless such object or product has in fact been artificially created and is of similar appearance and of essentially the same optical and physical properties and chemical structure as a diamond, or to apply the term “diamond” to any man-made objects or products unless it is immediately preceded in each instance with equal conspicuity by the word “synthetic.”
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol15">
       To use the word “perfect” or any other word, expression or representation of similar import, as descriptive of any diamond which discloses flaws, cracks, carbon spots, clouds, or other blemishes or imperfection of any sort when examined in normal daylight, or its equivalent, by a trained eye under a 10-power corrected diamond eye loupe or other equal magnifier.The use with respect to a stone which is not perfect of any phase (such as “commercially perfect”) containing the word “perfect” or “perfectly” is regarded as misleading and in violation of this subdivision, and this subdivision shall not be construed as approving of the use of the word “perfect,” or any word or representation of like import, as descriptive of any diamond that is of inferior color or make. Nothing is to be construed as inhibiting the use of the word “flawless” as descriptive of a diamond which meets the requirements for “perfect” set forth in this subdivision.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol16">
       In connection with the offering of any ring or rings or other articles of jewelry having a perfect center stone or stones, and side or supplementary stones which are not of such quality, to use the word “perfect” without clearly disclosing that such description applies only to the center stone or center stones.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol17">
       To use the term “blue white” or any other term, expression or representation of similar import as descriptive of any diamond which under normal, north daylight or its equivalent, shows any color or any trace of any color, other than blue or bluish.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol18">
       To advertise, offer for sale, or sell any diamond which has been artificially colored or tinted by coating, irradiating, or heating, or by use of nuclear bombardment, or by any other means, without disclosure of such fact to purchasers or prospective purchasers, or without disclosure that such artificial coloring or tinting is not permanent, if such is the fact.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol19">
       To use the terms “properly cut,” “proper cut,” “modern cut,” “well made,” or expressions of similar import, to describe any diamond that is lopsided or so thick or so thin in depth as materially to detract from the brilliance of the stone.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol110">
       To use the unqualified expressions “brilliant,” or “brilliant cut,” or “full cut” to describe, identify or refer to any diamond except a round diamond which has at least 32 facets, plus the table above the girdle and at least 24 facets below.Such terms should not be applied to single or rose-cut diamonds, either with or without qualification. They may be applied to emerald (rectangular) cut and marquise (pointed oval) cut diamonds meeting the above stated facet requirements when, in immediate conjunction with the term used, disclosure is made of the fact that the diamond is of emerald or marquise form.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol111">
       To use the terms “clean,” “eye clean,” “commercially clean,” “commercially white,” or any other terms, expressions, or representations of similar import in advertising, labeling, representing, or describing any diamond when such terms are used for the purpose, or with the capacity and tendency or effect, of misleading or deceiving purchasers, prospective purchasers, or the consuming public.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol112">
       To misrepresent the weight of any diamond or to deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the weight of any diamond.The standard unit for designation of the weight of a diamond is the carat, which is equivalent to 200 milligrams (one-fifth gram). While advertisements may state the approximate weight or range of weights of a group of products, all weight representations regarding individual products shall state the exact weight of the stone or stones and be accurate to within 1/200th of a carat (one-half “point”).
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol113">
       To state or otherwise represent the weight of all diamonds contained in a ring or other article of jewelry unless such weight figure is accompanied with equal conspicuity by the words “total weight” or words of similar import, so as to indicate clearly that the weight shown is that of all stones in the article and not that of the center or largest stone.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol114">
       To use the word “gem” to describe, identify or refer to any diamond which does not possess the requisite beauty, brilliance, value and other qualities necessary for classification as a gem.Not all diamonds are gems. For example: Small pieces of diamond rough or melee weighing only one or two points are not to be described as “gems.” Neither should stones which are grossly imperfect or of decidedly poor color be so classified unless they are of such a size as to be rare and desirable and valuable for that reason.No imitation diamond can be described as a gem under any circumstances.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol115">
       In connection with the offering for sale, sale, or distribution of diamonds or articles set with diamonds, to use as part of any advertisement, label, packaging material, or other sales promotion literature, any illustration, picture, diagram or other depiction which either alone or in conjunction with accompanying words or phrases has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers concerning the type, kind, grade, color, cut, quality, size, weight, or character of any diamond, or which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading the purchasing or consuming public in any other material respect.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol116">
       To use as part of any advertisement, label, packaging material, or other sales promotion literature, any illustration which exaggerates the size of a diamond inset or enlarges it out of proper proportion to the mounting, without clearly and conspicuously stating either the amount that the diamond has been enlarged in the illustration, or that the diamond in the illustration has been “enlarged to show detail.”
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol117">
       To represent, directly or indirectly, through the use of any statement or representation in advertising or through the use of any word or term in a corporate or trade name, or otherwise, that said member is a producer, cutter, or importer of diamonds, or owns or controls a cutting plant, or has connections abroad, through which importations of rough or cut stones are secured, or maintains offices abroad, when such is not the fact, or in any other manner to misrepresent the character, extent, volume, or type of business being conducted.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol118">
       To publish or circulate false or misleading price quotations, price lists, terms or conditions of sale or reports as to production or sales which have the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading purchasers, prospective purchasers, or the consuming public, or to advertise, sell or offer to sell diamonds or articles set with diamonds at prices purporting to be reduced from what are, in fact, fictitious or exaggerated manufacturer’s or distributor’s suggested retail selling price, or that contains what purport to be bona fide price quotations which are in fact higher than the prices at which such products are regularly and customarily sold in bona fide retail transactions. It is likewise an unfair trade practice to distribute, sell or offer for sale to the consuming public in such manner diamonds or articles set with diamonds bearing such false, fictitious, or exaggerated price tags or labels.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol119">
       To offer for sale, sell, advertise, describe, or otherwise represent diamonds or diamond-set merchandise as “close-outs,” “discontinued lines,” or “special bargains,” by use of such terms or by words or representations of similar import, when such is not true in fact; or to offer for sale, sell, advertise, describe or otherwise represent such articles where the capacity and tendency or effect thereof is to lead the purchasing or consuming public to believe the same are being offered for sale or sold at greatly reduced prices, or at so-called “bargain” prices when such is not the fact.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol120">
       To advertise a particular style or type of product for sale when purchasers or prospective purchasers responding to such advertisement cannot readily purchase the advertised style or type of product from the industry member and the purpose of the advertisement is to obtain prospects for the sale of a different style or type of product than that advertised.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol121">
       To use sale practices or methods which:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t66a16s66-74ol121a">
         Deprive prospective customers of a fair opportunity to purchase any advertised style or type of product; or
        </li>
        <li id="t66a16s66-74ol121b">
         To falsely disparage any advertised style or type of product or, without the knowledge of the customer, to substitute other styles or types of products which the advertiser intends to sell instead of the advertised style or type of product.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol122">
       To advertise or offer for sale a grossly inadequate supply of products at reduced or bargain prices without disclosure of the inadequacy of the supply available at such prices when such advertisement or offer has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a16s66-74ol123">
       To describe, identify or refer to a diamond as “certified,” or to use respecting it any other word or words of similar meaning or import unless:

     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this Article, “business opportunity” means the sale or lease of any products, equipment, supplies or services for the purpose of enabling the purchaser to start a business, and in which the seller represents:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t66a19s66-94ol11">
       That the seller will provide locations or assist the purchaser in finding locations for the use or operation of vending machines, racks, display cases or other similar devices, or currency-operated amusement machines or devices, on premises neither owned nor leased by the purchaser or seller; or
      </li>
      <li id="t66a19s66-94ol12">
       That it may, in the ordinary course of business, purchase any or all products made, produced, fabricated, grown, bred or modified by the purchaser using in whole or in part the supplies, services or chattels sold to the purchaser; or
      </li>
      <li id="t66a19s66-94ol13">
       The seller guarantees that the purchaser will derive income from the business opportunity which exceeds the price paid for the business opportunity; or that the seller will refund all or part of the price paid for the business opportunity, or repurchase any of the products, equipment, supplies or chattels supplied by the seller, if the purchaser is unsatisfied with the business opportunity and pays to the seller an initial, required consideration which exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00); or
      </li>
      <li id="t66a19s66-94ol14">
       That it will provide a sales program or marketing program which will enable the purchaser to derive income from the business opportunity which exceeds the price paid for the business opportunity, provided that this subsection shall not apply to the sale of a marketing program made in conjunction with the licensing of a federally registered trademark or a federally registered service mark, or when the purchaser pays less than two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Provided, that “business opportunity” does not include the sale of an on-going business when the owner of that business sells and intends to sell only that one business opportunity; nor does it include the not-for-profit sale of sales demonstration equipment, materials, or samples, for a total price of two hundred dollars ($200.00) or less.

      <p>
       <b>
        In order for the Business Opportunity Sales Act to apply
       </b>
       there must be a sale or lease of products, equipment, supplies, or services, for the purpose of enabling the purchaser to start a business; in addition, the seller must make one of the four types of representations listed in this section to the purchaser. Bunting v. Perdue, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 682, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18913 (E.D.N.C. 1985).

        Violation Predating Effective Date of Article. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff initially contracted with defendant in June, 1976, over one year before October 1, 1977, the effective date of the Business Opportunity Sales Act, and all further contracts between plaintiff and defendant enabled plaintiff to continue and/or expand his business as an independent contract grower, none of them being for the purpose of starting a business, any violation of the Business Opportunity Sales Act, assuming its applicability, occurred before the statute became operative. Bunting v. Perdue, Inc., 611 F. Supp. 682, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18913 (E.D.N.C. 1985).

        Precontract Dealings Regulated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is not confined to regulating the behavior of the seller at the time the contract of sale is signed, but seeks to regulate precontract dealings as well. Martin v. Pilot Indus., 632 F.2d 271, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 14328 (4th Cir. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        When seller guaranteed income from a franchise, it came within statute’s scope
       </b>
       and had to comply with the act in its dealings with purchaser. Seller could not then remove the sale of the franchise from the act’s requirements by later disclaiming any guarantee of profit. Martin v. Pilot Indus., 632 F.2d 271, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 14328 (4th Cir. 1980).

       Where the trial court found that no representations were made until after the sale was consummated and that the agreement was for sellers to be sales and purchase agents on a commission basis, based on these filings, the transaction did not come within the purview of the Business Opportunity Sales Act and plaintiffs were not required to comply with the provisions of the Act.

       Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of an investor where a business owner asserted that the investor was a loan broker, and the evidence showed that investor procured a loan to the owner’s business from a third party in return for consideration. Johnson v. Wornom, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 606 S.E.2d 372, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2 (2005).

       Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to plaintiff, which had agreed to lease equipment from defendant, in its action under the Loan Broker Act; a “loan” included an agreement to advance property, and defendant did not show that it had complied with G.S. 66-107 and G.S. 66-108 by providing a disclosure statement and maintaining a surety bond or trust account; and defendant failed to dispute that it had failed to refund plaintiff’s deposit. Printing Servs. of Greensboro, Inc. v. Am. Capital Group, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 637 S.E.2d 230, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C.

       Defendant is not precluded from being considered a “loan broker” simply because the party for whom the loan is intended is a corporation and not an individual; thus, when plaintiff, a corporation, had agreed to lease equipment from defendant, defendant was a “loan broker” under the Loan Broker Act.

       The language in subsection (a) obviously contemplates that a borrower has received some form of “benefit” or service for which a broker received compensation; therefore, it logically follows that the fact that a broker rendered the agreed upon services to a prospective borrower would not estop the borrower from seeking recovery under the provisions of this section.

      <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a">
       Prior to the sale of any prepaid entertainment contract for services which are available on the day of sale, the seller shall purchase a surety bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in this State, as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a1">
         The amount of the surety bond shall be equal to the aggregate value of outstanding liabilities to buyers, or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), whichever is greater. For purposes of this section, “liabilities” means the moneys actually received in advance from the buyer on or after January 1, 1993, for contract costs, less the prorated value of services rendered by the seller. The bond shall be in favor of the State of North Carolina and in a form approved by the Attorney General. The surety company shall have a duty to disclose the amount and status of the bond to the public upon request. Any person who is damaged by reason of the closing of a facility or bankruptcy of the seller, may bring an action against the bond to recover damages suffered; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety shall be only for actual damages and in no event shall exceed the amount of the bond.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a2">
         The amount of the bond shall be based upon a written sworn statement by the seller under penalty of perjury stating the seller’s outstanding liabilities to buyers. A corporate seller’s statement shall be signed by the president of the corporation; the statement of a partnership shall be signed by a general partner; and the statement of a sole proprietorship shall be signed by the sole proprietor. The statement and a copy of the bond shall be filed with the Attorney General within 90 days after the first contract is sold and at 180-day intervals thereafter.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a3">
         The amount of the bond shall be increased or may be decreased, as necessary, to take into account changes in the seller’s outstanding liabilities to buyers on a semiannual basis.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a4">
         The bonding requirement of this section applies to each location of the seller in any case where a seller operates or plans to operate more than one facility in the State. A separate bond for each separately located facility shall be filed with the Attorney General.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a5">
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no seller is required to purchase a bond in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per facility.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a6">
         A change in ownership shall not release, cancel, or terminate liability under any bond previously established unless the Attorney General agrees in writing to the release, cancellation, or termination because the new owner has established a new bond for the benefit of the previous owner’s members, or because the former owner has paid the required funds to its members.
        </li>
        <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a7">
         In lieu of purchasing the bond required by subdivision (1), an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in a form acceptable to the Attorney General, may be filed with the Attorney General.

           A buyer of prepaid entertainment contract services who suffers or sustains any loss or damage by reason of the closing of a facility or bankruptcy of the seller shall file a claim with the surety, and, if the claim is not paid, may bring an action based on the bond and recover against the surety. In the case of a letter of credit that has been filed with the Attorney General, the buyer may file a claim with the Attorney General;
          </li>
          <li id="t66a21s66-124ol1a8b">
           Any claim under paragraph a. of this subdivision shall be filed no later than one year from the date on which the facility closed or bankruptcy was filed;

         The seller shall establish a surety bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in the State or shall establish an escrow account with a licensed and insured bank or savings institution located in this State. The surety bond or escrow account shall be in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per location or in an amount equal to all contract costs received from the buyer, whichever is greater. The bond or escrow account shall be in favor of the State of North Carolina and a copy of the bond or escrow agreement shall be filed with the Attorney General prior to the sale of any prepaid entertainment contracts. The bond or escrow account shall remain in force until 60 days after all services of the seller are available to the buyer, at which time the seller shall comply with the bonding requirement of subsection (a) of this section. The escrow account shall be established and maintained only in a financial institution which agrees in writing with the Attorney General to hold all funds deposited and not to release such funds until receipt of written authorization from the Attorney General. The funds deposited will be eligible for withdrawal by the depositor after the facility has been open and providing services for 60 days and the Attorney General gives written authorization for withdrawal. Any person who is damaged by any violation of this Article, or by the seller’s breach of the contract for sale or any obligation arising therefrom may bring an action against the bond or escrow account to recover damages suffered; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety or escrow agent shall be for actual damages only and in no event shall exceed the amount of the bond or escrow account.

         The buyer’s right to cancel the contract pursuant to G.S. 66-121 shall be extended until midnight of the third business day after the date upon which the services become available and the buyer is notified that the services are available.

      For the purpose of this Article, a “discount buying club” is any person, firm or corporation, which in exchange for any valuable consideration offers to sell or to arrange the sale of goods or services to its customers at prices represented to be lower than are generally available. “Discount buying club” shall not include any cooperative buying association or other group in which no person is intended to profit or actually profits beyond the benefit that all members receive from buying at a discount; nor shall any person, firm or corporation be deemed “a discount buying club” solely by virtue of the fact that (i) for fifty dollars ($50.00) or less it sells tickets or coupons valid for use in obtaining goods or services from a retail merchant, or (ii) as a service collateral to its principal business, and for no additional charge it arranges for its members or customers to purchase or lease directly from particular merchants at a specified discount.

      For the purposes of this Article, a “rental referral agency” is a person or business which offers to assist any person in locating residential rental property in return for any consideration from a prospective tenant.

      <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1a">
       A rental referral agency shall not charge or attempt to collect any fees or other consideration from any prospective tenant except where rental housing is in fact obtained by such person through the assistance of that agency. For the purposes of this Article, such housing is obtained when the prospective tenant has contracted to rent the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1b">
       Deposits to be applied toward fees may be required by a rental referral agency pursuant to a written contract which includes provisions stating:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1b1">
         The specifications of housing sought by the prospective tenant, including maximum rent, desired lease period, geographic area, number of bedrooms required, number of children to be housed, and number and type of pets;

        <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1b2">
         That the deposit will be refunded within 10 days of the prospective tenant’s request should the specified housing not be obtained through the agency’s assistance within 30 days of the date of the contract;
        </li>
        <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1b3">

       Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a rental referral agency may charge or retain from any deposit a fee, not to exceed twenty dollars ($20.00), even if the prospective tenant fails to obtain rental housing through its assistance, provided that the following conditions are met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1c1">
         Any and all advertising for the rental referral agency discloses in a clear and conspicuous manner the agency’s name, the fact that it is a “rental referral agency” using that term, and the fact that it charges a fee; and
        </li>
        <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1c2">
         If a prospective tenant contacts the rental referral agency in response to an advertisement for a specific property listed by the agency and inquires about that property, the rental referral agency shall neither collect a fee nor obtain the prospective tenant’s signature on a contract without first verifying that the advertised property remains available and disclosing to the prospective tenant whether or not it is still available.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t66a23s66-143ol1d">
       Prospective tenants shall apply in writing for a refund no sooner than 30 days after the date of the contract and no later than one year after the date of the contract.  If the prospective tenant does not apply for a refund before one year has elapsed, the fee shall be deemed earned by the rental referral agency and may be removed from the trust account.

      <p>
       When an employer sued the employer’s former employees for misappropriating the employer’s trade secrets, the employer did not fail to maintain the secrecy of the trade secrets by giving them to an employee who was about to leave the employer because (1) the employee was still bound by the employee’s confidentiality agreement, and (2) the employer could not practically employ the employee without giving the employee the secrets.

        Establishing a Trade Secret. —

      <p>
       Subdivision (3) of this section, defines a trade secret as valuable business or technical information that a) is neither “generally known nor readily ascertainable through independent development or reverse engineering,” and b) has been subject to “efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.” In order to resist a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that his concept satisfies these two requirements.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff adequately defined its trade secrets for the purposes of summary judgment by identifying its customer list, vendor lists, and technical information as trade secrets accessed by defendant competitor; plaintiff produced the actual customer list and vendor information that it claimed were trade secrets and a list of employees who could explain in detail which technical information was classified as a trade secret. Static Control Components, Inc. v. Darkprint Imaging, Inc., 200 F. Supp. 2d 541, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13271 (M.D.N.C. 2002).

        Factors in Determining Whether Information Is Trade Secret. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper factors to consider when determining whether information is a trade secret are: (1) the extent to which it is known outside the business; (2) the extent to which it is known to employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken to guard its secrecy; (4) its value to the business and competitors; (5) the amount of money or effort expended in its development; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which it could properly be acquired or duplicated by others. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 514 S.E.2d 276, <cite class="nc_code">1999 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 262 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trade secret need not be comprised of positive information, such as specific formula, but can include negative, inconclusive, or sufficiently suggestive research data that would give a person skilled in the art a competitive advantage one might not otherwise enjoy but for the knowledge gleaned from the owner’s research investment. Glaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd., 931 F. Supp. 1280, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9592 (E.D.N.C. 1996), aff'd, 110 F.3d 1562, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 6472 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
      </p>

       There were genuine issues of fact as to whether defendants were using the same overall manufacturing process to produce their splinting products in a manner that constituted appropriation of plaintiff’s trade secrets in manufacturing their products. Therefore, the court would deny defendants’ summary judgment motion as to this part of plaintiff’s trade secrets appropriation claim. BSN Med., Inc. v. Parker Med. Assocs. LLC, 2011 U.S. Dist.

       Trial court did not err by determining that the appropriate choice of law test for use in misappropriation of trade secrets cases was the lex loci test; the weight of case law tended to support the application of the lex loci test, rather than the most significant relationship test, in the misappropriation of trade secrets context.

       Defendant former employees had the right to utilize information contained in plaintiff’s customer lists, as a list of customer names and addresses is not a “trade secret” under this section. UBS PaineWebber, Inc. v. Aiken, 197 F. Supp. 2d 436, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4510 (W.D.N.C. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper to dismiss employers’ misappropriation of trade secrets claim because the amended complaint, on its face, did not show that the employers’ customer lists constituted a protected trade secret; the employers failed to allege that the lists contained any information that would not be readily accessible to a competitor or dance instructors.

       The plaintiff, a lawn and landscaping corporation, presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that its historical cost information was a trade secret as defined by this section and that the defendant, an ex-employee, misappropriated the information in order to underbid and compete with the plaintiff.

      </p>
      <p>
       Targeted solicitation, and the use of those targeted employees to solicit other employees with that information, was an unfair trade practice under G.S. 75-1.1; since the corporation also showed that the customers it lost and the geographical areas where it lost business were the same customers and areas of the employees who the LLC hired away from the corporation, the corporation showed a proximate cause connection to its lost profits and those lost profit damages, along with treble damages and attorney fees, were properly awarded. Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head &amp; Engquist Equip., L.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 620 S.E.2d 222, <cite class="nc_code">2005 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2290 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer sufficiently proved a former employee’s misappropriation of the employer’s trade secrets because (1) the employer established a prima facie case of misappropriation, and (2) the employees did not show the employees acquired the trade secrets through independent development, reverse engineering, or from someone who had the right to disclose the secrets, so the employees did not rebut the employer’s prima facie case. Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 752 S.E.2d 634, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1294 (2013).

Therefore, misappropriation of the former employer’s trade secrets by the competitor was unlikely, and a claim of misappropriation on the evidence presented to the trial court had to fail.

       What type and how many animals are going to be used in a particular research project is not a trade secret, nor is whether surgery is going to be performed or the type of anesthesia to be used. Pre and post operative procedures are not trade secrets, nor is how the animal’s pain and discomfort are to be minimized nor the method of euthanasia, if any. S.E.T.A. Unc-Ch, Inc. v.

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to issue a preliminary injunction in favor of a former employer after two of its former employees began working for a competitor, as misappropriation of its trade secrets by the competitor was unlikely because the evidence at trial indicated that the products made by the former employer and the competitor were too divergent to allow interchangeable use of the former employer’s trade secrets. Therefore, misappropriation of the former employer’s trade secrets by the competitor was unlikely, and a claim of misappropriation on the evidence presented to the trial court had to fail.

       Former employer carried its burden of identifying specific trade secrets at risk when a former employee left the employer to work for a competitor because the employer and the competitor shared customers and the employer identified the production factors for which it claimed trade secret protection, while the employee acknowledged performing research and development for these factors during the employee’s time at the employer and was responsible for keeping proprietary information regarding processes.

       Trial court did not err in dismissing a bank’s misappropriation of trade secrets counterclaims against employees because the bank did not identify with sufficient specificity either the trade secrets the employees allegedly misappropriated or the acts by which the alleged misappropriations were accomplished; the identification of the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated was broad and vague.

      <p>
       Employers failed to allege the existence of a trade secret because their complaint was devoid of any allegation of a method, plan, or other act by which they attempted to maintain the secrecy of the alleged trade secrets; that the employers shared information with dance instructors with nothing more than an expectation of confidentiality was insufficient to establish that the information was the subject of efforts that were reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

      <p>
       It was proper to dismiss employers’ misappropriation of trade secrets claim because they failed to describe a specific idea, concept, strategy, or tactic with respect to their marketing plan or to provide any detail about their dance productions; thus, their claim was too general to determine whether there was a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process at issue.

       Damages awarded to defendant on its breach of contract counterclaim did not overlap with either the damages awarded under 17 U.S.C.S. § 504(b) for copyright infringement or the damages awarded under G.S. 66-154(b) for trade secret misappropriation because the jury awarded only unpaid licensing fees with respect to defendant’s breach of contract counterclaim and the jury awarded only plaintiff’s ill-gotten profits with respect to defendant’s copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation counterclaims.

       Employer failed to show damages caused by a former employee’s alleged misappropriation of trade secrets which would cause the employer to lose a bid for a follow-on government contract, since whether the employer would otherwise be awarded the contract was speculative and dependent upon intervening factors such as other bidders and an objective third-party government agency evaluating bids.

       Finding that a suit was brought with malicious intent did not exclude the possibility that it was brought in good faith, which excluded an award of attorney’s fees under G.S. 66-154(d).

      <p>
       Pursuant to G.S. 66-154(d), defendant that prevailed on its counterclaim for trade secret misappropriation was awarded reasonable attorney’s fees because plaintiff willfully misappropriated 333 of defendant’s trade secrets over the course of several years and plaintiff’s actions demonstrated a reckless and wanton disregard of defendant’s rights.

       In a specialized construction equipment rental market where customer pricing was highly competitive, a corporation’s pricing, customer, and employee salary information met the factors of a trade secret under G.S. 66-152, and those trade secrets were misappropriated when a competing limited liability company solicited the corporation’s employees who had that information.

       There was evidence to support a determination that a staffing agency and its new manager had misappropriated trade secrets of an agency competitor, for whom the manager had previously worked, where the competitor provided evidence that the agency had access to its trade secrets through the manager and that it had the opportunity to use them for purposes of G.S. 66-155; there was evidence that the manager had accessed confidential information of the competitor with unusual frequency just shortly prior to meeting with the agency to work out a new employment relationship with them.

       In a pharmaceutical company’s suit against a developer alleging misappropriation of trade secrets under the North Carolina Trade Secret Protection Act, G.S. 66-152 et seq., the developer’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action was denied because the company sufficiently pled that based on the alleged relationship between the parties, whereby the company asserted ownership over all know-how and intellectual property associated with the development of the products by the developer exclusively for the company and the identification of the claimed trade secrets, the company sufficiently alleged facts to support its claim of misappropriation.

       Employers failed to allege the existence of a trade secret because their complaint was devoid of any allegation of a method, plan, or other act by which they attempted to maintain the secrecy of the alleged trade secrets; that the employers shared information with dance instructors with nothing more than an expectation of confidentiality was insufficient to establish that the information was the subject of efforts that were reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.

       It was proper to dismiss employers’ misappropriation of trade secrets claim because they failed to describe a specific idea, concept, strategy, or tactic with respect to their marketing plan or to provide any detail about their dance productions; thus, their claim was too general to determine whether there was a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process at issue.

      <p>
       Allegations in the state’s complaint against a tobacco manufacturing corporation’s failure to make payments to an escrow fund in violation of G.S. 66-192 were sufficient to state a claim for piercing the corporate veil; the complaint alleged that the principal of the corporation overwhelmingly dominated and controlled the corporation to the extent that it had no separate identity, and used that control to set the corporation’s pricing structure so as to violate G.S. 66-291(b); thus, the principal’s control and statutory violation proximately caused unjust capital loss to the escrow fund.

       The General Assembly recognizes that many of its citizens rely heavily on favorable credit ratings in order to obtain goods and services, and that some of these citizens are unable to secure credit because of unfavorable credit histories.  The General Assembly further recognizes that consumers sometimes need assistance in obtaining credit or in correcting erroneous credit histories, and that this need has given rise to the establishment of businesses organized for the purpose of providing credit repair services.  The purpose of this Article is to ensure that businesses offering credit repair services are providing these services in a manner that is fair and reasonable to the consuming public.

        Instrumentality Rule. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purpose of a G.S. 66-291(c) claim, a shareholder was not a new party in the State’s action to enforce the terms of a master settlement agreement in tobacco litigation because the shareholder was not legally a distinct entity from the corporation. Applying the instrumentality rule, the corporation was so operated that it was a mere instrumentality or alter ego of the shareholder and a shield for the shareholder’s activities that violated G.S. 66-291(c). State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 431</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 107, 2008 N.C. LEXIS 687 (2008).

       <b>
        Civil Conspiracy Cause of Action. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       State sufficiently alleged a cause of action for civil conspiracy to violate G.S. 66-291 because the complaint alleged that an agreement existed between individuals to violate, pursuant to a common scheme, a tobacco manufacturing corporation’s escrow obligation under G.S. 66-291, which caused injury to the State by depriving the State of a fund against which it could execute judgments; furthermore, the allegations were sufficient to support the theory that one of the individuals, who was the principal of the tobacco manufacturing corporation, had an independent personal stake in achieving the corporation’s illegal objective. State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 613, 646 S.E.2d 790, <cite class="nc_code">2007 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1613 (2007), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 431</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 107, 2008 N.C. LEXIS 687 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       State’s civil conspiracy complaint should not have been dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The complaint specifically alleged that there was an agreement of an incorporator and owners and managers of a seller to unfairly and deceptively underprice the cigarettes made by the corporation and distributed and sold by an exclusive seller so that the corporation would be unable to deposit sufficient escrow to cover sales in violation of G.S. 66-291 and would deprive the State of North Carolina of a fund against which it could execute judgments against the corporation. State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 431</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 107, 2008 N.C. LEXIS 687 (2008).

        Personal Jurisdiction Over Foreign Corporation Not Shown. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action filed by the State against a foreign corporation under G.S. 66-291, the trial court properly dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction, because: (1) the State’s conclusory allegation was insufficient to establish an alter ego theory of liability for personal jurisdiction purposes; (2) there was no evidence of any act or omission by the foreign corporation within North Carolina in the record; and (3) the trial court specifically found that the foreign corporation was not in the State of North Carolina when it received the alleged fraudulent funds from the North Carolina corporation.

The bond may be drawn upon by the Attorney General to cover unsatisfied escrow obligations, penalties, and any other liability under the tobacco laws of the State.Some factors, though not exclusive, which the Attorney General may consider in determining whether any nonparticipating manufacturer or importer poses an elevated risk of noncompliance are (i) the nonparticipating manufacturer or any affiliate thereof or importer has illegally failed to satisfy an escrow obligation with respect to any state in the past; (ii) any state has removed the nonparticipating manufacturer or its brand families or an affiliate or any of the affiliate’s brand families from the state’s tobacco directory for noncompliance with the state’s laws; (iii) any state has pending litigation against, or an unsatisfied judgment against the nonparticipating manufacturer or any affiliate thereof or importer for escrow or penalties related to noncompliance with state escrow laws; (iv) the nonparticipating manufacturer sells its cigarettes or tobacco products directly to consumers via remote or other non-face-to-face means; (v) a state or federal court has determined that the nonparticipating manufacturer or importer has violated any tobacco tax or tobacco control law or engaged in unfair business practice or unfair competition; or (vi) the nonparticipating manufacturer or importer fails to submit or complete any required forms, documents, certifications, or notices, in a timely manner or, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.

       “Agreement.”  Whether the parties have reached an agreement is determined by their express language and all surrounding circumstances. The Restatement 2d Contracts § 3 provides that, “An agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons.” See also Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 2, Comment b. The Uniform Commercial Code specifically includes in the circumstances from which an agreement may be inferred “course of performance, course of dealing and usage of trade . . .” as defined in the UCC. Although the definition of agreement in this Act does not make specific reference to usage of trade and other party conduct, this definition is not intended to affect the construction of the parties’ agreement under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction. Where that law takes account of usage and conduct in informing the terms of the parties’ agreement, the usage or conduct would be relevant as “other circumstances” included in the definition under this Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol22">
       “Automated Transaction.”  An automated transaction is a transaction performed or conducted by electronic means in which machines are used without human intervention to form contracts and perform obligations under existing contracts. Such broad coverage is necessary because of the diversity of transactions to which this Act may apply.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol23">
       “Computer program.”  This definition refers to the functional and operating aspects of an electronic, digital system. It relates to operating instructions used in an electronic system such as an electronic agent. (See definition of “Electronic Agent”).
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol24">
       “Electronic.”  The basic nature of most current technologies and the need for a recognized, single term warrants the use of “electronic” as the defined term. The definition is intended to assure that the Act will be applied broadly as new technologies develop. The term must be construed broadly in light of developing technologies in order to fulfill the purpose of this Act to validate commercial transactions regardless of the medium used by the parties. Current legal requirements for “writings” can be satisfied by most any tangible media, whether paper, other fibers, or even stone. The purpose and applicability of this Act covers intangible media which are technologically capable of storing, transmitting and reproducing information in human perceivable form, but which lack the tangible aspect of paper, papyrus or stone.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol25">
       “Electronic agent.”  This definition establishes that an electronic agent is a machine. As the term “electronic agent” has come to be recognized, it is limited to a tool function. The effect on the party using the agent is addressed in the operative provisions of the Act (e.g., Section 14 [G.S. 66-324]).
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol26">
       “Electronic record.”  An electronic record is a subset of the broader defined term “record.” It is any record created, used or stored in a medium other than paper (see definition of electronic). The defined term is also used in this Act as a limiting definition in those provisions in which it is used.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol27">
       “Electronic signature.”  The idea of a signature is broad and not specifically defined. Whether any particular record is “signed” is a question of fact. Proof of that fact must be made under other applicable law. This act simply assures that the signature may be accomplished through an electronic means. No specific technology need be used in order to create a valid signature. One’s voice on an answering machine may suffice if the requisite intention is present. Similarly, including one’s name as part of an electronic mail communication also may suffice, as may the firm name on a facsimile. It also may be shown that the requisite intent was not present and accordingly the symbol, sound or process did not amount to a signature. One may use a digital signature with the requisite intention, or one may use the private key solely as an access device with no intention to sign, or otherwise accomplish a legally binding act. In any case the critical element is the intention to execute or adopt the sound or symbol or process for the purpose of signing the related record.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol28">
       “Governmental agency.”  This definition is important in the context of optional Sections 17-19.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol29">
       “Information processing system.”  This definition is consistent with the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce. The term includes computers and other information systems. It is principally used in Section 15 [G.S. 66-325] in connection with the sending and receiving of information. In that context, the key aspect is that the information enter a system from which a person can access it.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol210">
       “Record.”  This is a standard definition designed to embrace all means of communicating or storing information except human memory. It includes any method for storing or communicating information, including “writings.” A record need not be indestructible or permanent, but the term does not include oral or other communications which are not stored or preserved by some means. Information that has not been retained other than through human memory does not qualify as a record. As in the case of the terms “writing” or “written,” the term “record” does not establish the purposes, permitted uses or legal effect which a record may have under any particular provision of substantive law. ABA Report on Use of the Term “Record,” October 1, 1996.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol211">
       “Security procedure.”  A security procedure may be applied to verify an electronic signature, verify the identity of the sender, or assure the informational integrity of an electronic record. The definition does not identify any particular technology. This permits the use of procedures which the parties select or which are established by law. It permits the greatest flexibility among the parties and allows for future technological development.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-312ol212">
       “Transaction.”  The definition has been limited to actions between people taken in the context of business, commercial or governmental activities. The term includes all interactions between people for business, commercial, including specifically consumer, or governmental purposes. However, the term does not include unilateral or non-transactional actions. As such it provides a structural limitation on the Scope of the Act as stated in the next section.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Where the law applicable to a given transaction provides that system rules and the like constitute part of the agreement of the parties, such rules will have the same effect in determining the parties agreement under this Act. For example, UCC Article 4 (Section 4-103(b)) provides that Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars and clearinghouse rules have the effect of agreements. Such agreements by law properly would be included in the definition of agreement in this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The parties’ agreement is relevant in determining whether the provisions of this Act have been varied by agreement. In addition, the parties’ agreement may establish the parameters of the parties’ use of electronic records and signatures, security procedures and similar aspects of the transaction. See Model Trading Partner Agreement, 45 Business Lawyer Supp. Issue (June 1990). See Section 5(b) [G.S. 66-315(b)] and comments thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      As with electronic agents, this definition addresses the circumstance where electronic records may result in action or performance by a party although no human review of the electronic records is anticipated. Section 14 [G.S. 66-324] provides specific rules to assure that where one or both parties do not review the electronic records, the resulting agreement will be effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      The critical element in this definition is the lack of a human actor on one or both sides of a transaction. For example, if one orders books from Bookseller.com through Bookseller’s website, the transaction would be an automated transaction because Bookseller took and confirmed the order via its machine. Similarly, if Automaker and supplier do business through Electronic Data Interchange, Automaker’s computer, upon receiving information within certain pre-programmed parameters, will send an electronic order to supplier’s computer. If Supplier’s computer confirms the order and processes the shipment because the order falls within pre-programmed parameters in Supplier’s computer, this would be a fully automated transaction. If, instead, the Supplier relies on a human employee to review, accept, and process the Buyer’s order, then only the Automaker’s side of the transaction would be automated. In either case, the entire transaction falls within this definition.
     </p>
     <p>
      While not all technologies listed are technically “electronic” in nature (e.g., optical fiber technology), the term “electronic” is the most descriptive term available to describe the majority of current technologies. For example, the development of biological and chemical processes for communication and storage of data, while not specifically mentioned in the definition, are included within the technical definition because such processes operate on electromagnetic impulses. However, whether a particular technology may be characterized as technically “electronic,” i.e., operates on electromagnetic impulses, should not be determinative of whether records and signatures created, used and stored by means of a particular technology are covered by this Act. This act is intended to apply to all records and signatures created, used and stored by any medium which permits the information to be retrieved in perceivable form.
     </p>
     <p>
      An electronic agent, such as a computer program or other automated means employed by a person, is a tool of that person. As a general rule, the employer of a tool is responsible for the results obtained by the use of that tool since the tool has no independent volition of its own. However, an electronic agent, by definition, is capable within the parameters of its programming, of initiating, responding or interacting with other parties or their electronic agents once it has been activated by a party, without further attention of that party.
     </p>
     <p>
      While this Act proceeds on the paradigm that an electronic agent is capable of performing only within the technical strictures of its preset programming, it is conceivable that, within the useful life of this Act, electronic agents may be created with the ability to act autonomously, and not just automatically. That is, through developments in artificial intelligence, a computer may be able to “learn through experience, modify the instructions in their own programs, and even devise new instructions.” Allen and Widdison, “Can Computers Make Contracts?”
      <i>
       9 Harv. J.L.&Tech 25
      </i>
      (Winter, 1996). If such developments occur, courts may construe the definition of electronic agent accordingly, in order to recognize such new capabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The examples involving Bookseller.com and Automaker in the comment to the definition of Automated Transaction are equally applicable here. Bookseller acts through an electronic agent in processing an order for books. Automaker and the supplier each act through electronic agents in facilitating and effectuating the just-in-time inventory process through EDI.
     </p>
     <p>
      Information processing systems, computer equipment and programs, electronic data interchange, electronic mail, voice mail, facsimile, telex, telecopying, scanning, and similar technologies all qualify as electronic under this act. Accordingly information stored on a computer hard drive or floppy disc, facsimiles, voice mail messages, messages on a telephone answering machine, audio and video tape recordings, among other records, all would be electronic records under this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition requires that the signer execute or adopt the sound, symbol, or process with the intent to sign the record. The act of applying a sound, symbol or process to an electronic record could have differing meanings and effects. The consequence of the act and the effect of the act as a signature are determined under other applicable law. However, the essential attribute of a signature involves applying a sound, symbol or process with an intent to do a legally significant act. It is that intention that is understood in the law as a part of the word “sign”, without the need for a definition.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Act establishes, to the greatest extent possible, the equivalency of electronic signatures and manual signatures. Therefore the term “signature” has been used to connote and convey that equivalency. The purpose is to overcome unwarranted biases against electronic methods of signing and authenticating records. The term “authentication,” used in other laws, often has a narrower meaning and purpose than an electronic signature as used in this Act. However, an authentication under any of those other laws constitutes an electronic signature under this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The precise effect of an electronic signature will be determined based on the surrounding circumstances under section 9(b) [G.S. 66-319(b)].
     </p>
     <p>
      This definition includes as an electronic signature the standard webpage click through process. For example, when a person orders goods or services through a vendor’s website, the person will be required to provide information as part of a process which will result in receipt of the goods or services. When the customer ultimately gets to the last step and clicks “I agree,” the person has adopted the process and has done so with the intent to associate the person with the record of that process. The actual effect of the electronic signature will be determined from all the surrounding circumstances, however, the person adopted a process which the circumstances indicate s/he intended to have the effect of getting the goods/services and being bound to pay for them. The adoption of the process carried the intent to do a legally significant act, the hallmark of a signature.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another important aspect of this definition lies in the necessity that the electronic signature be linked or logically associated with the record. In the paper world, it is assumed that the symbol adopted by a party is attached to or located somewhere in the same paper that is intended to be authenticated, e.g., an allonge firmly attached to a promissory note, or the classic signature at the end of a long contract. These tangible manifestations do not exist in the electronic environment, and accordingly, this definition expressly provides that the symbol must in some way be linked to, or connected with, the electronic record being signed. This linkage is consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. 21 CFR Part 11 (March 20, 1997).
     </p>
     <p>
      A digital signature using public key encryption technology would qualify as an electronic signature, as would the mere inclusion of one’s name as a part of an e-mail message — so long as in each case the signer executed or adopted the symbol with the intent to sign.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definition in this Act is broad and is used to illustrate one way of establishing attribution or content integrity of an electronic record or signature. The use of a security procedure is not accorded operative legal effect, through the use of presumptions or otherwise, by this Act. In this Act, the use of security procedures is simply one method for proving the source or content of an electronic record or signature.
     </p>
     <p>
      A security procedure may be technologically very sophisticated, such as an asymetric cryptographic system. At the other extreme the security procedure may be as simple as a telephone call to confirm the identity of the sender through another channel of communication. It may include the use of a mother’s maiden name or a personal identification number (PIN). Each of these examples is a method for confirming the identity of a person or accuracy of a message.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is essential that the term commerce and business be understood and construed broadly to include commercial and business transactions involving individuals who may qualify as “consumers” under other applicable law. If Alice and Bob agree to the sale of Alice’s car to Bob for $2000 using an internet auction site, that transaction is fully covered by this Act. Even if Alice and Bob each qualify as typical “consumers,” under other applicable law, their interaction is a transaction in commerce. Accordingly their actions would be related to commercial affairs, and fully qualify as a transaction governed by this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other transaction types include:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. A single purchase by an individual from a retail merchant, which may be accomplished by an order from a printed catalog sent by facsimile, or by exchange of electronic mail.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Recurring orders on a weekly or monthly basis between large companies which have entered into a master trading partner agreement to govern the methods and manner of their transaction parameters.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. A purchase by an individual from an online internet retail vendor. Such an arrangement may develop into an ongoing series of individual purchases, with security procedures and the like, as a part of doing ongoing business.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. The closing of a business purchase transaction via facsimile transmission of documents or even electronic mail. In such a transaction, all parties may participate through electronic conferencing technologies. At the appointed time all electronic records are executed electronically and transmitted to the other party. In such a case, the electronic records and electronic signatures are validated under this Act, obviating the need for “in person” closings.
     </p>
     <p>
      A transaction must include interaction between two or more persons. Consequently, to the extent that the execution of a will, trust, or a health care power of attorney or similar health care designation does not involve another person and is a unilateral act, it would not be covered by this Act because not occurring as a part of a transaction as defined in this Act. However, this Act
      <i>
       does
      </i>
      apply to all electronic records and signatures
      <i>
       related

       The Scope of this Act is inherently limited by the fact that it only applies to transactions related to business, commercial (including consumer) and governmental matters. Consequently, transactions with no relation to business, commercial or governmental transactions would not be subject to this Act. Unilaterally generated electronic records and signatures which are not part of a transaction also are not covered by this Act. See Section 2 [G.S. 66-312], Comment 12.

       This act affects the medium in which information, records and signatures may be presented and retained under current legal requirements. While this Act covers all electronic records and signatures which are used in a business, commercial (including consumer) or governmental transaction, the operative provisions of the act relate to requirements for writings and signatures under other laws. Accordingly, the exclusions in subsection (b) focus on those legal rules imposing certain writing and signature requirements which will not  be affected by this act.

       Paragraph (1) excludes wills, codicils and testamentary trusts. This exclusion is largely salutary given the unilateral context in which such records are generally created and the unlikely use of such records in a transaction as defined in this Act (i.e., actions taken by two or more persons in the context of business, commercial or governmental affairs). Paragraph (2) excludes all of the Uniform Commercial Code other than UCC Sections 1-107 and 1-206, and Articles 2 and 2A. This Act does not apply to the excluded UCC articles, whether in “current” or “revised” form. The Act does apply to UCC Articles 2 and 2A and to UCC Sections 1-107 and 1-206.

      <li id="t66a40s66-313ol25">
       Articles 3, 4 and 4A of the UCC impact payment systems and have specifically been removed from the coverage of this Act. The check collection and electronic fund transfer systems governed by Articles 3, 4 and 4A involve systems and relationships involving numerous parties beyond the parties to the underlying contract. The impact of validating electronic media in such systems involves considerations beyond the scope of this Act. Articles 5, 8 and 9 have been excluded because the revision process relating to those Articles included significant consideration of electronic practices. Paragraph 4 provides for exclusion from this Act of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) because the drafting process of that Act also included significant consideration of electronic contracting provisions.

      <li id="t66a40s66-313ol26">
       The very limited application of this Act to Transferable Records in Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] does not affect payment systems, and the Section is designed to apply to a transaction through express agreement of the parties. The exclusion of Articles 3 and 4 will not affect the Act’s coverage of Transferable Records. Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] is designed to allow for the development of systems which will provide “control” as defined in Section 16 [G.S. 66-326]. Such control is necessary as a substitute for the idea of possession which undergirds negotiable instrument law. The technology has yet to be developed which will allow for the possession of a unique electronic token embodying the rights associated with a negotiable promissory note. Section 16’s [G.S. 66-326’s] concept of control is intended as a substitute for possession.

      <li id="t66a40s66-313ol27">
       This Act does apply, in toto, to transactions under unrevised Articles 2 and 2A. There is every reason to validate electronic contracting in these situations. Sale and lease transactions do not implicate broad systems beyond the parties to the underlying transaction, such as are present in check collection and electronic funds transfers. Further sales and leases generally do not have a far reaching effect on the rights of parties beyond the contracting parties, such as exists in the secured transactions system. Finally, it is in the area of sales, licenses and leases that electronic commerce is occurring to its greatest extent today. To exclude these transactions would largely gut the purpose of this Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-313ol28">
       An electronic record/signature may be used for purposes of more than one legal requirement, or may be covered by more than one law. Consequently, it is important to make clear, despite any apparent redundancy, in subsection (c) that an electronic record used for purposes of a law which is not affected by this act under subsection (b) may nonetheless be used and validated for purposes of other laws not excluded by subsection (b). For example, this Act does not apply to an electronic record of a check when used for purposes of a transaction governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code, i.e., the Act does not validate so-called electronic checks. However, for purposes of check retention statutes, the same electronic record of the check is covered by this Act, so that retention of an electronic image/record of a check will satisfy such retention statutes, so long as the requirements of Section 12 [G.S. 66-322] are fulfilled.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-313ol29">
       Additional exclusions under subparagraph (b)(4) should be limited to laws which govern electronic records and signatures which may be used in transactions as defined in Section 2(16) [G.S. 66-312(16)]. Records used unilaterally, or which do not relate to business, commercial (including consumer), or governmental affairs are not governed by this Act in any event, and exclusion of laws relating to such records may create unintended inferences about whether other records and signatures are covered by this Act.

      The provisions in Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] operate as free standing rules, establishing the rights of parties using Transferable Records
      <i>
       under this Act.
      </i>
      The references in Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] to UCC Section 3-302, 7-501 and 9-308 (R9-330(d)) are designed to incorporate the substance of those provisions into this act for the limited purposes noted in section 16(c) [G.S. 66-326(c)]. Accordingly, an electronic record which is also a Transferable Record, would not be used for purposes of a transaction governed by Articles 3, 4, or 9, but would be an electronic record used for purposes of a transaction governed by Section 16 [G.S. 66-326]. However, it is important to remember that those UCC Articles will still apply to the transferable record in their own right. Accordingly any other substantive requirements, e.g., method and manner of perfection under Article 9, must be complied with under those other laws. See Comments to Section 16 [G.S. 66-326].
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that Articles 2 and 2A are revised and adopted in the future, UETA will only apply to the extent provided in those Acts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In another context, subsection (c) would operate to allow this Act to apply to what would appear to be an excluded transaction under subsection (b). For example, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies generally to any transaction that creates a security interest in personal property. However, Article 9 excludes landlord’s liens. Accordingly, although this Act excludes from its application transactions subject to Article 9, this Act would apply to the creation of a landlord lien if the law otherwise applicable to landlord’s liens did not provide otherwise, because the landlord’s lien transaction is excluded from Article 9.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also important that additional exclusions, if any, be incorporated under subsection (b)(4). As noted in Comment 8 above, an electronic record used in a transaction excluded under subsection (b), e.g., a check used to pay one’s taxes, will nonetheless be validated for purposes of other, non-excluded laws under subsection (c), e.g., the check when used as proof of payment. It is critical that additional exclusions, if any, be incorporated into subsection (b) so that the salutary effect of subsection (c) apply to validate those records in other, non-excluded transactions. While a legislature may determine that a particular notice, such as a utility shutoff notice, be provided to a person in writing on paper, it is difficult to see why the utility should not be entitled to use electronic media for storage and evidentiary purposes.

     <p>
      This Section limits the applicability of this Act to transactions which parties have agreed to conduct electronically. Broad interpretation of the term agreement is necessary to assure that this Act has the widest possible application consistent with its purpose of removing barriers to electronic commerce.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol21">
       This section makes clear that this Act is intended to facilitate the use of electronic means, but does not require the use of electronic records and signatures. This fundamental principle is set forth in subsection (a) and elaborated by subsections (b) and (c), which require an intention to conduct transactions electronically and preserve the right of a party to refuse to use electronics in any subsequent transaction.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol22">
       The paradigm of this Act is two willing parties doing transactions electronically. It is therefore appropriate that the Act is voluntary and preserves the greatest possible party autonomy to refuse electronic transactions. The requirement that party agreement be found from all the surrounding circumstances is a limitation on the scope of this Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol23">
       If this Act is to serve to facilitate electronic transactions, it must be applicable under circumstances not rising to a full fledged contract to use electronics. While absolute certainty can be accomplished by obtaining an explicit contract before relying on electronic transactions, such an explicit contract should not be necessary before one may feel safe in conducting transactions electronically. Indeed, such a requirement would itself be an unreasonable barrier to electronic commerce, at odds with the fundamental purpose of this Act. Accordingly, the requisite agreement, express or implied, must be determined from all available circumstances and evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol24">
       Subsection (b) provides that the Act applies to transactions in which the parties have agreed to conduct the transaction electronically. In this context it is essential that the parties’ actions and words be broadly construed in determining whether the requisite agreement exists. Accordingly, the Act expressly provides that the party’s agreement is to be found from all circumstances, including the parties’ conduct. The critical element is the intent of a party to conduct a transaction electronically. Once that intent is established, this Act applies. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Sections 2, 3 and 19.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol25">
       Just as circumstances may indicate the existence of agreement, express or implied from surrounding circumstances, circumstances may also demonstrate the absence of true agreement. For example:
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol26">
       Subsection (c) has been added to make clear the ability of a party to refuse to conduct a transaction electronically, even if the person has conducted transactions electronically in the past. The effectiveness of a party’s refusal to conduct a transaction electronically will be determined under other applicable law in light of all surrounding circumstances. Such circumstances must include an assessment of the transaction involved.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-315ol27">
       Subsection (e) is an essential provision in the overall scheme of this Act. While this Act validates and effectuates electronic records and electronic signatures, the legal effect of such records and signatures is left to existing substantive law outside this Act except in very narrow circumstances. See, e.g., Section 16 [G.S. 66-326]. Even when this Act operates to validate records and signatures in an electronic medium, it expressly preserves the substantive rules of other law applicable to such records. See, e.g., Section 11 [G.S. 66-321].
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Examples of circumstances from which it may be found that parties have reached an agreement to conduct transactions electronically include the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The examples noted above are intended to focus the inquiry on the party’s agreement to conduct a transaction electronically. Similarly, if two people are at a meeting and one tells the other to send an e-mail to confirm a transaction — the requisite agreement under subsection (b) would exist. In each case, the use of a business card, statement at a meeting, or other evidence of willingness to conduct a transaction electronically must be viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances with a view toward broad validation of electronic transactions.
     </p>
     <p>
      A. If Automaker, Inc. were to issue a recall of automobiles via its Internet website, it would not be able to rely on this Act to validate that notice in the case of a person who never logged on to the website, or indeed, had no ability to do so, notwithstanding a clause in a paper purchase contract by which the buyer agreed to receive such notices in such a manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. Buyer executes a standard form contract in which an agreement to receive all notices electronically in [is] set forth on page 3 in the midst of other fine print. Buyer has never communicated with Seller electronically, and has not provided any other information in the contract to suggest a willingness to deal electronically. Not only is it unlikely that any but the most formalistic of agreements may be found, but nothing in this Act prevents courts from policing such form contracts under common law doctrines relating to contract formation, unconscionability and the like.
     </p>
     <p>
      A party’s right to decline to act electronically under a specific contract, on the ground that each action under that contract amounts to a separate “transaction,” must be considered in light of the purpose of the contract and the action to be taken electronically.
   For example, under a contract for the purchase of goods, the giving and receipt of notices electronically, as provided in the contract, should not be viewed as discreet transactions.
   Rather such notices amount to separate actions which are part of the “transaction” of purchase evidenced by the contract. Allowing one party to require a change of medium in the middle of the transaction evidenced by that contract is not the purpose of this subsection.
   Rather this subsection is intended to preserve the party’s right to conduct the next purchase in a non-electronic medium.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, beyond validation of records, signatures and contracts based on the medium used, Sections 7 (a) and (b) [G.S. 66-317(a) and (b)] should not be interpreted as establishing the legal effectiveness of any given record, signature or contract. Where a rule of law requires that the record contain minimum substantive content, the legal effect of such a record will depend on whether the record meets the substantive requirements of other applicable law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 8 [G.S. 66-318] expressly preserves a number of legal requirements in currently existing law relating to the presentation of information in writing. Although this Act now would allow such information to be presented in an electronic record, Section 8 [G.S. 66-318] provides that the other substantive requirements of law must be satisfied in the electronic medium as well.

       This section sets forth the fundamental premise of this Act: namely, that the medium in which a record, signature, or contract is created, presented or retained does not affect its legal significance. Subsections (a) and (b) are designed to eliminate the single element of medium as a reason to deny effect or enforceability to a record, signature, or contract. The fact that the information is set forth in an electronic, as opposed to paper, record is irrelevant.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-317ol22">
       Under Restatement 2d Contracts Section 8, a contract may have legal effect and yet be unenforceable. Indeed, one circumstance where a record or contract may have effect but be unenforceable is in the context of the Statute of Frauds. Though a contract may be unenforceable, the records may have collateral effects, as in the case of a buyer that insures goods purchased under a contract unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. The insurance company may not deny a claim on the ground that the buyer is not the owner, though the buyer may have no direct remedy against seller for failure to deliver. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 8, Illustration 4.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-317ol23">
       Subsections (c) and (d) provide the positive assertion that electronic records and signatures satisfy legal requirements for writings and signatures. The provisions are limited to requirements in laws that a record be in writing or be signed. This section does not address requirements imposed by other law in addition to requirements for writings and signatures See, e.g., Section 8 [G.S. 66-318].
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-317ol24">
       Section 8 [G.S. 66-318] addresses additional requirements imposed by other law which may affect the legal effect or enforceability of an electronic record in a particular case. For example, in section 8(a) [G.S. 66-318(a)] the legal requirement addressed is the provision of information in writing. The section then sets forth the standards to be applied in determining whether the provision of information by an electronic record is the equivalent of the provision of information in writing. The requirements in section 8 are in addition to the bare validation that occurs under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-317ol25">
       Under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction within this Act, the legal effect of an electronic record may be separate from the issue of whether the record contains a signature. For example, where notice must be given as part of a contractual obligation, the effectiveness of the notice will turn on whether the party provided the notice regardless of whether the notice was signed (See Section 15 [G.S. 66-325]). An electronic record attributed to a party under Section 9 [G.S. 66-319] and complying with the requirements of Section 15 [G.S. 66-325], would suffice in that case, notwithstanding that it may not contain an electronic signature.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      While this section would validate an electronic record for purposes of a statute of frauds, if an agreement to conduct the transaction electronically cannot reasonably be found (See Section 5(b)) [G.S. 66-315(b)] then a necessary predicate to the applicability of this Act would be absent and this Act would not validate the electronic record. Whether the electronic record might be valid under other law is not addressed by this Act.

      Subsections (c and d) are particularized applications of subsection (a).

       Illustration 1:

      A sends the following e-mail to B: “I hereby offer to buy widgets from you, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ A.” B responds with the following e-mail: “I accept your offer to buy widgets for delivery next Tuesday. /s/ B.” The e-mails may not be denied effect solely because they are electronic. In addition, the e-mails do qualify as records under the Statute of Frauds. However, because there is no quantity stated in either record, the parties’ agreement would be unenforceable under existing UCC Section 2-201(1).

      A sends the following e-mail to B: “I hereby offer to buy 100 widgets for $1000, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ A.” B responds with the following e-mail: “I accept your offer to purchase 100 widgets for $1000, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ B.” In this case the analysis is the same as in Illustration 1 except that here the records otherwise satisfy the requirements of UCC Section 2-201(1). The transaction may not be denied legal effect solely because there is not a pen and ink “writing” or “signature”.

       If parties have agreed to conduct a transaction by electronic means and a law requires a person to provide, send, or deliver information in writing to another person, the requirement is satisfied if the information is provided, sent, or delivered, as the case may be, in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt. An electronic record is not capable of retention by the recipient if:

       This section is a savings provision, designed to assure, consistent with the fundamental purpose of this act, that otherwise applicable substantive law will not be overridden by this Act. The section makes clear that while the pen and ink provisions of such other law may be satisfied electronically, nothing in this Act vitiates the other requirements of such laws. The section addresses a number of issues related to disclosures and notice provisions in other laws.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-318ol22">
       This section is independent of the prior section. Section 7 [G.S. 66-317] refers to legal requirements for a writing. This section refers to legal requirements for the provision of information in writing or relating to the method or manner of presentation or delivery of information. The section addresses more specific legal requirements of other laws, provides standards for satisfying the more particular legal requirements, and defers to other law for satisfaction of requirements under those laws.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-318ol23">
       Under subsection (a), to meet a requirement of other law that information be provided in writing, the recipient of an electronic record of the information must be able to get to the electronic record and read it, and must have the ability to get back to the information in some way at a later date. Accordingly, the section requires that the electronic record be capable of retention for later review.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-318ol24">
       Subsection (b) is a savings provision for laws which provide for the means of delivering or displaying information and which are not affected by the Act. For example, if a law requires delivery of notice by first class US mail, that means of delivery would not be affected by this Act. The information to be delivered may be provided on a disc, i.e., in electronic form, but the particular means of delivery must still be via the US postal service. Display, delivery and formatting requirements will continue to be applicable to electronic records and signatures. If those legal requirements can be satisfied in an electronic medium, e.g., the information can be presented in the equivalent of 20 point bold type as required by other law, this Act will validate the use of the medium, leaving to the other applicable law the question of whether the particular electronic record meets the other legal requirements. If a law requires that particular records be delivered together, or attached to other records, this Act does not preclude the delivery of the records together in an electronic communication, so long as the records are connected or associated with each other in a way determined to satisfy the other law.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-318ol25">
       Subsection (c) provides incentives for senders of information to use systems which will not inhibit the other party from retaining the information. However, there are circumstances where a party providing certain information may wish to inhibit retention in order to protect intellectual property rights or prevent the other party from retaining confidential information about the sender. In such cases inhibition is understandable, but if the sender wishes to enforce the record in which the information is contained, the sender may not inhibit its retention by the recipient. Unlike subsection (a), subsection (c) applies in all transactions and simply provides for unenforceability against the recipient. Subsection (a) applies only where another law imposes the writing requirement, and subsection (a) imposes a broader responsibility on the sender to assure retention capability by the recipient.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-318ol26">
       The protective purposes of this section justify the non-waivability provided by subsection (d). However, since the requirements for sending and formatting and the like are imposed by other law, to the extent other law permits waiver of such protections, there is no justification for imposing a more severe burden in an electronic environment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The section specifically provides that any inhibition on retention imposed by the sender or the sender’s system will preclude satisfaction of this section.
   Use of technological means now existing or later developed which prevents the recipient from retaining a copy the information would result in a determination that information has not been provided under subsection (a). The policies underlying laws requiring the provision of information in writing warrant the imposition of an additional burden on the sender to make the information available in a manner which will permit subsequent reference. A difficulty does exist for senders of information because of the disparate systems of their recipients and the capabilities of those systems. However, in order to satisfy the
      <i>
       legal requirement
      </i>
      of other law to make information available, the sender must assure that the recipient receives an can retain the information. However, it is left for the courts to determine whether the sender has complied with this section if evidence demonstrates that it is the recipient’s system which precludes subsequent reference to the information.

       Under subsection (a), so long as the electronic record or electronic signature resulted from a person’s action it will be attributed to that person — the legal effect of that attribution is addressed in subsection (b). This section does not alter existing rules of law regarding attribution. The section assures that such rules will be applied in the electronic environment. A person’s actions include actions taken by human agents of the person, as well as actions taken by an electronic agent, i.e., the tool, of the person. Although the rule may appear to state the obvious, it assures that the record or signature is not ascribed to a machine, as opposed to the person operating or programing the machine.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-319ol22">
       Nothing in this section affects the use of a signature as a device for attributing a record to a person. Indeed, a signature is often the primary method for attributing a record to a person. In the foregoing examples, once the electronic signature is attributed to the person, the electronic record would also be attributed to the person, unless the person established fraud, forgery, or other invalidating cause. However, a signature is not the only method for attribution.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-319ol23">
       The use of facsimile transmissions provides a number of examples of attribution using information other than a signature. A facsimile may be attributed to a person because of the information printed across the top of the page that indicates the machine from which it was sent. Similarly, the transmission may contain a letterhead which identifies the sender. Some cases have held that the letterhead actually constituted a signature because it was a symbol adopted by the sender with intent to authenticate the facsimile. However, the signature determination resulted from the necessary finding of intention in that case. Other cases have found facsimile letterheads NOT to be signatures because the requisite intention was not present. The critical point is that with or without a signature, information within the electronic record may well suffice to provide the facts resulting in attribution of an electronic record to a particular party.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-319ol24">
       Certain information may be present in an electronic environment that does not appear to attribute but which clearly links a person to a particular record. Numerical codes, personal identification numbers, public and private key combinations, all serve to establish the party to whom an electronic record should be attributed. Of course security procedures will be another piece of evidence available to establish attribution.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-319ol25">
       This section does apply in determining the effect of a “click-through” transaction. A “click-through” transaction involves a process which, if executed with an intent to “sign,” will be an electronic signature directly covered. See definition of Electronic Signature. In the context of an anonymous “click-through” issues of proof will be paramount. This section will be relevant to establish that the resulting electronic record is attributable to a particular person upon the requisite proof, including security procedures which may track the source of the click-through.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-319ol26">
       Once it is established that a record or signature is attributable to a particular party, the effect of a record or signature must be determined in light of the context and surrounding circumstances, including the parties’ agreement, if any. Also informing the effect of any attribution will be other legal requirements considered in light of the context. Subsection (b) addresses the effect of the record or signature once attributed to a person.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In each of the following cases, both the electronic record and electronic signature would be attributable to a person under subsection (a):
     </p>
     <p>
      In each of the above cases, law other than this Act would ascribe both the signature and the action to the person if done in a paper medium. Subsection (a) expressly provides that the same result will occur when an electronic medium is used.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the context of attribution of records, normally the content of the record will provide the necessary information for a finding of attribution. It is also possible that an established course of dealing between parties may result in a finding of attribution. Just as with a paper record, evidence of forgery or counterfeiting may be introduced to rebut the evidence of attribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The inclusion of a specific reference to security procedures as a means of proving attribution is salutary because of the unique importance of security procedures in the electronic environment. In certain processes, a technical and technological security procedure may be the best way to convince a trier of fact that a particular electronic record or signature was that of a particular person. In certain circumstances, the use of a security procedure to establish that the record, and related signature came from the person’s business might be necessary to overcome a claim that a hacker intervened. The reference to security procedures is not intended to suggest that other forms of proof of attribution should be accorded less persuasive effect. It is also important to recall that the particular strength of a given procedure does not affect the procedure’s status as a security procedure, but only affects the weight to be accorded the evidence of the security procedure as tending to establish attribution.

       § 66-320.
    Effect of change or error.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a change or error in an electronic record occurs in a transmission between parties to a transaction, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t66a40s66-320ol11">
       If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure, but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12">
       In an automated transaction involving an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12a">
         Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person;
        </li>
        <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12b">
         Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person’s reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record; and
        </li>
        <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c">
         Has not used or received any benefit or value from the consideration, if any, received from the other person.
         <ol>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c1">
           This section is limited to changes and errors occurring in transmissions between parties — whether person-person (paragraph 1) or in an automated transaction involving an individual and a machine (paragraphs 1 and 2). The section focuses on the effect of changes and errors occurring when records are exchanged between parties. In cases where changes and errors occur in contexts other than transmission, the law of mistake is expressly made applicable to resolve the conflict.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c2">
           Paragraph (1) deals with any transmission where the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes and errors. It operates against the non-conforming party, i.e., the party in the best position to have avoided the change or error, regardless of whether that person is the sender or recipient. The source of the error/change is not indicated, and so both human and machine errors/changes would be covered. With respect to errors or changes that would not be detected by the security procedure even if applied, the parties are left to the general law of mistake to resolve the dispute.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c3">
           Paragraph (1) applies only in the situation where a security procedure would detect the error/change but one party fails to use the procedure and does not detect the error/change. In such a case, consistent with the law of mistake generally, the record is made avoidable at the instance of the party who took all available steps to avoid the mistake. See Restatement 2d Contracts Section 152-154.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c4">
           As with paragraph (1), paragraph (2), when applicable, allows the mistaken party to avoid the effect of the erroneous electronic record. However, the subsection is limited to human error on the part of an individual when dealing with the electronic agent of the other party. In a transaction between individuals there is a greater ability to correct the error before parties have acted on it. However, when an individual makes an error while dealing with the electronic agent of the other party, it may not be possible to correct the error before the other party has shipped or taken other action in reliance on the erroneous record.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c5">
           The party acting through the electronic agent/machine is given incentives by this section to build in safeguards which enable the individual to prevent the sending of an erroneous record, or correct the error once sent. For example, the electronic agent may be programed to provide a “confirmation screen” to the individual setting forth all the information the individual initially approved. This would provide the individual with the ability to prevent the erroneous record from ever being sent. Similarly, the electronic agent might receive the record sent by the individual and then send back a confirmation which the individual must again accept before the transaction is completed. This would allow for correction of an erroneous record. In either case, the electronic agent would “provide an opportunity for prevention or correction of the error,” and the subsection would not apply. Rather, the effect of any error is governed by other law.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c6">
           Paragraph (2) also places additional requirements on the mistaken individual before the paragraph may be invoked to avoid an erroneous electronic record. The individual must take prompt action to advise the other party of the error and the fact that the individual did not intend the electronic record. Whether the action is prompt must be determined from all the circumstances including the individual’s ability to contact the other party. The individual should advise the other party both of the error and of the lack of intention to be bound (i.e., avoidance) by the electronic record received. Since this provision allows avoidance by the mistaken party, that party should also be required to expressly note that it is seeking to avoid the electronic record, i.e., lacked the intention to be bound.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c7">
           In all cases not covered by paragraphs (1) or (2), where error or change to a record occur, the parties contract, or other law, specifically including the law of mistake, applies to resolve any dispute. In the event that the parties’ contract and other law would achieve different results, the construction of the parties’ contract is left to the other law. If the error occurs in the context of record retention, Section 12 [G.S. 66-322] will apply. In that case the standard is one of accuracy and retrievability of the information.
          </li>
          <li id="t66a40s66-320ol12c8">
           Paragraph (4) makes the error correction provision in paragraph (2) and the application of the law of mistake in paragraph (3) non-variable. Paragraph (2) provides incentives for parties using electronic agents to establish safeguards for individuals dealing with them. It also avoids unjustified windfalls to the individual by erecting stringent requirements before the individual may exercise the right of avoidance under the paragraph. Therefore, there is no reason to permit parties to avoid the paragraph by agreement. Rather, parties should satisfy the paragraph’s requirements.

      The section covers both changes and errors. For example, if Buyer sends a message to Seller ordering 100 widgets, but Buyer’s information processing system changes the order to 1000 widgets, a “change” has occurred between what Buyer transmitted and what Seller received. If on the other hand, Buyer typed in 1000 intending to order only 100, but sent the message before noting the mistake, an error would have occurred which would also be covered by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Making the erroneous record avoidable by the conforming party is consistent with Sections 153 and 154 of the Restatement 2d Contracts because the non-conforming party was in the best position to avoid the problem, and would bear the risk of mistake. Such a case would constitute mistake by one party. The mistaken party (the conforming party) would be entitled to avoid any resulting contract under Section 153 because s/he does not have the risk of mistake and the non-conforming party had reason to know of the mistake.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (2) applies only to errors made by individuals. If the error results from the electronic agent it would constitute a system error. In such a case the effect of that error would be resolved under paragraph (1) if applicable, otherwise under paragraph (3) and the general law of mistake.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second, restitution is normally required in order to undo a mistaken transaction. Accordingly, the individual must also return or destroy any consideration received, adhering to instructions from the other party in any case. This is to assure that the other party retains control over the consideration sent in error.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, and most importantly in regard to transactions involving intermediaries which may be harmed because transactions cannot be unwound, the individual cannot have received any benefit from the transaction. This section prevents a party from unwinding a transaction after the delivery of value and consideration which cannot be returned or destroyed. For example, if the consideration received is information, it may not be possible to avoid the benefit conferred. While the information itself could be returned, mere access to the information, or the ability to redistribute the information would constitute a benefit precluding the mistaken party from unwinding the transaction. It may also occur that the mistaken party receives consideration which changes in value between the time of receipt and the first opportunity to return. In such a case restitution cannot be made adequately, and the transaction would not be avoidable. In each of the foregoing cases, under subparagraph (2)(c), the individual would have received the benefit of the consideration and would NOT be able to avoid the erroneous electronic record under this section.

      If a law requires a signature or record relating to a transaction to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.

      This Section permits a notary public and other authorized officers to act electronically, effectively removing the stamp/seal requirements. However, the section does not eliminate any of the other requirements of notarial laws, and consistent with the entire thrust of this Act, simply allows the signing and information to be accomplished in an electronic medium.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, Buyer wishes to send a notarized Real Estate Purchase Agreement to Seller via e-mail. The notary must appear in the room with the Buyer, satisfy him/herself as to the identity of the Buyer, and swear to that identification. All that activity must be reflected as part of the electronic Purchase Agreement and the notary’s electronic signature must appear as a part of the electronic real estate purchase contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      As another example, Buyer seeks to send Seller an affidavit averring defects in the products received. A court clerk, authorized under state law to administer oaths, is present with Buyer in a room. The Clerk administers the oath and includes the statement of the oath, together with any other requisite information, in the electronic record to be sent to the Seller. Upon administering the oath and witnessing the application of Buyer’s electronic signature to the electronic record, the Clerk also applies his electronic signature to the electronic record. So long as all substantive requirements of other applicable law have been fulfilled and are reflected in the electronic record, the sworn electronic record of Buyer is as effective as if it had been transcribed on paper.

       This section deals with the serviceability of electronic records as retained records and originals. So long as there exists reliable assurance that the electronic record accurately reproduces the information, this section continues the theme of establishing the functional equivalence of electronic and paper-based records. This is consistent with Fed.R.Evid. 1001(3) and Unif.R.Evid. 1001(3) (1974). This section assures that information stored electronically will remain effective for all audit, evidentiary, archival and similar purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol22">
       In an electronic medium, the concept of an original document is problematic. For example, as one drafts a document on a computer the “original” is either on a disc or the hard drive to which the document has been initially saved. If one periodically saves the draft, the fact is that at times a document may be first saved to disc then to hard drive, and at others vice versa. In such a case the “original” may change from the information on the disc to the information on the hard drive. Indeed, it may be argued that the “original” exists solely in RAM and, in a sense, the original is destroyed when a “copy” is saved to a disc or to the hard drive. In any event, in the context of record retention, the concern focuses on the integrity of the information, and not with its “originality.”
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol23">
       Subsection (a) requires accuracy and the ability to access at a later time. The requirement of accuracy is derived from the Uniform and Federal Rules of Evidence. The requirement of continuing accessibility addresses the issue of technology obsolescence and the need to update and migrate information to developing systems. It is not unlikely that within the span of 5-10 years (a period during which retention of much information is required) a corporation may evolve through one or more generations of technology. More to the point, this technology may be incompatible with each other necessitating the reconversion of information from one system to the other.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol24">
       Subsections (b) and (c) simply make clear that certain ancillary information or the use of third parties, does not affect the serviceability of records and information retained electronically. Again, the relevance of particular information will not be known until that information is required at a subsequent time.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol25">
       Subsection (d) continues the theme of the Act as validating electronic records as originals where the law requires retention of an original. The validation of electronic records and electronic information as originals is consistent with the Uniform Rules of Evidence. See Uniform Rules of Evidence 1001(3), 1002, 1003 and 1004.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol26">
       Subsection (e) specifically addresses particular concerns regarding check retention statutes in many jurisdictions. A Report compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston identifies hundreds of state laws which require the retention or production of original canceled checks. Such requirements preclude banks and their customers from realizing the benefits and efficiencies related to truncation processes otherwise validated under current law. The benefits to banks and their customers from electronic check retention are effectuated by this provision.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-322ol27">
       Subsections (f) and (g) generally address other record retention statutes. As with check retention, all businesses and individuals may realize significant savings from electronic record retention. So long as the standards in Section 12 [G.S. 66-322] are satisfied, this section permits all parties to obtain those benefits. As always the government may require records in any medium, however, these subsections require a governmental agency to specifically identify the types of records and requirements that will be imposed.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      For example, certain operating systems from the early 1980’s, e.g., memory typewriters, became obsolete with the development of personal computers. The information originally stored on the memory typewriter would need to be converted to the personal computer system in a way meeting the standards for accuracy contemplated by this section. It is also possible that the medium on which the information is stored is less stable. For example, information stored on floppy discs is generally less stable, and subject to a greater threat of disintegration, that information stored on a computer hard drive. In either case, the continuing accessibility issue must be satisfied to validate information stored by electronic means under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section permits parties to convert original written records to electronic records for retention so long as the requirements of subsection (a) are satisfied. Accordingly, in the absence of specific requirements to retain written records, written records may be destroyed once saved as electronic records satisfying the requirements of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The subsection refers to the information contained in an electronic record, rather than relying on the term electronic record, as a matter of clarity that the critical aspect in retention is the information itself. What information must be retained is determined by the purpose for which the information is needed. If the addressing and pathway information regarding an e-mail is relevant, then that information should also be retained. However if it is the substance of the e-mail that is relevant, only that information need be retained. Of course, wise record retention would include all such information since what information will be relevant at a later time will not be known.

      <li id="t66a40s66-324ol21">
       This section confirms that contracts can be formed by machines functioning as electronic agents for parties to a transaction. It negates any claim that lack of human intent, at the time of contract formation, prevents contract formation. When machines are involved, the requisite intention flows from the programing and use of the machine. As in other cases, these are salutary provisions consistent with the fundamental purpose of the Act to remove barriers to electronic transactions while leaving the substantive law, e.g., law of mistake, law of contract formation, unaffected to the greatest extent possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-324ol22">
       The process in paragraph (2) validates an anonymous click-through transaction. It is possible that an anonymous click-through process may simply result in no recognizable legal relationship, e.g., A goes to a person’s website and acquires access without in any way identifying herself, or otherwise indicating agreement or assent to any limitation or obligation, and the owner’s site grants A access. In such a case no legal relationship has been created.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-324ol23">
       In the transaction set forth in Comment 2, the record of the transaction also will include an electronic signature. By clicking “I agree” A adopted a process with the intent to “sign,” i.e., bind herself to a legal obligation, the resulting record of the transaction. If a “signed writing” were required under otherwise applicable law, this transaction would be enforceable. If a “signed writing” were not required, it may be sufficient to establish that the electronic record is attributable to A under section 9. Attribution may be shown in any manner reasonable including showing that, of necessity, A could only have gotten the information through the process at the website.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      On the other hand it may be possible that A’s actions indicate agreement to a particular term. For example, A goes to a website and is confronted by an initial screen which advises her that the information at this site is proprietary, that A may use the information for her own personal purposes, but that, by clicking below, A agrees that any other use without the site owner’s permission is prohibited. If A clicks “agree” and downloads the information and then uses the information for other, prohibited purposes, should not A be bound by the click? It seems the answer properly should be, and would be, yes.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the owner can show that the only way A could have obtained the information was from his website, and that the process to access the subject information required that A must have clicked the “I agree” button after having the ability to see the conditions on use, A has performed actions which A was free to refuse, which A knew would cause the site to grant her access, i.e., “complete the transaction.” The terms of the resulting contract will be determined under general contract principles, but will include the limitation on A’s use of the information, as a condition precedent to granting her access to the information.

       This section provides default rules regarding when and from where an electronic record is sent and when and where an electronic record is received. This section does not address the efficacy of the record that is sent or received. That is, whether a record is unintelligible or unusable by a recipient is a separate issue from whether that record was sent or received. The effectiveness of an illegible record, whether it binds any party, are questions left to other law.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol22">
       Subsection (a) furnishes rules for determining when an electronic record is sent. The effect of the sending and its import are determined by other law once it is determined that a sending has occurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol23">
       Subsection (b) provides simply that when a record enters the system which the recipient has designated or uses and to which it has access, in a form capable of being processed by that system, it is received. Keying receipt to a system accessible by the recipient removes the potential for a recipient leaving messages with a server or other service in order to avoid receipt. However, the section does not resolve the issue of how the sender proves the time of receipt.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol24">
       Subsections (c) and (d) provide default rules for determining where a record will be considered to have been sent or received. The focus is on the place of business of the recipient and not the physical location of the information processing system, which may bear absolutely no relation to the transaction between the parties. It is not uncommon for users of electronic commerce to communicate from one State to another without knowing the location of information systems through which communication is operated. In addition, the location of certain communication systems may change without either of the parties being aware of the change. Accordingly, where the place of sending or receipt is an issue under other applicable law, e.g., conflict of laws issues, tax issues, the relevant location should be the location of the sender or recipient and not the location of the information processing system.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol25">
       Subsection (e) makes clear that receipt is not dependent on a person having notice that the record is in the person’s system. Receipt occurs when the record reaches the designated system whether or not the recipient ever retrieves the record. The paper analog is the recipient who never reads a mail notice.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol26">
       Subsection (f) provides legal certainty regarding the effect of an electronic acknowledgment. It only addresses the fact of receipt, not the quality of the content, nor whether the electronic record was read or “opened.”
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-325ol27">
       Subsection (g) limits the parties’ ability to vary the method for sending and receipt provided in subsections (a) and (b), when there is a legal requirement for the sending or receipt. As in other circumstances where legal requirements derive from other substantive law, to the extent that the other law permits variation by agreement, this Act does not impose any additional requirements, and provisions of this Act may be varied to the extent provided in the other law.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In order to have a proper sending, the subsection requires that information be properly addressed or otherwise directed to the recipient. In order to send within the meaning of this section, there must be specific information which will direct the record to the intended recipient. Although mass electronic sending is not precluded, a general broadcast message, sent to systems rather than individuals, would not suffice as a sending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The record will be considered sent once it leaves the control of the sender, or comes under the control of the recipient. Records sent through e-mail or the internet will pass through many different server systems. Accordingly, the critical element when more than one system is involved is the loss of control by the sender.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the structure of many message delivery systems is such that electronic records may actually never leave the control of the sender. For example, within a university or corporate setting, e-mail sent within the system to another faculty member is technically not out of the sender’s control since it never leaves the organization’s server. Accordingly, to qualify as a sending, the e-mail must arrive at a point where the recipient has control. This section does not address the effect of an electronic record that is thereafter “pulled back,” e.g., removed from a mailbox. The analog in the paper world would be removing a letter from a person’s mailbox. As in the case of providing information electronically under Section 8, the recipient’s ability to receive a message should be judged from the perspective of whether the sender has done any action which would preclude retrieval. This is especially the case in regard to sending, since the sender must direct the record to a system designated or used by the recipient.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that the recipient retains control of the place of receipt, subsection (b) requires that the system be specified or used by the recipient, and that the system be used or designated for the type of record being sent. Many people have multiple e-mails for different purposes. Subsection (b) assures that recipients can designate the e-mail address or system to be used in a particular transaction. For example, the recipient retains the ability to designate a home e-mail for personal matters, work e-mail for official business, or a separate organizational e-mail solely for the business purposes of that organization. If A sends B a notice at his home which relates to business, it may not be deemed received if B designated his business address as the sole address for business purposes. Whether actual knowledge upon seeing it at home would qualify as receipt is determined under the otherwise applicable substantive law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) assures individual flexibility in designating the place from which a record will be considered sent or at which a record will be considered received. Under subsection (d) a person may designate the place of sending or receipt unilaterally in an electronic record. This ability, as with the ability to designate by agreement, may be limited by otherwise applicable law to places having a reasonable relationship to the transaction.

       A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c">
       A system satisfies subsection (b) of this section, and a person is deemed to have control of a transferable record, if the transferable record is created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c1">

             Paper negotiable instruments and documents are unique in the fact that a tangible token — a piece of paper — actually embodies intangible rights and obligations. The extreme difficulty of creating a unique electronic token which embodies the singular attributes of a paper negotiable document or instrument, dictates that the rules relating to negotiable documents and instruments not be simply amended to allow the use of an electronic record for the requisite paper writing. However, the desirability of establishing rules by which business parties might be able to acquire some of the benefits of negotiability in an electronic environment is recognized by the inclusion of this Section on Transferable Records.

            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b2">
             The definition of transferable record is limited in two significant ways. First, only the equivalent of paper promissory notes and paper documents of title can be created as transferable records. Notes and Documents of Title do not impact the broad systems that relate to the broader payments mechanisms related, for example, to checks. Impacting the check collection system by allowing for “electronic checks” has ramifications well beyond the ability of this Act. Accordingly, this Act excludes from its scope, transactions governed by UCC Articles 3 and 4. The limitation to promissory note equivalents in Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] is quite important in that regard because of the ability to deal with many enforcement issues by contract without affecting such systemic concerns.
            </li>
            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b3">
             Under Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] acquisition of “control” over an electronic record serves as a substitute for “possession” in the paper analog. More precisely, “control” under Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] serves as the substitute for delivery, indorsement and possession of a negotiable promissory note or negotiable document of title. Section 16(b) [G.S. 66-326(b)] allows control to be found so long as “a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes [the person claiming control] as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.” The key point is that a system, whether involving third party registry or technological safeguards, must be shown to reliably establish the identity of the person entitled to payment. Section 16(c) [G.S. 66-326(c)] then sets forth a safe harbor list of very strict requirements for such a system. The specific provisions listed in Section 16(c) [G.S. 66-326(c)] are derived from Section 105 of Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Generally, the transferable record must be unique, identifiable, and except as specifically permitted, unalterable. That “authoritative copy” must (i) identify the person claiming control as the person to whom the record was issued or most recently transferred, (ii) be maintained by the person claiming control or its designee, and (iii) be unalterable except with the permission of the person claiming control. In addition any copy of the authoritative copy must be readily identifiable as a copy and all revisions must be readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.
            </li>
            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b4">
             It is important to note what the Section does not provide. Issues related to enforceability against intermediate transferees and transferors (i.e., indorser liability under a paper note), warranty liability that would attach in a paper note, and issues of the effect of taking a transferable record on the underlying obligation, are NOT addressed by this section. Such matters must be addressed, if at all, by contract between and among the parties in the chain of transmission and transfer of the transferable record. In the event that such matters are not addressed by the contract, the issues would need to be resolved under otherwise applicable law. Other law may include general contract principles of assignment and assumption, or may include rules from Article 3 applied by analogy.

            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b5">
             Current business models exist which rely for their efficacy on the benefits of negotiability. A principal example, and one which informed much of the development of Section 16 [G.S. 66-326], involves the mortgage backed securities industry. Aggregators of commercial paper acquire mortgage secured promissory notes following a chain of transfers beginning with the origination of the mortgage loan by a mortgage broker. In the course of the transfers of this paper, buyers of the notes and lenders/secured parties for these buyers will intervene. For the ultimate purchaser, the ability to rely on holder in due course and a good faith purchaser status creates the legal security necessary to issue its own investment securities which are backed by the obligations evidenced by the notes purchased. Only through their HIDC status can these purchasers be assured that third party claims will be barred. Only through their HIDC status can the end purchaser avoid the incredible burden of requiring and assuring that each person in the chain of transfer has waived any and all defenses to performance which may be created during the chain of transfer.

            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b6">
             This Section is a stand-alone provision. Although references are made to specific provisions in Article 3, Article 7, and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, these provisions are incorporated into this Act and made the applicable rules for purposes of this Act. The rights of parties to transferable records are established under subsections (d) and (e). Subsection (d) provides rules for determining the rights of a party in control of a transferable record. The subsection makes clear that the rights are determined under this section, and not under other law, by incorporating the rules on the manner of acquisition into this statute. The last sentence of subsection (d) is intended to assure that requirements related to notions of possession, which are inherently inconsistent with the idea of an electronic record, are not incorporated into this statute.

            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b7">
             Subsection (e) accords to the obligor of the transferable record rights equal to those of an obligor under an equivalent paper record. Accordingly, unless a waiver of defense clause is obtained in the electronic record, or the transferee obtains HDC rights under subsection (d), the obligor has all the rights and defenses available to it under a contract assignment. Additionally, the obligor has the right to have the payment noted or otherwise included as part of the electronic record.
            </li>
            <li id="t66a40s66-326ol1c2b8">
             Subsection (f) grants the obligor the right to have the transferable record and other information made available for purposes of assuring the correct person to pay. This will allow the obligor to protect its interest and obtain the defense of discharge by payment or performance. This is particularly important because a person receiving subsequent control under the appropriate circumstances may well qualify as a holder in course who can again enforce payment of the transferable record.

             Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] is a singular exception to the thrust of this Act to simply validate electronic media used in commercial transactions. Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] actually provides a means for expanding electronic commerce. It provides certainty to lenders and investors regarding the enforceability of a new class of financial services. It is hoped that the legal protections afforded by Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] will engender the development of technological and business models which will permit realization of the significant cost savings and efficiencies available through electronic transacting in the financial services industry. Although only a bridge to more detailed consideration of the broad issues related to negotiability in an electronic context, Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] provides the impetus for that broader consideration while allowing continuation of developing technological and business models.

       Official Comment
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section provides legal support for the creation, transferability and enforceability of electronic note and document equivalents, as against the issuer/obligor. The certainty created by the section provides the requisite incentive for industry to develop the systems and processes, which involve significant expenditures of time and resources, to enable the use of such electronic documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The importance of facilitating the development of systems which will permit electronic equivalents is a function of cost, efficiency and safety for the records. The storage cost and space needed for the billions of paper notes and documents is phenomenal. Further, natural disasters can wreak havoc on the ability to meet legal requirements for retaining, retrieving and delivering paper instruments. The development of electronic systems meeting the rigorous standards of this Section will permit retention of copies which reflect the same integrity as the original. As a result storage, transmission and other costs will be reduced, while security and the ability to satisfy legal requirements governing such paper records will be enhanced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] provides for the creation of an electronic record which may be controlled by the holder who in turn may obtain the benefits of holder in due course and good faith purchaser status. If the benefits and efficiencies of electronic media are to be realized in this industry it is essential to establish a mean by which transactions involving paper promissory notes may be accomplished completely electronically. Particularly as other aspects of such transactions are accomplished electronically, the drag on the transaction of requiring a paper note becomes evident. In addition to alleviating the logistical problems of generating and storing and retrieving paper, the mailing and transmission costs associated with such transactions will also be reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second, not only is Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] limited to electronic records which would qualify as negotiable promissory notes or documents if they were in writing, but the issuer of the electronic record must expressly agree that the electronic record is to be considered a transferable record. The definition of transferable record as “an electronic record that . . . the issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record” indicates that the electronic record itself will likely set forth the issuer’s agreement, though it may be argued that a contemporaneous electronic or written record might set forth the issuer’s agreement. However, conversion of a paper note issued as such would not be possible because the issuer would not be the issuer, in such a case, of an electronic record. The purpose of such a restriction is to assure that transferable records can only be created at the time of issuance by the obligor. The possibility that a paper note might be converted to an electronic record and then intentionally destroyed, and the effect of such action, was not intended to be covered by Section 16 [G.S. 66-326].
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirement that the obligor expressly agree in the electronic record to its treatment as a transferable record does not otherwise affect the characterization of a transferable record (i.e., does not affect what would be a paper note) because it is a statutory condition. Further, it does not obligate the issuer to undertake to do any other act than the payment of the obligation evidenced by the transferable record. Therefore, it does not make the transferable record “conditional” within the meaning of Section 104(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      The control requirements may be satisfied through the use of a trusted third party registry system. Such systems are currently in place with regard to the transfer of securities entitlements under Article 8 of the UCC, and in the transfer of cotton warehouse receipts under the program sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture. This Act would recognize the use of such a system so long as the standards of subsection (c) were satisfied. In addition, a technological system which met such exacting standards would also be permitted under Section 16 [G.S. 66-326].
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, a borrower signs an electronic record which would be a promissory note or document if it were paper. The borrower specifically agrees in the electronic record that it will qualify as a transferable record under this section. The lender implements a newly developed technological system which dates, encrypts, and stores all the electronic information in the transferable record in a manner which lender can demonstrate reliably establishes lender as the person to which the transferable record was issued. In the alternative, the lender may contract with a third party to act as a registry for all such transferable records, retaining records establishing the party to whom the record was issued and all subsequent transfers of the record. An example of this latter method for assuring control is the system established for the issuance and transfer of electronic cotton warehouse receipts under 7 C.F.R. section 735 et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of greatest importance in the system used is the ability to securely and demonstrably be able to transfer the record to others in a manner which assures that only one “holder” exists. The need for such certainty and security resulted in the very stringent standards for a system outlined in subsection (c). A system relying on a third party registry is likely the most effective way to satisfy the requirements of subsection (c) that the transferable record remain unique, identifiable and unalterable, while also providing the means to assure that the transferee is clearly noted and identified.
     </p>
     <p>
      It must be remembered that Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] was drafted in order to provide sufficient legal certainty regarding the rights of those in control of such electronic records, that legal incentives would exist to warrant the development of systems which would establish the requisite control. During the drafting of Section 16 [G.S. 66-326], representatives from the Federal Reserve carefully scrutinized the impact of any electronicization of any aspect of the national payment system. Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] represents a compromise position which, as noted, serves as a bridge pending more detailed study and consideration of what legal changes, if any, are necessary or appropriate in the context of the payment systems impacted. Accordingly, Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] provides limited scope for the attainment of important rights derived from the concept of negotiability, in order to permit the development of systems which will satisfy its strict requirements for control.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, Issuer agrees to pay a debt by means of a transferable record issued to A. Unless there is agreement between issuer and A that the transferable record “suspends” the underlying obligation (see Section 3-310 of the Uniform Commercial Code), A would not be prevented from enforcing the underlying obligation without the transferable record. Similarly, if A transfers the transferable record to B by means granting B control, B may obtain holder in due course rights against the obligor/issuer, but B’s recourse against A would not be clear unless A agreed to remain liable under the transferable record. Although the rules of Article 3 may be applied by analogy in an appropriate context, in the absence of an express agreement in the transferable record or included by applicable system rules, the liability of the transferor would not be clear.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a person establishes control, Section 16(d) [G.S. 66-326(d)] provides that that person is the “holder” of the transferable record which is equivalent to a holder of an analogous paper negotiable instrument. More importantly, if the person acquired control in a manner which would make it a holder in due course of an equivalent paper record, the person acquires the rights of a HIDC. The person in control would therefore be able to enforce the transferable record against the obligor regardless of intervening claims and defenses. However, by pulling these rights into Section 16 [G.S. 66-326], this Act does NOT validate the wholesale electrification of promissory notes under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, it is important to understand that a transferable record under Section 16 [G.S. 66-326], while having no counterpart under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, would be an “account,” “general intangible,” or “payment intangible” under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Accordingly, two separate bodies of law would apply to that asset of the obligee. A taker of the transferable record under Section 16 [G.S. 66-326] may acquire purchaser rights under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, however, those rights may be defeated by a trustee in bankruptcy of a prior person in control unless perfection under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code by filing is achieved. If the person in control also takes control in a manner granting it holder in due course status, of course that person would take free of any claim by a bankruptcy trustee or lien creditor.

     <p>
      A choice of law provision in a computer information agreement which provides that the contract is to be interpreted pursuant to the laws of a state that has enacted the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, as proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, or any substantially similar law, is voidable and the agreement shall be interpreted pursuant to the laws of this State if the party against whom enforcement of the choice of law provisions is sought is a resident of this State or has its principal place of business located in this State. For purposes of this section, a “computer information agreement” means an agreement that would be governed by the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or substantially similar law as enacted in the state specified in the choice of law provisions if that state’s law were applied to the agreement. This section may not be varied by agreement of the parties. This section shall remain in force until such time as the North Carolina General Assembly enacts the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act or any substantially similar law and that law becomes effective.

       Authority. —  The Secretary of State is designated the exclusive franchising authority in this State for cable service provided over a cable system. This designation replaces the authorization to counties and cities in former G.S. 153A-137 and G.S. 160A-319 to award a franchise for cable service. This designation is effective January 1, 2007. After this date, a county or city may not award or renew a franchise for cable service.

       Award and Scope. —  The Secretary is considered to have awarded a franchise to a person who files a notice of franchise under G.S. 66-352. A franchise for cable service authorizes the holder of the franchise to construct and operate a cable system over public rights-of-way within the area to be served. Chapter 160A of the General Statutes governs the regulation of public rights-of-way by a city.

A person who provides video programming may obtain a State-issued franchise under Article 42 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.066.html" target="_blank">Chapter 66</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as enacted by this act, and thereby become subject to that Article, regardless of whether the video programming the person provides is considered cable service provided under a cable system under that Article or under federal law.”

Laws 2006-151, which revoked the authority of local governments to charge franchise taxes to cable providers and vested the State with franchising authority, violated the Dormant Commerce Clause of U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, comity principles prevented the court from granting the relief sought because (1) the franchise charges levied on cable providers by North Carolina’s political subdivisions prior to 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws 2006-151 were taxes; (2) court-ordered redistribution of intrastate taxation authority would have been an inappropriate intrusion by the federal courts into North Carolina’s tax laws, and (3) State courts provided a plain, adequate, and complete remedy for the alleged constitutional violations.

If cable service does not begin within this period, the notice of franchise terminates 130 days after it was filed. If cable service begins within this period, the holder of the State-issued franchise must file a notice of service with the Secretary within 10 days after the cable service begins. Cable service begins when it passes one or more households in the described service area. This subsection does not apply to a cable service provider who terminates an existing agreement whose franchise area includes all of the service area described in a notice of franchise filed by the provider under subsection (a) of this section.A notice of service for a service area must include all of the following:

The initial service requirements in subsection (b) of this section apply to the proposed area. If the map of the area to be served includes any area that is part of the service area of another State-issued franchise, the termination of a notice of franchise for the proposed area for failure to begin service within the required time does not affect the status of the other State-issued franchise.

       Withdrawal. —  A person may withdraw a notice of franchise by filing a notice of withdrawal with the Secretary. The notice of withdrawal must be filed at least 90 days before the service is withdrawn.

       Forfeiture. —  A person who offers cable service over a cable system without filing a notice of franchise or a notice of service as required by this Article is subject to forfeiture of the revenue received during the period of noncompliance from subscribers to the cable service in the area of noncompliance. Forfeiture does not apply to revenue received from cable service provided over a cable system in an area that is adjacent to a service area described in a notice of franchise and notice of service filed by that cable service provider under G.S. 66-352 if the provider obtains a State-issued franchise and files a notice of service that includes this area within 20 days after a civil action for forfeiture is filed. A forfeiture does not affect the liability of the cable service provider for sales tax due under G.S. 105-164.4 on cable service.A cable service provider whose area includes the area in which a person is providing cable service without complying with the notice of franchise and notice of service requirements may bring a civil action for forfeiture. The amount required to be forfeited in the action must be remitted to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund established in G.S. 115C-457.2.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2006-151, s. 17, provides that: “A primary purpose of this act is to promote consumer choice in video service providers. A premise of this goal is that increased competition will lead to improved service. Under competition, a customer who is dissatisfied with service by one cable service provider will have the option of choosing a different service provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      “G.S. 66-356, as enacted by this act, designates the Consumer Protection Division of the Attorney General’s Office as the agency to receive and respond to unresolved customer complaints about cable service provided by the holder of a State-issued franchise. The transition from local franchise agreements to State-issued franchises will occur gradually.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Due to the expected improvement in customer service and the gradual change to State-issued franchises, the impact of the requirement in new G.S. 66-356 on the staffing needs of the Consumer Protection Division is not clear. The Office of the Attorney General is therefore requested to monitor the number and type of cable service complaints it receives from customers in areas served under a local franchise agreement and from areas served under a State-issued franchise to determine whether the Consumer Protection Division needs additional staff to fulfill the duty imposed by new G.S. 66-356 and to make a report concerning staffing to the Fiscal Research Division of the North Carolina General Assembly by April 1, 2007.”

      </li>
      <li id="t66a42s66-357ol1b">
       Local Request. —  A county or city must make a written request to a cable service provider for PEG channel capacity. The request must include a statement describing the county’s or city’s plan to operate and program each channel requested. The cable service provider must provide the requested PEG channel capacity within the later of the following:

       Initial PEG Channels. —  A city with a population of at least 50,000 is allowed a minimum of three initial PEG channels plus any channels in excess of this minimum that are activated, as of July 1, 2006, under the terms of an existing franchise agreement whose franchise area includes the city. A city with a population of less than 50,000 is allowed a minimum of two initial PEG channels plus any channels in excess of this minimum that are activated, as of July 1, 2006, under the terms of an existing franchise agreement whose franchise area includes the city. For a city included in the franchise area of an existing agreement, the agreement determines the service tier placement and transmission quality of the initial PEG channels. For a city that is not included in the franchise area of an existing agreement, the initial PEG channels must be on a basic service tier, and the transmission quality of the channels must be equivalent to those of the closest city covered by an existing agreement.A county is allowed a minimum of two initial PEG channels plus any channels in excess of this minimum that are activated, as of July 1, 2006, under the terms of an existing franchise agreement whose franchise area includes the county. For a county included in the franchise area of an existing agreement, the agreement determines the service tier placement and transmission quality of the initial PEG channels. For a county that is not included in the franchise area of an existing agreement, the initial PEG channels must be on a basic service tier and the transmission quality of the channels must be equivalent to those of any city with PEG channels in the county.The cable service provider must maintain the same channel designation for a PEG channel unless the service area of the State-issued franchise includes PEG channels that are operated by different counties or cities and those PEG channels have the same channel designation. Each county and city whose PEG channels are served by the same cable system headend must cooperate with each other and with the cable system provider in sharing the capacity needed to provide the PEG channels.

      <li id="t66a42s66-357ol1d">
       Additional PEG Channels. —  A county or city that does not have seven PEG channels, including the initial PEG channels, is eligible for an additional PEG channel if it meets the programming requirements in this subsection. A county or city that has seven PEG channels is not eligible for an additional channel.A county or city that meets the programming requirements in this subsection may make a written request under subsection (b) of this section for an additional channel. The additional channel may be provided on any service tier. The transmission quality of the additional channel must be at least equivalent to the transmission quality of the other channels provided.The PEG channels operated by a county or city must meet the following programming requirements for at least 120 continuous days in order for the county or city to obtain an additional channel:
       <ol>
        <li id="t66a42s66-357ol1d1">
         All of the PEG channels must have scheduled programming for at least eight hours a day.

      <li id="t66a42s66-357ol1e">
       Use of Channels. —  If a county or city no longer provides any programming for transmission over a PEG channel it has activated, the channel may be reprogrammed at the cable service provider’s discretion. A cable service provider must give at least a 60-day notice to a county or city before it reprograms a PEG channel that is not used. The cable service provider must restore a previously lost PEG channel within 120 days of the date a county or city certifies to the provider a schedule that demonstrates the channel will be used.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a42s66-357ol1f">
       Operation of Channels. —  A cable service provider is responsible only for the transmission of a PEG channel. The county or city to which the PEG channel is provided is responsible for the operation and content of the channel. A county or city that provides content to a cable service provider for transmission on a PEG channel is considered to have authorized the provider to transmit the content throughout the provider’s service area, regardless of whether part of the service area is outside the boundaries of the county or city.All programming on a PEG channel must be noncommercial. A cable service provider may not brand content on a PEG channel with its logo, name, or other identifying marks. A cable service provider is not required to transmit content on a PEG channel that is branded with the logo, name, or other identifying marks of another cable service provider.

        Broker and Pawnbroker Distinguished. —

      </p>
      <p>
       There is a great difference between the terms “broker” and “pawnbroker.” A broker is an agent, middleman or negotiator, who works for a commission. A pawnbroker is not an agent at all. He is one who lends the money upon personalty pledged as security. Brokers and pawnbrokers constitute distinct classes, and entirely different license taxes may be assessed upon them.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no pawnbroker has the authority enumerated in this section unless he has fully complied with the laws regulating the particular transactions involved.

The applicant’s fingerprints shall be forwarded to the State Bureau of Investigation for a search of the State’s criminal history record file, and the State Bureau of Investigation shall forward a set of the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. The agency shall keep all information pursuant to this subsection privileged, in accordance with applicable State law and federal guidelines, and the information shall be confidential and shall not be a public record under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.The Department of Public Safety may charge each applicant a fee for conducting the checks of criminal history records authorized by this subsection.The filing fee for a special occasion permit application is one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00) to provide for the administrative cost of the local law enforcement agency including purchase of required forms and the cost of conducting the criminal history record check of the applicant. The fee is not refundable even if the permit is denied or is later suspended or revoked. A special occasion permit is in addition to and not in lieu of other business licenses and is not transferable. No person other than the dealer named on the permit and that dealer’s employees may engage in the business of purchasing precious metals under the authority of the permit.A special occasion permit is valid for 12 months from the date issued, unless earlier surrendered, suspended, or revoked. Application for renewal of a permit for an additional 12 months shall be on a form approved by the Department of Public Safety and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable renewal fee of one hundred eighty dollars ($180.00).Each special occasion permit shall be posted in a prominent place on the premises of any show at which the permittee purchases precious metals.

      Before any permit shall be issued to a dealer pursuant to G.S. 66-407, the dealer shall execute a satisfactory cash or surety bond or establish a trust account with a licensed and insured bank or savings institution located in the State of North Carolina in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The bond or trust account shall be in favor of the State of North Carolina. A surety bond is to be executed by the dealer and by two responsible sureties or a surety company licensed to do business in the State of North Carolina and shall be on a form approved by the Department of Public Safety. Any bond shall be kept in full force and effect and shall be delivered to the law-enforcement agency which first issued a current permit to the dealer. A bond or trust account shall be for the faithful performance of the requirements and obligations of the dealer’s business in conformity with this Part. Any law-enforcement agency shall have full power and authority to revoke the permit and sue for forfeiture of the bond or trust account upon a breach thereof. Any person who shall have suffered any loss or damage by any act of the permittee that constitutes a violation of this Part shall have the right to institute an action to recover against such permittee and the surety or trust account.

       Every dealer to whom a permit has been issued pursuant to G.S. 66-407 shall maintain consecutively numbered records of each precious metals transaction. Each consecutively numbered record shall be made at the time of the transaction and shall contain a clear and accurate description of the transaction. A valid description shall include each of the following applicable and available items of information: the manufacturer’s name, the model, the model number, the serial number, and any engraved numbers or initials found on the items; the date of the transaction; the name, sex, race, residence, telephone number and driver’s license number of the person selling the items purchased; and the signature of both the dealer or registered employee and the seller. In the event the seller cannot furnish valid, unexpired photographic identification in the form of a drivers license, State-issued identification card, passport, or military identification card, the dealer shall require two forms of positive identification.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a45p02s66-410ol1b">
       The consecutively numbered records required by this section shall be kept either (i) in a paginated, bound book or set of books with pages numbered in sequence or (ii) in an electronic database that prevents record deletion, tracks all modifications to records, and provides for electronic signatures.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a45p02s66-410ol1c">
       The records shall be open at all reasonable times to inspection on the premises by law enforcement agencies, and an individual record shall be retained for at least two years after a transaction. If a dealer maintains a record book rather than an electronic database, the book shall be retained until at least two years following the last  recorded transaction.
      </li>
      <li id="t66a45p02s66-410ol1d">
       A copy of each consecutively numbered record entry shall be filed within 48 hours of the transaction in the office of the local law enforcement agency. Records shall be filed in the manner authorized by the local law enforcement agency, which may include reporting electronically by transmission over a computer network, by facsimile machine, or by hand delivering hard copies to the local law enforcement agency. In any case where a technological failure prevents a dealer from reporting electronically or by facsimile, the dealer shall have the option of hand delivering a hard copy of the record to the local law enforcement agency. Regardless of the manner in which the local law enforcement agency allows reporting, a dealer shall provide a hard copy of records upon the request of a law enforcement agency.

      <li id="t66a45p02s66-410ol1e">
       The files of local law enforcement agencies that contain copies of records shall not be subject to inspection and examination as authorized by G.S. 132-6. Any public official or employee who shall knowingly and willfully permit any person to have access to or custody or possession of any portion of such files, unless the person is one specifically authorized by the local law enforcement agency to have access for purposes of law enforcement investigation or civil or criminal proceedings, shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and upon conviction shall only be fined up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) in the discretion of the court.

The notice shall state the effective date of the cancellation and the reason for the cancellation. If a vehicle value protection agreement is cancelled by the provider for a reason other than nonpayment of the provider fee, the provider shall refund to the contract holder one hundred percent (100%) of the unearned pro rata provider fee paid by the contract holder, if any.
