      </p>
      <p>
       This section is an express provision, and there is no rule of construction or principle of constitutional law by which an express provision can be abrogated and made of no force by an implication from any other provision of the instrument. The clauses should be construed so as to give effect to each, and prevent conflict. This is done by giving to N.C. Const., Art. XII, § 1, the effect of allowing military possession of a county to be taken, and the arrest of all suspected persons to be made by military authority, but requiring, by force of N.C. Const., Art. I, § 21, the persons arrested to be surrendered for trial to the civil authorities, on habeas corpus, should they not be delivered over without the writ.

        Court Is Not Permitted to Act as One of Errors and Appeals. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In habeas corpus proceedings, the court is not permitted to act as one of errors and appeals, but the right to afford relief, on such hearings, arises only when the petitioner is held unlawfully or on a sentence manifestly entered by the court without power to impose it. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Habeas corpus is not available as a substitute for appeal.
   
   In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment must be void as distinguished from erroneous.
   
   In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962); Brown v. North Carolina, 341 F.2d 87, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6859 (4th Cir. 1965).

       <b>
        As Where Court Had No Jurisdiction or Judgment Was Not Authorized by Law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In habeas corpus proceedings, the court has jurisdiction to discharge petitioner only when the record discloses that the court which imprisoned him did not have jurisdiction of the offense or of the person of defendant, or that the judgment was not authorized by law. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Habeas corpus relief may be obtained only on determination that the court which imprisoned the petitioner did not have jurisdiction of the offense or of the prisoner, or that judgment was not authorized by law. Brown v. North Carolina, 341 F.2d 87, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6859 (4th Cir. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only questions open to inquiry are whether on the record the court which imposed the sentence had jurisdiction of the matter or had exceeded its powers. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordering two habeas petitioners’ release was error where they were held due to an immigration-related process by a sheriff who was a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Thus, the court’s state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of petitioners’ detentions had been superseded by federal law. Although the trial court had authority to make an initial determination as to its authority, an examination of the applications themselves should have led it to summarily deny the habeas corpus petitions. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 500 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a trial judge presented with an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon any such petition, it should (1) summarily deny an application seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus that alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government and (2) deny a petitioner’s request for discharge in the event that the return filed by a sheriff who has entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government claims that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 500 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sole question for determination
   
   at habeas corpus hearing for alleged unlawful imprisonment is whether petitioner is then being unlawfully restrained of his liberty. In re Burton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 534</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 581, 1962 N.C. LEXIS 386 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one is actually confined for a longer term of imprisonment than is legal,
   
   a writ of habeas corpus will issue to the end that a proper sentence may be imposed. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 600</cite>, 1881 N.C. LEXIS 339 (1881), overruled, Dantzic v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 212</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 563, 1971 N.C. LEXIS 770 (1971).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant, charged with the crime of burglary with intent to commit murder, consented to a mistrial and pleaded “guilty of larceny,” and was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary, a writ of habeas corpus will issue, in order that he may be taken from the penitentiary and held to answer the charge in the court below.

       Where a defendant punished for direct contempt contends that a legal right has been denied him, and it is made to appear that the court was without jurisdiction of the cause or power to impose the sentence, his remedy is by habeas corpus proceedings, taken to the Supreme Court, if necessary, by writ of certiorari. State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 743</cite>, 94 S.E. 680, 1917 N.C. LEXIS 450 (1917).

       Proceedings to obtain control of a minor child
   
   between persons with whom the child had been placed for adoption and welfare officers seeking to place the child with his family are not proceedings under this section, to set the infant free but are proceedings to fix and determine the right of custody.

       A soldier actually and rightfully in the army can have no relief by the writ of habeas corpus against any abuse of military authority, and if he is wrongfully held as a soldier, he is not entitled to a habeas corpus while he is undergoing punishment or awaiting trial for a military offense.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although an applicant for a writ of habeas corpus alleged that a parole agreement required the applicant’s release, the applicant failed to present adequate factual support for this contention. Thus, the trial court did not err by summarily denying the applicant’s request, given that the applicant failed to establish that the applicant had a colorable claim to be entitled to discharge from custody based on an alleged deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process of law. State v. Leach, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 399, 742 S.E.2d 608, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 536 (2013).

       Trial court’s ruling on a habeas petition that the twins defendant was charged with killing did not meet the born-alive rule, leaving the trial court without jurisdiction to order defendant held without bail, improperly usurped the jury’s duty to weigh the evidence on that issue. As the court exceeded its authority, the order issued was void. State v. Chapman, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 747 S.E.2d 114, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C.

       In a proceeding wherein there was no question of the superior court having jurisdiction of the offense and of the person of the defendant, and the power to render the judgment imposed, the defendant was not entitled to relief by habeas corpus on the ground that the record failed to show that a verdict was rendered in the case or that he had entered any plea, since any omissions in the minutes of the court with respect to procedure followed during the course of trial could be amended by the court.

       In construing the term, “final judgment or decree of a competent tribunal,”
   
   it has come to be well understood that the exception refers only to judgments warranted by the law applicable to the case in hand, and where it appears from an inspection of the record proper and the judgment itself that the court had no jurisdiction of the cause and was manifestly without power to enter the judgment or impose the sentence in question, in such case there would be no final sentence of a competent tribunal, and the exception established by the statute does not obtain.

       Without reference to the positive prohibition of this section, it is otherwise clear that the power cannot extend to cases where the person is confined on final process. For if so, this unseemly and discordant result would follow, that one superior court judge might try and sentence a person to death or the penitentiary, and another might issue the writ of habeas corpus and discharge the prisoner. Results so disgraceful and destructive to the orderly and harmonious administration of justice were never contemplated by the framers of our judicial system; on the contrary, they were carefully guarded against, both by the Constitution and legislation.

       If a case comes before the Supreme Court by appeal, or by certiorari, and upon the trial it appears that the prisoner was suffering an illegal confinement in the penitentiary, it would be the duty of that court, by virtue of its supervisory power, and of this section, enacted to carry into effect this constitutional power of the Supreme Court, to issue the writ of habeas corpus, even of its own motion, and discharge the prisoner.

       Although an applicant for a writ of habeas corpus alleged that a parole agreement required the applicant’s release, the applicant failed to present adequate factual support for this contention. Thus, the trial court did not err by summarily denying the applicant’s request, given that the applicant failed to establish that the applicant had a colorable claim to be entitled to discharge from custody based on an alleged deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process of law.

       The attachment warranted by this section does not rest on the idea of punishing for a contempt of the judge, or court, but of compelling a return to the writ and a production of a body. It is a substitute for the provision in the old Habeas Corpus Act, which punished the officer or person refusing or neglecting to make due return, “upon conviction by indictment,” with a fine of $500 for the first offense, and of $1,000, and incapacity to hold office, for the second.

    Authority to issue the writ.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every court of record has power, upon the application of any party to any suit or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending in such court, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, for the purpose of bringing before the said court any prisoner who may be detained in any jail or prison within the State, for any cause, except a prisoner under sentence for a capital felony, to be examined as a witness in such suit or proceeding in behalf of the party making the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any magistrate or clerk of the superior court, upon application as provided in this section, to bring any person confined in the jail or prison of the same county where such magistrate or clerk may reside, to be examined as a witness before such magistrate or clerk.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where the testimony of any prisoner is needed in a proceeding before a magistrate, or a clerk, and such person is confined in a county in which such magistrate or clerk does not reside, application for habeas corpus to testify may be made to any justice or judge of the General Court of Justice.

       The right to bring a person, whose presence is necessary, before a court for the exercise of its powers is inherent in every court of general jurisdiction, and its exercise is essential to the preservation of its power and dignity.

      <p>
       One who has been convicted of murder, and is under sentence of death, is a competent witness; and the solicitor (now district attorney) for the State is entitled to a habeas corpus to bring such condemned prisoner into court for the purpose of testifying before the grand jury. Ex parte Harris, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 65</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS 15 (1875).

      <p>
       When the State has procured the attendance of a witness under sentence of death, the objection by the defendant that he could not be procured by writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum under this section is untenable, this not applying to the State; nor will objection avail that the time set for the execution had passed, and the witness, being dead in the eyes of the law, could not testify, the witness having been present and having testified.
