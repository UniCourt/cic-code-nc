   <p>
    Session Laws 2008-83, s. 2, provides: “The UNC-CH Division TEACCH Autism Program (TEACCH), in consultation with the School of Government and the Autism Society of NC, shall develop a video to raise awareness of autism for those involved in government and public service, including information on recognizing the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, and contacts for further information on appropriate responses to individuals with autism.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 1, provides: “It is the intent of the General Assembly to refer to a person with a disability as a person first when directing the drafting of statutes and resolutions. The Legislative Services Office shall incorporate into its drafting training of legislative drafters the preference to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. The Arc of North Carolina shall provide a list of nationally recognized descriptors to the Legislative Services Office to be used in this training.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 2, provides: “The General Statutes Commission shall recommend to the 2010 reconvened session of the 2009 General Assembly and to the 2011 Regular Session of the General Assembly any statutory changes and drafting policies needed to make the General Statutes and administrative rules refer to a person with a disability as a person first. The goal of such revisions shall be to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. In making recommendations, the General Statutes Commission shall distinguish those instances where a word or phrase is required by federal law or regulation, is describing a medical diagnosis, or is referring to nonliving entities such as facilities, organizations, programs, services, or zone designations.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.21D(a)-(i), as amended by Session Laws 2010-31, s. 10.9, provides: “(a) There is established the Joint Study Committee on Autism Spectrum Disorder and Public Safety (Committee). The Committee shall consist of members and co-chairs appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Committee and the terms of the members shall expire when the Committee submits a final report to the General Assembly. Members serve at the pleasure of the appointing officer.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(b) The Committee shall study ways to increase the availability of appropriate autism-specific education and training to public safety personnel, first responder units, judges, district attorneys, magistrates, and related organizations. The Committee may also study any other issue it deems relevant to Autism Spectrum Disorder and public safety.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(c) The Committee shall meet upon the call of its co-chairs. A quorum of the Committee is a majority of its members. No action may be taken except by a majority vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(d) The Committee, while in the discharge of its official duties, may exercise all powers provided for under G.S. 120-19 and Article 5A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The Committee may contract for professional, clerical, or consultant services, as provided by G.S. 120-32.02.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(e) Members of the Committee shall receive per diem, subsistence, and travel allowance as provided in G.S. 120-3.1, and G.S. 138-5 and G.S. 138-6, as appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(f) The expenses of the Committee shall be considered expenses incurred for the joint operation of the General Assembly. Funds for the Committee shall be as appropriated to the General Assembly for this purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(g) The Legislative Services Officer shall assign professional and clerical staff to assist the Committee in its work. The Director of Legislative Assistants of the House of Representatives and the Director of Legislative Assistants of the Senate shall assign clerical support staff to the Committee.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(h) The Committee may meet at various locations around the State in order to promote greater public participation in its deliberations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(i) The Committee may submit an interim report on the results of its study, including any proposed legislation, to the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives on or before May 1, 2010, by filing a copy of the report with the Office of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Library. The Committee shall submit a final report on the results of its study, including any proposed legislation, to the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives upon the completion of its work by filing a copy of the report with the Office of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Library. The Committee shall terminate upon the completion of its work.”

     Legislative Intent. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Both the plain language of its provisions and the legislative history surrounding this act indicate that the legislature did not intend to protect persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) under this particular act. Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 205</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 134, 1990 N.C. LEXIS 11 (1990).

     Act Does Not Protect Asymptomatic Persons Infected with HIV. —

   <p>
    A person who is infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but who is otherwise asymptomatic, is not entitled to protection under the provisions of this act. Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 205</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 134, 1990 N.C. LEXIS 11 (1990).
   </p>
   <p>
    Plaintiff’s claim was not filed within a reasonable time
   
   after the former Handicapped Persons Act right to employment statute was repealed and the new Act was enacted; since “reasonable time” cannot exceed the limitations period allowed under the new law, plaintiff had 180 days after the new Act became effective in which to sue, and plaintiff failed to file within that time period.

    <li id="t168As168A-2ol1a">
     The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure equality of opportunity, to promote independent living, self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency, and to encourage and enable all persons with disabilities to participate fully to the maximum extent of their abilities in the social and economic life of the State, to engage in remunerative employment, to use available public accommodations and public services, and to otherwise pursue their rights and privileges as inhabitants of this State.
    </li>
    <li id="t168As168A-2ol1b">
     The General Assembly finds that: the practice of discrimination based upon a disabling condition is contrary to the public interest and to the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity; the practice of discrimination on the basis of a disabling condition threatens the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of this State; and such discrimination results in a failure to realize the productive capacity of individuals to their fullest extent.

    A visually impaired plaintiff could not bring suit under Article I, § 19 of the North Carolina Constitution, as this section provides an adequate state remedy for the plaintiff’s allegation that a judge discriminated against him by refusing to allow his companion dog to accompany him into the judge’s courtroom, and having failed to timely use this remedy, he could not call on the court to fashion one under the state constitution.

   notwithstanding the repeal of G.S. 168-6, where it was clear that the complaint was sufficient to put the defendants on notice of the events or transactions which produced the claim, and even though the General Assembly did not include a saving clause in the repeal of G.S. 168-6, the same remedy was immediately available to the plaintiff for the same injury in the new act, without any intervening period in which the plaintiff’s claim was without legal redress.
