    This Chapter provides protection for merchants who merely sell products while allowing the purchaser of the product to proceed against the manufacturer of the product. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 845 F. Supp. 1122, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11295 (M.D.N.C. 1994).

    <b>
     The North Carolina legislature intended to establish a fixed cut-off date
    </b>
    to bar actions brought after six years involving an injury caused by a manufactured good. A defendant escapes liability if the action is not brought within the six-year window provided by G.S. 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)). Lindsay v. Public Serv. Co., 725 F. Supp. 278, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13901 (W.D.N.C. 1989), dismissed, 732 F. Supp. 623, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2896 (W.D.N.C. 1990).

    <b>
     With No Exception for Failure to Warn. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The statute of repose, G.S. 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)), as incorporated into this Chapter, the North Carolina products liability statute, anticipates that the statute includes any action brought for or on account of personal injury. Specifically, the statute includes those injuries caused by or resulting from a warning or lack thereof. Thus, the statute of repose contains no exception for failure to warn. Lindsay v. Public Serv. Co., 725 F. Supp. 278, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13901 (W.D.N.C. 1989), dismissed, 732 F. Supp. 623, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2896 (W.D.N.C. 1990).

    Action against defendant pharmaceutical manufacturers for plaintiff’s personal injury (tardive dyskinesia) allegedly caused by or resulting from the manufacturers’ inadequate warnings associated with a name-brand drug, though brought under a myriad of claims—including negligence. breach of undertaking special duty, misrepresentation by omission, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, fraud by concealment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranties—clearly fell within North Carolina’s definition of a product liability action under G.S. 99B-1(3). Couick v. Wyeth, Inc., 691 F. Supp. 2d 643, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20393 (W.D.N.C. 2010).

   <p>
    Section 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)) was enacted with this Chapter to provide a period of limitations for actions to which this Chapter applies. Bernick v. Jurden, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 435</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 405, 1982 N.C. LEXIS 1448 (1982).

     Statute of Repose. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    This section does not completely eviscerate the statute of repose in the case of minors and others under disability. If a product is over six years old at the time of injury, which would be the time that the claim accrues, than the statute of repose operates as a total bar on that claim; however, if a claim accrues before the six year statute of repose has expired, this section simply operates to extend the time period within which a minor or other with disability may bring suit under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.099B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 99B</a></cite>. Therefore, claims accruing after six years will still be barred. Bryant v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 448 S.E.2d 832, <cite class="nc_code">1994 N.C.

    Where third party plaintiff claimed it was entitled to maintain an action under the Products Liability Act that would fall within the exception to the privity requirement in the context of breach or implied warranty, but did not allege that defects in the voice mail system resulted in any physical injury or property damage and only alleged economic loss, the general rule regarding privity remained intact and third party plaintiff could not maintain its breach of implied warranty claim.

   </p>
   <p>
    The implied warranty of merchantability arises under the UCC upon the sale of goods when the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of the kind sold. The term “product liability action” as used in the Products Liability Act includes “any action brought for or on account of personal injury, death or property damage caused by or resulting from . . . the selling . . . of any product.” Therefore, an action of breach of implied warranty of merchantability under the UCC is a “product liability action” within the meaning of the Products Liability Act if the action is for injury to person or property resulting from the sale of a product. Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 298</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 495, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 1925 (1987).

     Subsection (a) as Defense in Breach of Implied Warranty Actions. —

   </p>
   <p>
    In products liability actions arising from breaches of implied warranties, unlike those arising from breaches of express warranties, the defenses provided by subsection (a) are available to defendants. Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 298</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 495, 1987 N.C. LEXIS 1925 (1987).

    <b>
     Intent of Defenses. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The defenses established in this section were intended to limit the liability of merchants who merely sell products without any knowledge of any defect in the product. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 845 F. Supp. 1122, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11295 (M.D.N.C. 1994).

     Act Held Inapplicable to Purchaser’s Employee. —

   </p>
   <p>
    The protections of the Products Liability Act would not extend to the employee of a purchaser where the employee was covered by workers’ compensation insurance. Davis v. Siloo Inc., <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 267 S.E.2d 354, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3083 (1980).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where it was undisputed that plaintiff ’s employer purchased potato whitener for use in store, plaintiff used the product in her work, and plaintiff was covered by the Worker’s Compensation Act, this section prevented plaintiff from being a claimant on an implied warranty theory against the manufacturer; therefore, defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the implied warranty was properly granted. Sutton v. Major Prods. Co., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 372 S.E.2d 897, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 901 (1988).
   </p>
   <p>
    Essential elements of an action for products liability
   
   based upon negligence include: (1) Evidence of a standard of care owed by the reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances; (2) breach of that standard of care; (3) injury caused directly or proximately by the breach, and; (4) loss because of the injury. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C.

    <b>
     Purely Economic Loss. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Where third party plaintiff claimed it was entitled to maintain an action under the Products Liability Act that would fall within the exception to the privity requirement in the context of breach or implied warranty, but did not allege that defects in the voice mail system resulted in any physical injury or property damage and only alleged economic loss, the general rule regarding privity remained intact and third party plaintiff could not maintain its breach of implied warranty claim. AT &amp; T Corp. v. Medical Review of N.C. Inc., 876 F. Supp. 91, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1999 (E.D.N.C. 1995).

    <b>
     Privity Requirement. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    This Chapter (products liability) expressly abrogates privity requirement in certain claims based upon implied warranty. However, outside exceptions created by this Chapter, general rule is that privity is required to assert claim for breach of implied warranty involving only economic loss. Sharrard, McGee &amp; Co. v. Suz's Software, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 396 S.E.2d 815, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1041 (1990).
   </p>
   <p>
    Employee who brought a products liability suit pursuant to G.S. 99B-1(3) was required to proffer evidence from which the jury could find that his employer purchased the manhole cover in question because, under the express terms of G.S. 99B-2(b), the employee could maintain an action for breach of implied warranties only against a manufacturer, and only if he was a buyer of the product in question or an employee of the buyer. McLaurin v. E. Jordan Iron Works, Inc., 666 F. Supp. 2d 590, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100226 (E.D.N.C. 2009), aff'd, 410 Fed. Appx. 630, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 2718 (4th Cir. 2011).

   <p>
    North Carolina’s Products Liability Act relaxes the privity requirement with respect to a claim for breach of implied warranty. AT &amp; T Corp. v. Medical Review of N.C. Inc., 876 F. Supp. 91, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1999 (E.D.N.C. 1995).
   </p>
   <p>
    Trial court did not err in dismissing general contractor’s breach of implied warranty claims against the manufacturer because there was no privity. Since the generators were installed as a component part of the system, the plant only suffered economic loss and, pursuant to G.S. 99B-2(b), of the North Carolina Products Liability Act, in order for the general contractor to maintain an action against the manufacturer there had to be privity. Atl. Coast Mech., Inc. v. Arcadis, Geraghty &amp; Miller of N.C. Inc., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 623 S.E.2d 334, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 58 (2006).

     Privity Not Abolished for Employee. —

    <b>
     Seller Representing Itself as Manufacturer Is Not Protected. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Trial court erred in granting summary judgment for seller because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether seller was the apparent manufacturer of the heaters; a seller who holds himself out to the public as the manufacturer of a product is not protected from products liability actions by subsection (a) of this section. Warzynski v. Empire Comfort Sys., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 401 S.E.2d 801, <cite class="nc_code">1991 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 288 (1991).

   <p>
    <b>
     Principles of Negligence Govern. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    In products liability cases, the duty of the manufacturer in tort must be determined by the principles of negligence. The doctrine of strict liability, except for a few exceptional situations, has not been adopted. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2770 (1982), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 695</cite>, 300 S.E.2d 374, 1983 N.C. LEXIS 1116 (1983) (decided under law applicable prior to effective date of this Chapter).
   </p>
   <p>
    The failure of manufacturers and distributors to properly inform purchasers of a product’s hazards,
   
   uses, and misuses is a basis for rendering them legally liable for injuries resulting therefrom under some circumstances. Millikan v. Guilford Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 705, 320 S.E.2d 909, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3894 (1984), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 798</cite>, 325 S.E.2d 631, 1985 N.C. LEXIS 1735 (1985).

    <b>
     No Duty to Inspect. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Products liability claims of negligence and breach of implied warranty against a distributor could not stand because the distributor had no duty, pursuant to G.S. 99B-2(a), nor any reasonable opportunity, to perform diagnostic tests on U-bolts that would have revealed latent defects. McLaurin v. E. Jordan Iron Works, Inc., 666 F. Supp. 2d 590, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100226 (E.D.N.C. 2009), aff'd, 410 Fed. Appx. 630, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 2718 (4th Cir. 2011).

     Liability for Sale of Inherently Dangerous Product. —

   </p>
   <p>
    Manufacturer of a machine which is dangerous because of the way in which it functions,
   
   and patently so, owes to those who use it a duty merely to make it free from latent defects and concealed dangers. In a case against such a manufacturer, the plaintiff must prove the existence of a latent defect or of a danger not known to the plaintiff or other users. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C.

     Protection Against Obvious Defects Not Required. —

   <p>
    A manufacturer has no duty to equip his product with safety devices to protect against defects and dangers that are obvious. In cases dealing with a manufacturer’s liability for injuries to remote users, the courts have always stressed the duty of guarding against hidden defects and of giving notice of concealed dangers. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C.

    Where 1964 Volkswagen occupied by decedents and designed, manufactured and distributed by VW, burst into flames due to an allegedly defective gas tank when it was struck by a 1972 Dodge being operated on the wrong side of the highway, and it was not alleged that the defective gas tank caused the collision, the district court erred in denying VW’s motions for dismissal and for summary judgment in a suit to recover damages for the wrongful deaths of decedents as a result of the alleged failure of VW to design a crashworthy vehicle.

    Seller’s advertisement that it sold “America’s most complete line of reliable, economical gas heating appliances” was, under the Uniform Commercial Code, “a statement purporting to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create warranty.” Seller’s statement that the heater was “reliable” could not be regarded by the buyers to be part of the reason for their purchase; therefore, the language in seller’s advertisement was mere puffing and not an express warranty.

    When it was alleged that a minor was injured by a defective seat belt system, and G.S. 99B-3 provided a defense to a manufacturer when a “party” altered or modified an allegedly defective product after the product left the manufacturer, it was error to grant the minor a directed verdict that the defense was not available to the system’s manufacturer because (1) sufficient evidence allowed a jury to find the minor’s father modified the seat belt system before the minor’s injuries, and (2) this evidence sustained a judgment applying the statute to relieve the manufacturer of liability.

    When it was alleged that a minor was injured by a defective seat belt system, a manufacturer could assert the defense provided in G.S. 99B-3, when a “party” altered or modified an allegedly defective product after the product left the manufacturer, because, as used in the statute, the word “party” was not limited to a party to the litigation, since (1) the word’s use showed the general assembly intended the term to include anyone altering the product, whether or not a party to the litigation, subject to other statutory requirements, (2) one altering the product became a “party,” as used in the statute, at the time of modification, before any litigation, showing the defense applied when anyone other than a manufacturer or seller altered the product, (3) this interpretation was consistent with pattern jury instructions and scholarly commentary, and (4) limiting “party” to a party to the litigation read words into the statute that the general assembly chose not to use.

    North Carolina law allows any foreseeable user to state a claim for breach of warranty, but this contention holds true only for claims based on inadequate warning or instruction for a product, pursuant to G.S. 99B-5.

    In a failure to warn product liability action against a taser manufacturer by the administrator of a decedent’s estate, the district court did not err in denying the manufacturer’s motion for judgment as a matter of law because there was sufficient evidence that the failure to warn taser users to avoid deploying the taser’s electrical current in proximity to the heart was the proximate cause of the decedent’s death and that the manufacturer’s warning was not adequate as a matter of law.

    Where a worker sued a clamp manufacturer after the worker was injured when a clamp failed on an irrigation system, the trial court properly directed a verdict in favor of the manufacturer on the worker’s claim that the manufacturer was liable for failing to provide adequate warnings regarding the clamp, as the worker proffered no evidence that the manufacturer’s failure to provide the warnings that were suggested by the worker’s expert was the proximate cause of the worker’s injuries.

   <p>
    In plaintiff’s products liability suit against the manufacturer of a vaginal mesh, the district court did not err by awarding partial summary judgment for defendant on the failure to warn claim because plaintiff did not present evidence that any allegedly inadequate warnings caused her injuries; plaintiff cited no evidence establishing that either she or her doctor so much as read the allegedly inadequate warning.

     No manufacturer of a product shall be held liable in any product liability action for the inadequate design or formulation of the product unless the claimant proves that at the time of its manufacture the manufacturer acted unreasonably in designing or formulating the product, that this conduct was a proximate cause of the harm for which damages are sought, and also proves one of the following:
     <ol>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1a1">
       At the time the product left the control of the manufacturer, the manufacturer unreasonably failed to adopt a safer, practical, feasible, and otherwise reasonable alternative design or formulation that could then have been reasonably adopted and that would have prevented or substantially reduced the risk of harm without substantially impairing the usefulness, practicality, or desirability of the product.
      </li>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1a2">
       At the time the product left the control of the manufacturer, the design or formulation of the product was so unreasonable that a reasonable person, aware of the relevant facts, would not use or consume a product of this design.

    </li>
    <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b">
     In determining whether the manufacturer acted unreasonably under subsection (a) of this section, the factors to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
     <ol>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b1">
       The nature and magnitude of the risks of harm associated with the design or formulation in light of the intended and reasonably foreseeable uses, modifications, or alterations of the product.
      </li>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b2">
       The likely awareness of product users, whether based on warnings, general knowledge, or otherwise, of those risks of harm.
      </li>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b3">
       The extent to which the design or formulation conformed to any applicable government standard that was in effect when the product left the control of its manufacturer.
      </li>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b4">
       The extent to which the labeling for a prescription or nonprescription drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration conformed to any applicable government or private standard that was in effect when the product left the control of its manufacturer.
      </li>
      <li id="t99Bs99B-6ol1b5">
       The utility of the product, including the performance, safety, and other advantages associated with that design or formulation.

     No manufacturer of a product shall be held liable in any product liability action for a claim under this section to the extent that it is based upon an inherent characteristic of the product that cannot be eliminated without substantially compromising the product’s usefulness or desirability and that is recognized by the ordinary person with the ordinary knowledge common to the community.

     No manufacturer of a prescription drug shall be liable in a product liability action on account of some aspect of the prescription drug that is unavoidably unsafe, if an adequate warning and instruction has been provided pursuant to G.S. 99B-5(c). As used in this subsection, “unavoidably unsafe” means that, in the state of technical, scientific, and medical knowledge generally prevailing at the time the product left the control of its manufacturer, an aspect of that product that caused the claimant’s harm was not reasonably capable of being made safe.
