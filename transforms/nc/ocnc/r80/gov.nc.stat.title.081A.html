                <p>
                    All public weighmasters shall issue certificates of weight, measure, count, reading or recording on forms approved by the Commissioner and shall enforce the provisions of this Chapter and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder without compensation
                    from the State. Each certificate issued shall indicate the date on which a product is weighed, counted, read or recorded. A certificate issued by a public weighmaster shall be considered the accurate weight of a product at the time
                    the product is put into the natural channels of trade, with the qualification that reasonable variations or tolerances shall be permitted as established by rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this Chapter. If any person questions
                    the accuracy of the weight of any product for which a certificate has been issued, a complaint shall be made to the public weighmaster who issued the certificate or to the Commissioner before the product is moved from the city, town
                    or community where the certificate was issued. The product shall be reweighed by the public weighmaster issuing the certificate or by the Commissioner, if the product is kept in accordance with G.S. 81A-58. If, upon reweighing, a difference
                    in excess of the tolerance allowed by the Chapter is found in the original weight, the cost of reweighing shall be borne by the public weighmaster responsible for issuing the faulty certificate. Otherwise, the cost shall be borne by
                    the complainant.

                    It shall be the duty of every public weighmaster to obtain from the Department an official seal for the sum of six dollars ($6.00), inscribed with the following words: “North Carolina Public Weighmaster” and any other design or legend the Commissioner
                    considers necessary. The seal shall be stamped or impressed on every certificate issued pursuant to this Article. The weighers of tobacco in leaf tobacco warehouses may use, instead of the seal, their signatures in ink or other indelible
                    substance posted in a conspicuous and accessible place in the warehouse. All seals remain the property of the State and shall be returned to the Commissioner upon termination of duties as a public weighmaster.
