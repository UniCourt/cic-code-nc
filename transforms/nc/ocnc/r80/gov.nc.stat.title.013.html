     Legislative Intent. —

   </p>
   <p>
    The 1971 General Assembly, in rewriting this Chapter, intended to substantially relax the requirements necessary for a convicted felon to have his citizenship restored. These requirements were further relaxed by the 1973 amendments to this Chapter. State v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 562</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 153, 1974 N.C. LEXIS 1287 (1974).

   <p>
    <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.251.html" target="_blank">Chapter 251</a></cite>, Session Laws of 1973, which revised this Chapter, must be given retroactive application in order to be constitutionally valid. State v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 198 S.E.2d 491, <cite class="nc_code">1973 N.C.

   <p>
    Though the 1973 revision of this section was enacted after a defendant was indicted for felonious possession of a firearm, it was applicable. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 202 S.E.2d 284, <cite class="nc_code">1974 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2512 (1974).

    Loss of citizenship does not form a part of the judgment
   
   of the court, but follows as a consequence of such judgment. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 685</cite>, 1880 N.C. LEXIS 332 (1880).

    <b>
     Restoration of rights of citizenship under subdivision (4) does not meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1203(2),
    </b>
    which exempts certain felons from the federal prohibition against possession of firearms, unless it expressly authorizes the possession of firearms. United States v. Hardin, 696 F.2d 1078, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 22950 (4th Cir. 1982).

     Proof of Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    In North Carolina, to support a conviction for possession of a firearm by an ex-felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the government must prove, at a minimum, that the defendant possessed a firearm within five years of release from supervision resulting from the prior North Carolina felony. Otherwise, he would as a matter of law stand in the same shoes as any other person who had not been previously convicted of a felony. United States v. Essick, 935 F.2d 28, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 8288 (4th Cir. 1991), limited, United States v. Thomas, 52 F.3d 82, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 9017 (4th Cir. 1995), limited, United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 33726 (1st Cir. 1995).
   </p>
   <p>
    Because defendant’s State felony conviction occurred within five years of a firearm offense, under North Carolina Felony Firearms Act (G.S. 14-415) the defendant’s civil rights could not have been fully restored, and the government proved a firearm possession violation despite the fact that it did not independently establish that defendant’s civil rights had not been restored at the time of his firearm possession. United States v. Thomas, 52 F.3d 82, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 9017 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 885, 116 S. Ct. 226, 133 L. Ed. 2d 155, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 6420 (1995).

    <b>
     Repeal of Exemption from Firearms Act. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    When the Firearms Act became law in 1971, felons were not automatically restored to full citizenship immediately on their release from prison; however, those felons whose citizenship rights had been restored were exempt from the Act. Then in 1973, North Carolina amended the General Statutes to restore felons to full citizenship immediately upon their unconditional discharge under this Chapter. When it became apparent that this would make virtually all felons exempt from the Firearms Act the General Assembly repealed the exemption (former G.S. 14-415.2) for felons whose citizenship rights had been restored. United States v. McLean, 904 F.2d 216, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 8885 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 875, 111 S. Ct. 203, 112 L. Ed. 2d 164, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 4613 (1990).

     Service As a Juror. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    On appeal from defendant’s convictions on charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm, the State Supreme Court refused to consider defendant’s argument that the trial court erred by dismissing a juror for cause after the juror informed the court that the juror was convicted in Texas of committing several felonies in the 1970s, because defendant did not raise the argument that the juror’s citizenship rights were restored by G.S. 13-1(5), when the trial court dismissed the juror for cause. State v. Haselden, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 1</cite>, 577 S.E.2d 594, 2003 N.C. LEXIS 318, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 988, 124 S. Ct. 475, 157 L. Ed. 2d 382, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 8097 (2003).

     An ex-felon found in possession of a firearm could be prosecuted
    </b>
    under the Felony Firearms Act, even though he may have lawfully possessed it prior to the December 1, 1995, amendment since his restoration of rights under this chapter, when read in conjunction with G.S. 14-415.1, expressly prohibits the possession of firearms regardless of the date of felony conviction; the General Assembly clearly intended G.S. 14-415.1’s application to be retroactive.
