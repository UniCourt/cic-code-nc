                <p>
                    It is the intent and purpose of this Chapter to establish for the government of the State a system of personnel administration under the Governor, based on accepted principles of personnel administration and applying the best methods as evolved in government
                    and industry. It is also the intent of this Chapter that this system of personnel administration shall apply to local employees paid entirely or in part from federal funds, except to the extent that local governing boards are authorized
                    by this Chapter to establish local rules, local pay plans, and local personnel systems. It is also the intent of this Chapter to make provisions for a decentralized system of personnel administration, where appropriate, and without
                    additional cost to the State, with the State Human Resources Commission as the policy and rule-making body. The Office of State Human Resources shall make recommendations for policies and rules to the Commission based on research and
                    study in the field of personnel management, develop and administer statewide standards and criteria for good personnel management, provide training and technical assistance to all agencies, departments, and institutions, provide oversight,
                    which includes conducting audits to monitor compliance with established State Human Resources Commission policies and rules, administer a system for implementing necessary corrective actions when the rule, standards, or criteria are
                    not met, and serve as the central repository for State Human Resources system data. The agency, department, and institution heads shall be responsible and accountable for execution of Commission policies and rules for their employees.

                        Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for just cause, the act exempts certain employees
                        by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position designated as policy-making or confidential
                        by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor Governor’s actions were proper if done
                        for political patronage reasons that require, as a qualification for the performance of a job, a political affiliation. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 17593 (4th Cir. 1990), dismissed, 783 F. Supp. 970, 1992

                        passed resolutions leaving the employees of the consolidated human services agency subject to the SHRA; therefore, just cause was required to support the technician’s termination. Watlington v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. Rockingham Cnty.,

                        Because retention of employees in abolished positions is clearly a personnel matter affecting the separation of employees, under subdivision (7a), the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] has authority to issue a policy thereon

                        When temporary state employees sued the State for employing the employees more than 12 months, contrary to N.C. Admin. Code 1C.0405(a), the employees’ breach of contract claim was properly dismissed because: (1) nothing showed the State induced the employees
                        to work more than 12 months, beyond paying normal wages, or said the employees would become permanent after 12 months, and (2) no authority required the State to convert the employees’ status to permanent. Sanders v. State Pers.

        The rationale for creating exempt positions,

                        Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for just cause, the act exempts certain employees
                        by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position designated as policy-making or confidential
                        by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor Governor’s actions were proper if done
                        for political patronage reasons that require, as a qualification for the performance of a job, a political affiliation. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 17593 (4th Cir. 1990), dismissed, 783 F. Supp. 970, 1992

                        Applicability of the just cause requirement set forth in G.S. 126-5(a)(2) is determined by the permanency of employment and not by months of service; therefore, a terminated employee who worked less than 24 months before being terminated while on medical
                        leave was entitled to file a contested case based on a lack of just cause since she had been an employee of the Department of Social Services, which was a local social services department. Early v. County of Durham Dep't of Soc.

                        The legislative intent, as to the meaning of the term “department head” in subsection (e), is the official who has executive and managerial authority over the department in which an exempt policymaking position is designated, including cabinet department

                        Because the chairman of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) had the authority to staff and make personnel decisions in the ESC, she had the authority as a “department head”, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, to dismiss plaintiff from his
                        exempt policymaking position within the ESC. Carrington v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 525 S.E.2d 230, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 104 (2000).

                        The term “priority” in the language of subsection (e), providing that “such employee shall have priority to any position that becomes available for which the employee is qualified”, gives an affected employee the right to an automatic offer of a position

                        In subsection (e), the phrase “such employee shall have priority to any position that becomes available for which the employee is qualified” means that if the employee is qualified for a job in state government which is available, he must be offered this

                        the investigatorial assistant’s at will employment, the district attorney’s decision to terminate him rested within his lawful and discretionary scope of authority; because the investigatorial assistant’s termination was not injurious

                        The salary schedules established by the Department of Human Resources and the Department of Correction for educational personnel exempt from the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] must correspond to the salary schedules established
                        by the State Board of Education for public school employees except in cases where the duties of employees do not correspond to the duties of public school employee positions. In such cases the salary schedule should conform as
                        closely as possible to the public school salary schedules. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Phillip J. Kirk, Jr., Secretary, Department of Human Resources, 57 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 13 (1987).

                        Once an individual is entitled to priority employment rights within the State Personnel System, only specific statutory language will be sufficient to eliminate any agency from making a vacancy available to the individual. See opinion of Attorney General

                        the person must be offered that position. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Brent Lane, Executive Director, N.C. Technological Development Authority, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 31 (1989).

                        the State Personnel System. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Brent Lane, Executive Director, N.C. Technological Development Authority, 59 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 31 (1989).

                        order to further the agenda of the administration. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 17593 (4th Cir. 1990), dismissed, 783 F. Supp. 970, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2035 (D.N.C. 1992).

                        Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for just cause, the act exempts certain employees
                        by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position designated as policy-making or confidential
                        by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor Governor’s actions were proper if done
                        for political patronage reasons that require, as a qualification for the performance of a job, a political affiliation. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 17593 (4th Cir. 1990), dismissed, 783 F. Supp. 970, 1992

                        to the public or against the public good, there was no evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact to support a claim for wrongful discharge against the district attorney. Hines v. Yates,

                    Session Laws 2003-169, s. 7, provides: “In the event that federal regulatory or statutory provisions providing compensation and benefits to persons for infection with smallpox, infection with vaccinia, or any adverse medical reaction incident to the Administration
                    of Smallpox Countermeasures by Health Professionals, section 304 of the Homeland Security Act, Pub. L. No. 107-296 (Nov. 25, 2002) (to be codified at 42 U.S.C. § 233(p)) are adopted, a condition precedent to recovery under this act
                    shall be that the person claiming compensation and benefits under this act shall first seek compensation and benefits under the federal provisions, with those provisions constituting primary coverage and the person then being entitled
                    to compensation and benefits under this act not exceeding a total recovery under the federal provisions and this act equal to the amount available under the applicable provisions of this act.” The Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection

    Discontinued service retirement allowance and severance wages for certain State employees.

                        When the Director of the Budget determines that the closing of a State institution or a reduction in force will accomplish economies in the State Budget, the Director of the Budget shall pay either a discontinued service retirement allowance or severance
                        wages to any affected State employee, provided reemployment is not available. As used in this section, “economies in the State Budget” means economies resulting from elimination of a job and its responsibilities or from a lack
                        of funds to support the job. In determining whether to pay a discontinued service retirement allowance or severance wages, the Director of the Budget shall consider the recommendation of the department head involved and any recommendation
                        of the Director of the Office of State Human Resources. Severance wages shall not be paid to an employee who chooses a discontinued service retirement. Severance wages shall not be subject to employer or employee retirement contributions.
                        Severance wages shall be paid according to the policies adopted by the State Human Resources Commission.Notwithstanding any other provisions of the State’s retirement laws, any employee of the State who is a member of the Teachers’
                        and State Employees’ Retirement System or the Law-Enforcement Officers’ Retirement System and whose job is involuntarily terminated as a result of economies in the State Budget may be entitled to a discontinued service retirement
                        allowance, subject to the approval of the employing agency and the availability of agency funds. An unreduced discontinued service retirement allowance, not otherwise allowed, may be approved for employees with 20 or more years
                        of creditable retirement service who are at least 55 years of age; or a discontinued service retirement allowance, not otherwise allowed, may be approved for employees with 20 or more years of creditable retirement service who
                        are at least 50 years of age, reduced by one-fourth of one percent (1/4 of 1%) for each month that retirement precedes the employee’s fifty-fifth birthday. In cases where a discontinued service retirement allowance is approved,
                        the employing agency shall make a lump sum payment to the Administrator of the State Retirement Systems equal to the actuarial present value of the additional liabilities imposed upon the System, to be determined by the System’s
                        consulting actuary, as a result of the discontinued service retirement, plus an administrative fee to be determined by the Administrator, plus an amount to be deposited in the Retiree Health Benefit Fund. The amount to be deposited
                        in the Retiree Health Benefit Fund shall be calculated by multiplying the number of years between the employee’s date of discontinued service retirement and the employee’s earliest unreduced retirement date under G.S. 135-5 by
                        the most recent employer contribution rate to the Retiree Health Benefit Fund and then, if the employee is or would be eligible for retiree medical coverage under the State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees, multiplying
                        that figure by the salary used in the discontinued salary retirement calculation.The salary used to determine severance wages under this section is the last annual salary except that if the employee was promoted within the previous
                        12 months, the last annual salary is that annual salary prior to the promotion. If the annual salary prior to the promotion is used, it shall be adjusted to account for any across-the-board legislative salary increases. Excluded
                        from any calculation are any benefits such as, but not limited to, overtime pay, shift pay, holiday premium, or longevity pay. The salary used to determine the discontinued retirement allowance under this section is the same as
                        the average final compensation under G.S. 135-1(5).

                    The State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission], in accordance with G.S. 126-14.3, has adopted rules designed to encourage open and fair competition for positions in State government. However, as detailed in the Review of Reserve
                    Funds in the 2004-2005 Revised Certified Budget, there was an appearance of impropriety that reflected a process that was neither open nor fair. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Leslie Merritt, Auditor, 2005 N.C. Op.

                        North Carolina Supreme Court has adopted the United States Supreme Court’s “burden shifting” scheme set out in the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); therefore, North Carolina courts look to federal decisions for
                        guidance in establishing evidentiary standards and principles of law to be applied in discrimination cases. In properly applying the burden-shifting scheme the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant
                        intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744,

                        Some of the factors that courts have considered as relevant evidence of pretext are: (1) evidence that white employees involved in acts against the employer of comparable seriousness were retained or rehired; (2) evidence of the employer’s treatment of
                        the employee during his term of employment; (3) evidence of the employer’s response to the employee’s legitimate civil rights activities; and (4) evidence of the employer’s general policy and practice with respect to minority employees.

                    <p>
                        Burden to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination giving rise to a presumption of discrimination is as follows: (1) plaintiff is a member of a minority group; (2) she was qualified for a promotion; (3) she was passed over for the promotion;
                        and (4) the person receiving the promotion was not a member of a protected class. To rebut the presumption of discrimination, the employer must clearly explain by admissible evidence the nondiscriminatory reasons for the employee’s
                        rejection or discharge; the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered explanation by the State is pretextual in nature, and that the employer intentionally discriminated. Enoch v. Alamance County

                        During an attempt to show that an employer’s proffered explanation of a nondiscriminatory reason for an employee’s rejection or discharge is pretextual, the plaintiff can reuse evidence from her prima facie showing to assist in carrying her burden as
                        to pretext though the prima facie presumption has been dispelled. However, the court is not at liberty to review the soundness or reasonableness of an employer’s business judgment when it considers whether alleged disparate treatment
                        is a pretext for discrimination: the sole question is what is the motivation behind the employer’s decision. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233,

                <p>
                    A “Referral Incentive Award” program would not violate this section because it did not allow the referring state employee to receive any sort of compensation from any other source related to the referral and the program did not have any provision in it
                    that would require or allow the State to pay any kind of fee that might be charged by a licensed referral source to the jobhunter. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Ronald G. Penny, State Personnel Director, 2000 N.C. AG LEXIS
                    10 (6/30/2000).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section does not prohibit the State or one of its agencies from utilizing the services of a personnel agency or search firm to find candidates for a difficult-to-recruit position after other efforts to fill the position have failed; however, the
                    statutorily mandated promotional priority for state employees under this section restricts and limits the ability of state agencies to act in this situation. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Richard V. Lee, State Personnel Director,
                    58 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 91 (1988).

                    Session Laws 2016-108, s. 2(a) provides: “The February 5, 2008, Attorney General’s advisory opinion entitled ‘Advisory Opinion: Confidentiality of Retirement Benefit Information; Session Law 2007-508’ concluded that information about retirement benefits
                    was intended to be included among those records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission, and bureau of the State and that as a result the Retirement Systems Division of the
                    Department of the State Treasurer makes that information available for public inspection and examination. The General Assembly finds that the interests of clarity require statutory language providing guidance to the Retirement Systems
                    Division in determining and maintaining consistency as to what information should be made available about the retirement accounts of State and local employees.”

                    was intended to be included among those records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission, and bureau of the State and that as a result the Retirement Systems Division of the
                    Department of the State Treasurer makes that information available for public inspection and examination. The General Assembly finds that the interests of clarity require statutory language providing guidance to the Retirement Systems
                    Division in determining and maintaining consistency as to what information should be made available about the retirement accounts of State and local employees.”

                    <p>
                        Even if a tenured public university professor’s libel claim was brought against a department head in his individual capacity, the libel claim, which was based on the department head’s annual review of the professor, failed because the department head
                        was required to write and maintain a public record of the professor’s official status at the university, G.S. 126-23, the dean of the college had the right to review the full contents of the record, G.S. 126-24(2), and when state
                        employees had statutory rights and obligations regarding the maintenance of employee records, communication in conformity with those rights and obligations did not constitute publication for a libel suit. White v. Trew,

                        Contracts under which institutions employ coaches and contracts between the institutions and certain vendors or suppliers which involve or concern those coaches or other documents related to those contracts are public records. See opinion of Attorney

                        In enacting Session Law 2007-508 the General Assembly did not intend to exclude retirement benefit information from the records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission and bureau of the state
                        in accordance with G.S. 126-23. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Tony Rand, North Carolina Senate and The Honorable David W. Hoyle, North Carolina Senate, (11/7/06).

                        General Assembly, in enacting Session Law 2007-508, did not intend to exclude retirement benefit information from the records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission and bureau of the state in
                        accordance with G.S. 126-23. Such information, upon request, should be made available for inspection and copying. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Tony Rand and Honorable David W. Hoyle, Senate, 2008 N.C. Op. Att'y

                        “Current benefits” includes the amount of accumulated leave time that a university employee has available for use at the time the inspection is requested. As such, G.S. 126-23 requires the university system to provide the accumulated leave time for employees.
                        See opinion of Attorney General to Laura B. Luger, Vice President and General Counsel, The University of North Carolina, 2009 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 1 (06/15/09).

                    <p>
                        Leave time is a benefit required to be kept open for public inspection in accordance with G.S. 126-23. Sick leave balances, vacation leave balances, bonus leave balances, and compensatory time accrued are therefore current benefits to university employees
                        which should be made available for inspection and copying upon request. See opinion of Attorney General to Laura B. Luger, Vice President and General Counsel, The University of North Carolina, 2009 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 1 (06/15/09).

                        Public employers are now required to maintain a public record of the entire salary and position classification history of each employee to the extent the employer has possession of such information. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman,

                        The Act, 2010 N.C. Sess. Laws c. 169, requires public employers to maintain for public inspection a copy of the final decision of the public body setting forth the specific acts or omissions for termination of each employee dismissed for disciplinary
                        reasons. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman, State Personnel Director, 2010 N.C.G.A. 3 (11/08/10).

                        of October 1, 2010, however, is now required to be maintained in a record that is open for public inspection. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman, State Personnel Director, 2010 N.C.G.A. 3 (11/08/10).

                    Session Laws 2011-324, s. 1.1(a), provides: “The General Assembly finds that allowing inmates, probationers, parolees, and post-release supervisees to access public employees’ personnel files that are public records under State law exposes those public
                    employees to the risk of harassment and even violence. The General Assembly further finds that such offenders, due to their status as inmates, probationers, parolees, and post-release supervisees, are not entitled to the same privileges
                    and rights exercised by members of the general public and should be prohibited from accessing public employees’ personnel files in the interest of protecting those public employees from harm.”

                    was intended to be included among those records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission, and bureau of the State and that as a result the Retirement Systems Division of the
                    Department of the State Treasurer makes that information available for public inspection and examination. The General Assembly finds that the interests of clarity require statutory language providing guidance to the Retirement Systems
                    Division in determining and maintaining consistency as to what information should be made available about the retirement accounts of State and local employees.”

                    <p>
                        Even if a tenured public university professor’s libel claim was brought against a department head in his individual capacity, the libel claim, which was based on the department head’s annual review of the professor, failed because the department head
                        was required to write and maintain a public record of the professor’s official status at the university, G.S. 126-23, the dean of the college had the right to review the full contents of the record, G.S. 126-24(2), and when state
                        employees had statutory rights and obligations regarding the maintenance of employee records, communication in conformity with those rights and obligations did not constitute publication for a libel suit. White v. Trew,

                        Contracts under which institutions employ coaches and contracts between the institutions and certain vendors or suppliers which involve or concern those coaches or other documents related to those contracts are public records. See opinion of Attorney
                        General to Charles J. Waldrup, Associate Vice President for Legal Affairs, University of North Carolina, 2003 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 2 (2/6/03).

                        In enacting Session Law 2007-508 the General Assembly did not intend to exclude retirement benefit information from the records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission and bureau of the state
                        in accordance with G.S. 126-23. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Tony Rand, North Carolina Senate and The Honorable David W. Hoyle, North Carolina Senate, (11/7/06).

                        General Assembly, in enacting Session Law 2007-508, did not intend to exclude retirement benefit information from the records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission and bureau of the state in
                        accordance with G.S. 126-23. Such information, upon request, should be made available for inspection and copying. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Tony Rand and Honorable David W. Hoyle, Senate, 2008 N.C. Op. Att'y

                        “Current benefits” includes the amount of accumulated leave time that a university employee has available for use at the time the inspection is requested. As such, G.S. 126-23 requires the university system to provide the accumulated leave time for employees.
                        See opinion of Attorney General to Laura B. Luger, Vice President and General Counsel, The University of North Carolina, 2009 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 1 (06/15/09).

                    <p>
                        Leave time is a benefit required to be kept open for public inspection in accordance with G.S. 126-23. Sick leave balances, vacation leave balances, bonus leave balances, and compensatory time accrued are therefore current benefits to university employees
                        which should be made available for inspection and copying upon request. See opinion of Attorney General to Laura B. Luger, Vice President and General Counsel, The University of North Carolina, 2009 N.C. Op. Att'y Gen. 1 (06/15/09).

                        Public employers are now required to maintain a public record of the entire salary and position classification history of each employee to the extent the employer has possession of such information. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman,

                        The Act, 2010 N.C. Sess. Laws c. 169, requires public employers to maintain for public inspection a copy of the final decision of the public body setting forth the specific acts or omissions for termination of each employee dismissed for disciplinary
                        reasons. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman, State Personnel Director, 2010 N.C.G.A. 3 (11/08/10).

                        of October 1, 2010, however, is now required to be maintained in a record that is open for public inspection. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Linda Coleman, State Personnel Director, 2010 N.C.G.A. 3 (11/08/10).

                        Even if a tenured public university professor’s libel claim was brought against a department head in his individual capacity, the libel claim, which was based on the department head’s annual review of the professor, failed because the department head
                        was required to write and maintain a public record of the professor’s official status at the university, G.S. 126-23, the dean of the college had the right to review the full contents of the record, G.S. 126-24(2), and when state
                        employees had statutory rights and obligations regarding the maintenance of employee records, communication in conformity with those rights and obligations did not constitute publication for a libel suit. White v. Trew,

                        Challenge of the North Carolina Department of Transportation to the trial court’s order that it failed to produce sufficient evidence of a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for discipline was nothing more than a challenge to the factual determinations

                        Administrative law judge properly applied the after-acquired-evidence doctrine to a terminated career state employee and barred the employee from reinstatement and additional compensation because, although a state university wrongfully terminated the
                        employee for theft, the university would have terminated the employee immediately upon subsequently learning of the employee’s failure to report criminal convictions on a job application. The employee’s remedy was limited to back
                        pay from the time of the discharge to the discovery of the evidence. Brown v. Fayetteville State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 837 S.E.2d 390, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 4 (2020).

                        The State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides for administrative-type grievance procedures for violations of its provisions. The statute further provides that judicial review of unfavorable decisions may be had in superior
                        court. Where a statute provides for an orderly procedure for an appeal to the superior court for review, this procedure is the exclusive means for obtaining judicial review, and a civil action is only proper after all administrative

                        Employee’s memorandum, coupled with the prior history existing between the employee and the North Carolina Department of Transportation, sufficed to place the Department on notice that the employee was complaining of either harassment or retaliation,
                        or both, based on his race because the employee’s communication asserted that the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] had ruled that the Department’s predecessor had retaliated against him, that the
                        Department had to treat him with the same respect it showed to senior white officers, and that the employee did not believe that the deputy director circumvented the white senior officers when personnel matters were being handled.

                        When a state employee sought review of the termination of her employment, G.S. 126-34.1(a)(2)(b) (now repealed) did not give her a right to a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings, because her job as “instructional and research staff of

                        Language of G.S. 126-34.1 (now repealed) of the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] clearly and unambiguously stated that the statutory list of appeal grounds in former G.S. 126-34.1 was exclusive, and this list did not provide
                        for appeals to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) of reductions in force (RIF) based on a lack of just cause; the North Carolina General Assembly clearly intended to deny the OAH jurisdiction over challenges to RIF on
                        procedural violation grounds and to grant state employees the right to bring only those RIF claims that were specifically set out in G.S. 126-34.1 before OAH. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel Hill v. Feinstein,

                        Applicability of the just cause requirement set forth in G.S. 126-5(a)(2) is determined by the permanency of employment and not by months of service; therefore, a terminated employee who worked less than 24 months before being terminated while on medical

                        This section does not contain a definition of “promotion.” Unless a word in a statute has acquired a technical meaning or the language of the statute indicates that a special use is intended, it must be given its “common and ordinary meaning.” Edwards

                        The word “promotion” is not peculiar to any particular profession, but is universally used. Nothing in the text of this section indicates that the legislature sought to attach any technical meaning to its use. Edwards v. University of N.C.

                        The important criteria in both the dictionary and State Personnel Commission definitions of “promotion” are greater status and a higher standing in relation to others. Accordingly, to the extent any individual’s relative standing among his peers was raised
                        when the university police department reclassified ranks, that individual was promoted. Edwards v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C.

                        There is no mention in the definition of promotion of increased pay or change in job classification. This definition is consistent with other states’ interpretations of promotion, which recognize that salary increases and changes in job classification

                        When employee alleges that employer treated him or her in particular less favorably than other employees, employee raises claim of “disparate treatment.” North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        602, 394 S.E.2d 285, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 809 (1990).

                        According to “disparate treatment” analysis, employee has initial burden of proving, by preponderance of evidence, prima facie case of discrimination. [1] He applied for and was qualified for an available position, [2] that he was rejected, and that [3]
                        after he was rejected employer filled position with white employee. Once employee establishes prima facie case, inference of discrimination arises. To rebut this inference, the employer must present evidence that employee was rejected,
                        or other applicant was chosen, for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Employee retains final burden of persuading jury of intentional discrimination.

                        From whole record, substantial evidence supports commission’s conclusion that employer’s stated reasons were legitimate and not pretext for discrimination. Conversely, there is lacking substantial evidence that retaliation for past opposition to discrimination
                        was “predominant reason.” Gadson v. North Carolina Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 392 S.E.2d 618, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 476 (1990).

                        Employee may use various forms of evidence to demonstrate that state’s proffered reason was not its true reason. An employee might seek to demonstrate that employer’s claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that he
                        was in fact better qualified than person chosen for position. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 809 (1990).

                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) could award a state employee appellate attorneys’ fees in an employment case because (1) OAH’s authority was not statutorily limited to the administrative part of a contested case, (2) such a limit would not be
                        read into the statute, and (3) the statute expanded OAH’s authority to award fees by authorizing remedies where an employee prevailed on appeal of a whistleblower grievance. Hunt v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety,

                        When the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) awarded a state employee appellate attorneys’ fees in an employment case, it was not appropriate to apply the “Johnson factors” adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine
                        the reasonableness of the fees because this framework had not been adopted in North Carolina. Hunt v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 830 S.E.2d 865, <cite class="nc_code">2019 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 547 (2019).

                        Court of appeals erred in invalidating an administrative law judge’s decision to award back pay and attorneys’ fees to a county department of social services employee because the judge had express statutory authority to award back pay and attorneys’ fees
                        to the employee; the absence of any reference to an attorneys’ fee award in G.S. 150B-33(b)(11) had no bearing upon the proper resolution of the issue of whether the judge had the authority to award attorneys’ fees to the employee.
                        Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 409</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 390, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 93 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Given that a county department of social services employee was a protected employee for purposes of the North Carolina Human Resources Act, the fact that an administrative law judge was explicitly authorized to award backpay to a wrongfully discharged
                        state or local government employee conclusively resolved the issue of whether the administrative law judge had the authority to require that the employee receive backpay. Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,

                    <p>
                        Fact that G.S. 150B-33(b)(11) makes no reference to the making of an attorneys’ fee award to a wrongfully discharged local government employee has no bearing upon the issue of whether such an award is authorized for unlawfully discharged local government
                        employees by the North Carolina Human Resources Act, G.S. 126-34.02(e). Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 409</cite>, 838 S.E.2d 390, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 93 (2020).

                        Career state employee was properly terminated from the employee’s position at a state university hospital for just cause because the employer’s code of conduct consisted of written work rules authorized by statute and the employee’s disruptive behavior

                        and was a willful violation of highway patrol policies, but termination was inconsistent with the state highway patrol’s treatment of similar conduct. Moreover, the sergeant’s excellent work history, tenure of service, and the

                        Although there was no bright line test to determine whether a ranger’s conduct established unacceptable personal conduct, and thus “just cause” for a decision by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to demote him and reduce

                        cause for such a severe penalty as demotion; the ranger’s conduct did not justifiably fall under the State Personnel Commission’s [now State Human Resources Commission’s] regulatory definition of “unacceptable personal conduct,”

                        While an expert testified that a highway patrol officer’s use of alcohol was a factor in his behavior, which included firing his firearm into the floor and ingesting sleeping pills, the expert also testified that the officer’s behavior was caused by a
                        combination of alcohol, the officer’s first dose of lithium, “hypomania,” and his being “relatively unmedicated for his bipolar disorder;” accordingly, the challenged finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence. Neither
                        could the court conclude that the application of the rational nexus test resulted in prejudice to the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety; thus, the Department did not have just cause to dismiss the officer. Bulloch v.

                        to show just cause, and (2) substantial evidence supported the ALJ’s factual findings that the employee’s unacceptable personal conduct did not warrant the sanction of dismissal, making those findings binding on appeal, as the

                        grounds that his supervisor’s directives were not carried out to their fullest extent. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350,

                        Where State employees were putting in extra effort to attempt to meet supervisor’s requirements, which failed to take into account many realities of school caseload, and where there was nothing in the record which would indicate that the inability of
                        the employees to meet the supervisor’s goals adversely affected the agency in any way, and where findings indicated that the employer’s clients were well served by each employee, the trial court correctly concluded that the Commission’s
                        own findings did not support its conclusion that just cause was established. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C.

                        Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for just cause, the act exempts certain employees
                        by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position designated as policy-making or confidential
                        by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor Governor’s actions were proper if done

                        leader even though the workers preferred not to work in a crew, and that respondent violated agency procedure by not reporting illegal aliens, since the letter did not describe any incidents with sufficient particularity so that
                        respondent could know precisely what acts or omissions were the basis of his discharge. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 274 S.E.2d 256, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2115 (1981).

                        Although the Department of Human Resources’ original notice to petitioner clearly stated the specific acts underlying its decision to take a particular disciplinary action, i.e., dismissal, the secretary’s subsequent notice that her decision to demote
                        petitioner was “based upon the information presented” was not an adequate statement of the specific acts or omissions underlying her decision to take a different disciplinary action, i.e., demotion. Meyers v. Department of Human

                        Trial court did not err in affirming the State Personnel Commission’s [now State Human Resources Commission’s] decision to grant a former employer summary judgment because a former employee was dismissed for violating one of the employer’s rules and for

                        North Carolina State Highway Patrol did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it dismissed a state trooper because just cause existed, pursuant to G.S. 126-35, to support the trooper’s termination from the Highway Patrol because the trooper engaged
                        in unacceptable personal conduct by having an extramarital affair over a period of years and engaging in sexual conduct during the affair in a patrol car, behind a patrol car, and in a Highway Patrol office while in uniform. Furthermore,

                        Office of Administrative Hearings erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a career state employee because the employer met the procedural statutory requirements prior to dismissing the employee, the employee was not deprived of her ability to prepare
                        an effective representation or effectively appeal her discharge, and did not meet her burden of showing that her dismissal was based on discrimination inasmuch as she was placed on a performance improvement plan, participated in
                        ongoing progress meetings where she received feedback, guidance, and counseling, received two detailed warnings, a pre-dismissal letter, and a dismissal letter, all of which described in sufficient detail the employee’s unsatisfactory

                        In a case where the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (DPI) dismissed a career State employee, the final decision of the administrative law judge upholding the employee’s dismissal for just cause was affirmed because the employee engaged
                        in conduct unbecoming of a State employee that was detrimental to State service by becoming involved in a loud confrontation with a female colleague, which resulted in her believing that the employee had harassed her and had created
                        a hostile work environment for female employees; he engaged in inappropriate conduct during a potential employee’s interview; and the employee displayed a pattern of petulant, inappropriate, and insubordinate behavior that extended
                        over the course of several years. Smith v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Instruction, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 430, 820 S.E.2d 561, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 923 (2018).

                        Substantial evidence supported the ALJ’s findings that the employee engaged in unacceptable personal conduct and grossly ineffective job performance, and therefore her termination was upheld, because she was driving a bus with a coworker and a student
                        on board at a high rate of speed, between 80 and 85 miles per hour. The employee’s own admissions showed that it was a requirement of her job and a known work rule that she was not to drive the school’s bus at a speed greater than
                        55 miles per hour. Sharpe-Johnson v. NC Dep't of Pub. Instruction E. N.C. Sch. for the Deaf, 867 S.E.2d 188, 2021- NCCOA-562, <cite class="nc_code">2021 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 582 (Ct. App. 2021).

                        When an employee alleged the employee was terminated in violation of North Carolina’s Whistleblower Act, a trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to administrative proceedings below because the claim was dismissed at the administrative

                        Even if it were assumed arguendo that a former employee established a prima facie claim of retaliation, the employee’s suit against corrections officials was properly disposed through summary judgment because the officials articulated some legitimate,

                        Claims brought under the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through 126-88, should be adjudicated according to the following procedures: (1) the plaintiff must endeavor to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the statute, the plaintiff
                        should include any available direct evidence that the adverse employment action was retaliatory along with circumstantial evidence to that effect; (2) the defendant should present its case, including its evidence as to legitimate
                        reasons for the employment decision; and (3) once all the evidence has been received, the court should determine whether the McDonnell Douglas or Price Waterhouse framework properly applies to the evidence before it. If the plaintiff
                        has demonstrated that he or she engaged in a protected activity and the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff in his or her employment, and if the plaintiff has further established by direct evidence that the protected
                        conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action, then the defendant bears the burden to show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision; if, however,
                        the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Price Waterhouse threshold, the case should be decided under the principles enunciated in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, with the plaintiff bearing the burden of persuasion on the ultimate
                        issue whether the employment action was taken for retaliatory purposes. Newberne v. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 782</cite>, 618 S.E.2d 201, 2005 N.C. LEXIS 835

                        Agreement settling a former employee’s administrative action against an agency did not estop the former employee from seeking damages under the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq., because the former employee did not allege a Whistleblower Act claim
                        in the administrative action and such remedies were not recoverable in the administrative action; the settlement agreement did not contain any release of a claim under the Whistleblower Act. The former employee’s acceptance of
                        the settlement agreement and subsequent voluntary resignation did not negate the fact that the former employee’s employment was terminated. Newberne v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety,

                        State trooper’s claim for wrongful termination in violation of the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through 126-88, was wrongfully dismissed for failure to state a cause of action because the trooper, who alleged that the actual reason for
                        his termination was his disclosure of a possible abuse of authority in an amended statement that corrected a possibly misleading statement, stated a claim for relief under G.S. 126-84(a). Newberne v. Dep't of Crime Control &amp;

                        Doctor’s claim of being fired from a correctional institution in retaliation for reporting discrimination based on race or national origin was without merit because, based on statements by the doctor, it was clear that the doctor did not believe that

                        Superior court erred when it awarded a terminated state employee interest on a backpay award, which was entered after a jury rendered a verdict for the employee on his retaliation claim under G.S. 126-85(a) because pursuant to 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.0425,
                        North Carolina could not be required to pay interest on any backpay award. Brookshire v. N.C. DOT, DMV, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 637 S.E.2d 902, <cite class="nc_code">2006 N.C. App.</cite>                        LEXIS 2513 (2006).

                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) could award a state employee appellate attorneys’ fees in an employment case because (1) OAH’s authority was not statutorily limited to the administrative part of a contested case, (2) such a limit would not be
