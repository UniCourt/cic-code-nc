    Priority consideration for loan or grant from Wastewater Reserve or Drinking Water Reserve.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The considerations for priority in this section apply to a loan or grant from the Wastewater Reserve or the Drinking Water Reserve. The Division of Water Infrastructure must consider the following items when evaluating applications:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol11">
       Public necessity. —  A project that promotes public health and protects the environment, improves a system that is not in compliance with permit requirements or is under orders from the Department, enables a moratorium to be lifted, or replaces failing septic tanks with a wastewater collection system.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol12">
       Effect on impaired waters. —  A project that improves designated impaired waters of the State, with greater priority given to projects that improve designated impaired waters of the State that serve as a public water supply for a large public water system. For purposes of this subdivision, a large public water system is one serving more than 175,000 service connections.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13">
       Efficiency. —  A project that achieves efficiencies in meeting the State’s water infrastructure needs or reduces vulnerability to drought consistent with Part 2A of Article 21 and Article 38 of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes by one of the following methods:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13a">
         The combination of two or more wastewater or public water systems into a regional wastewater or public water system by merger, consolidation, or another means.
        </li>
        <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13b">
         Conservation or reuse of water, including bulk water reuse facilities and waterlines to supply reuse water for irrigation and other approved uses.
        </li>
        <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13c">
         Construction of an interconnection between water systems intended for use in drought or other water shortage emergency.
        </li>
        <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13d">
         Repair or replacement of leaking waterlines to improve water conservation and efficiency or to prevent contamination.
        </li>
        <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol13e">
         Replacement of meters and installation of new metering systems.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol14">
       Comprehensive land-use plan. —  A project that is located in a city or county that has adopted or has taken significant steps to adopt a comprehensive land-use plan under Article 18 of Chapter 153A of the General Statutes or Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes. The existence of a plan has more priority than steps taken to adopt a plan, such as adoption of a zoning ordinance. A plan that exceeds the minimum State standards for protection of water resources has higher priority than one that does not. A project is considered to be located in a city or county if it is located in whole or in part in that unit. A land-use plan is not considered a comprehensive land-use plan unless it has provisions that protect existing water uses and ensure compliance with water quality standards and classifications in all waters of the State affected by the plan.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Ga01s159G-23ol15">
       Flood hazard ordinance. —  A project that is located in a city or county that has adopted a flood hazard prevention ordinance under G.S. 143-215.54A. A plan that exceeds the minimum standards under G.S. 143-215.54A for a flood hazard prevention ordinance has higher priority than one that does not. A project is considered to be located in a city or county if it is located in whole or in part in that unit.

      “(c) Funds for the purposes described in subsection (b) of this section may not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) in each fiscal year. An application for a grant under this section for an emergency grant for operating deficits must be filed by the Local Government Commission on behalf of the local government unit. Applications for emergency grants for operating deficits are not subject to G.S. 159G-37(b).” Session Laws 2019-241, s. 11(i), provides that this 2019-241, s. 11(b), (c), expires on the earlier of (i) the date that House Bill 966, 2019 Regular Session, becomes law or (ii) June 30, 2020.
