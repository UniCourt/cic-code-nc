    Session Laws 2017-57, s. 26.3(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2018-5, s. 26.1(a), and as amended by Session Laws 2021-180, s. 37.5(b), provides: “(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that a nationally recognized cost-benefit analysis model will allow the General Assembly to direct public resources to cost-effective programs that deliver the best outcomes for residents. The Office of State Budget and Management shall receive periodic updates that incorporate new research and enhancements identified through work in participating states and practical technical assistance to implement this cutting-edge approach for identifying policy and budget options. The General Assembly also intends to provide necessary assistance for State agencies to align their individual efforts and resources to achieve statewide priority outcomes.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(b) The Office of State Budget and Management may consult and work with staff from the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative to implement a cost-benefit analysis model for use in crafting policy and budget decisions. The goal of the project is to obtain a model that will help the State invest in policies and programs that can be shown to work.
   </p>
   <p>
    “State agencies shall provide any information requested by the Office of State Budget and management for purposes of implementing this project. Local government and non-State entities that receive State funds may also be required to provide information to their funding agency or to the Office of State Budget and Management for purposes of implementing this project.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(c) Repealed by Session Laws 2021-180, s. 37.5(b), effective November 18, 2021, and applicable to reports submitted on or after that date.
   </p>
   <p>
    “(d) By October 1, 2018, the Office of State Budget and Management, in consultation with Results First partner agencies and the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative, shall develop and publish descriptive, formal definitions for tiered-levels of evidence. Each definition shall outline the criteria needed to qualify for each tier of evidence. The Office of State Budget and Management shall also identify which program or service areas will be expected to include evidence and research to support budget proposals. The definitions may be periodically updated as needed. The definitions, and any subsequent updates, shall be included in the annual report required by subsection (c) of this section.”
