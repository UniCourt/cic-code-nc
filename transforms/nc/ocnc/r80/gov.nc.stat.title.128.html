                            Offices whose duties are congruous may be consolidated; but it is just, in cases of consolidation of offices, to postpone the operation of the law until a vacancy appears in the office whose duties are to be transferred. Troy v. Wooten,

                            The legislature may reduce or increase the salaries of such officers as are not protected by the Constitution during their term of office, but cannot deprive them of the whole. Cotten v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 545</cite>,
                            1860 N.C. LEXIS 107 (1860).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless the Constitution otherwise expressly provides, the legislature has power to increase or vary the duties, or diminish the salary or other compensation appurtenant to the office, or abolish any of its rights or privileges before the end of the term,
                            or to alter or abridge the term, or to abolish the office itself. State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 425</cite>, 28 S.E. 554, 1897 N.C. LEXIS 255 (1897), writ of error
                            dismissed, 169 U.S. 586, 18 S. Ct. 435, 42 L. Ed. 865, 1898 U.S. LEXIS 1509 (1898); Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961, 1903 N.C. LEXIS 211 (1903).

                        <p>
                            The legislature may attach additional duties to an existing office, and it may afterwards lop off those duties and assign them to a new office, leaving the original office as it was before the additional duties were attached to it. State ex rel. Dowtin
                            v. Beardsley, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 119</cite>, 35 S.E. 241, 1900 N.C. LEXIS 199 (1900).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In respect to offices created and provided for by the Constitution, the people in convention assembled alone can alter, change their tenure, duties or emoluments, or abolish them; while in respect to legislative offices, it is entirely within the power
                            of the legislature to deal with them as public policy may suggest and public interest may demand. Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961, 1903 N.C. LEXIS 211 (1903).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although an office is a constitutional one, the legislature may, within reasonable limits, change the statutory duties and diminish the emoluments of such office, if the public welfare requires it. Fortune v. Buncombe County Comm'rs,

                            The word “office” in its primary signification implies a duty or duties — the agency from the State to perform the duties. The duties of the office are of first consequence, and the agency from the State to perform those duties is the next step in the
                            creation of an office. It is the union of the two factors, duty and agency, which makes the office. State Prison v. Day, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 362</cite>, 32 S.E. 748, 1899 N.C. LEXIS 68

                            The most important characteristic which distinguishes an office from a public agency is that the conferring of the office carries with it a delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions of the government. In this respect the terms “office”
                            and “place of trust” as used in our Constitution are synonymous. Doyle v. Aldermen of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 133</cite>, 1883 N.C. LEXIS 197 (1883); State ex rel. Barnhill v. Thompson,

                        While a trial judge presented with an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon any such petition, it should (1) summarily deny an application seeking the issuance of a writ
                        of habeas corpus that alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government and (2) deny a petitioner’s
                        request for discharge in the event that the return filed by a sheriff who has entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government claims that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant
                        or detainer. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 500 (2020).

                        Ordering two habeas petitioners’ release was error where they were held due to an immigration-related process by a sheriff who was a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Thus, the court’s state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness
                        of petitioners’ detentions had been superseded by federal law. Although the trial court had authority to make an initial determination as to its authority, an examination of the applications themselves should have led it to summarily
                        deny the habeas corpus petitions. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 500 (2020).

                    <p>
                        By the theory of our government, appointments to office are presumed to be made solely upon the principle detur digniori, and any practice whereby the bare consideration of money is brought to bear in any form upon such appointments to or resignation
                        of office conflicts with and degrades this great principle. The services performed under such appointments are paid for by salary or fees, presumed to be adjusted at the point of adequate remuneration only. Any premium paid to
                        obtain office interferes with this adjustment and tempts to speculation, overcharges and frauds in the effort to restore the balance thus disturbed. Basket v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 448</cite>,

                        Public offices are public trusts, and should be conferred solely upon considerations of ability, integrity, fidelity and fitness for the position. Agreements for compensation to procure these tend directly and necessarily to lower the character of the
                        appointments, to the great detriment of the public. Hence, such agreements, of whatever nature, have always been held void as being against public policy. Basket v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 448</cite>,

                            to raise a presumption of his right, in which cases his necessary official acts are valid as to the public and third persons; but he may be ousted by a direct proceeding. A de jure officer is one who is regularly and lawfully
                            elected or appointed and inducted into office and exercises the duties as his right. All his necessary official acts are valid, and he cannot be ousted. The only difference between an officer de facto and an officer de jure
                            is that the former may be ousted in a direct proceeding against him, while the latter cannot be. So far as the public and third persons are concerned, there is no difference whatever. The acts of one have precisely the same
                            force and effect as the acts of the other. People ex rel. Norfleet v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 546</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS 109 (1875).

                            A mere intruder or usurper is not ordinarily, but may become, an officer de facto in some cases. This can happen only by the continued exercise of the office by him and the acquiescence therein by the public authorities and the public for such length
                            of time as to afford to citizens generally a strong presumption that he had been duly appointed. But when without color of authority he simply assumes to act, to exercise authority as an officer, and the public knows the fact,
                            or reasonably ought to know that he is a usurper, his acts are absolutely void for all purposes. The mere fact that, apart from his usurpation, his supposed official acts were fair and honest could not impart to them validity
                            and efficiency. Burke v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 355</cite>, 1844 N.C. LEXIS 37 (1844); People ex rel. Norfleet v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 546</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS

                            A usurper in office is distinguished from a de facto officer in that a usurper takes possession of office and undertakes to act officially without any authority, either actual or apparent. Since he is not an officer at all or for any purpose, his acts
                            are absolutely void, and they can be impeached at any time in any proceeding. People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 713</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 796, 1978 N.C. LEXIS 1299 (1978).

                            Persons who have been regarded as public officers for the greater part of the time during which the office existed, and whose acts are recognized by other public functionaries, must be taken to be officers de facto. Burton ex rel. Reeves v. Patton,

                            An officer de facto is one whose acts, though not those of a lawful officer, the law, upon principles of policy and justice, will hold valid, so far as they involve the interests of the public and third persons, where the duties of the office were exercised
                            (1) without a known appointment or election, but under such circumstances of reputation or acquiescence as were calculated to induce people, without inquiry, to submit to or revoke his action, supposing him to be the officer
                            he assumed to be; (2) under color of a known and valid appointment or election, but where the officer failed to conform to some precedent requirement or condition, such as taking an oath, giving a bond, or the like; (3) under
                            color of a known election or appointment, void because there was a want of power in the electing or appointing body, or by reason of some defect or irregularity in its exercise, such ineligibility, want of power or defect being

                            A judge de facto is defined as one who occupies a judicial office under some color of right, and for the time being performs its duties with public acquiescence, though having no right in fact. In order for one to be deemed a judge de facto, he must have
                            satisfied the following four conditions: (1) He assumes to be the judge of a court which is established by law; (2) he is in possession of the judicial office in question, and is discharging its duties; (3) his incumbency of
                            the judicial office is illegal in some respects; and (4) he has at least a fair color of right or title to the judicial office, or has acted as its occupant for so long a time and under such circumstances of reputation or acquiescence
                            by the public generally as are calculated to afford a presumption of his right to act and to induce people, without inquiry, to submit to or invoke official action on his part on the supposition that he is the judge he assumes

                        Panel of commissioners was evenly split and no majority existed because when the opinion and award was filed, a commissioner who concurred in the opinion was not an officer de jure pursuant as the commissioner’s term had ended and a successor had been
                        appointed. Therefore, because the commissioner’s appointment was void before the opinion and award were entered, and because the commissioner’s concurrence in the opinion and award was not the act of a qualified officer — neither
                        de jure nor de facto — the concurrence was a nullity. Baxter v. Danny Nicholson, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 661 S.E.2d 892, <cite class="nc_code">2008 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1149

                        The mayor of a municipality was constituted a special court for the municipality by valid act (Chapter 144, Private Laws of 1913). A duly elected and qualified mayor assumed the duties as judge of the special court under claim of authority. By

    Citizen to recover funds of county or town retained by delinquent official.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    When an official of a county, city or town is liable upon his bond for unlawfully and wrongfully retaining by virtue of his office a fund, or a part thereof, to which the county, city or town is entitled, any citizen and taxpayer may, in his own name
                    for the benefit of the county, city or town, institute suit and recover from the delinquent official the fund so retained. Any county commissioners, aldermen, councilmen or governing board who fraudulently, wrongfully and unlawfully
                    permit an official so to retain funds shall be personally liable therefor; any citizen and taxpayer may, in his own name for the benefit of the county, city or town, institute suit and recover from such county commissioners, aldermen,
                    councilmen, or governing board, the fund so retained. Before instituting suit under this section, the citizen and taxpayer shall file a statement before the county commissioners, treasurer, or other officers authorized by law to institute
                    the suit, setting forth the fund alleged to be retained or permitted to be retained, and demanding that suit be instituted by the authorities authorized to sue within 60 days. The citizen and taxpayer so suing shall receive one-third
                    part, up to the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00), of the amount recovered, to indemnify him for his services, but the amount received by the taxpayer and citizen as indemnity shall in no case exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).

                        per year additional, and again in 1939 allowed him $240 more per year, both without legislative authority, judgment of nonsuit as to the commissioners was properly allowed under the express provisions of this section, there being

                        This section does not create an initial cause of action against commissioners, but rather establishes a derivative remedy, requiring both retained funds by a bonded officer and refusal to act by commissioners. The allegations and the pleadings indicate

                        When taxpayers sued county commissioners for entering into a contract which benefitted one of the commissioners, they did not have a claim under G.S. 128-10 because they did not show a public official who was liable on his bond or commissioners who refused
                        to take action against such official, and the existence of insurance coverage issued by the North Carolina Counties Liability and Property Insurance Pool Fund did not provide a bond, as insurance and suretyship were not synonymous

                    Session Laws 2007-388, s. 1, provides: “Notwithstanding any section of law or any rules and regulations adopted by the Boards of Trustees to the contrary, the Retirement Systems Division of the Department of State Treasurer shall allow for an open enrollment
                    period in the Contributory Death Benefit for Retired Members of the Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System, the Local Governmental Employees’ Retirement System, the Consolidated Judicial Retirement System, and the Legislative
                    Retirement System. This open enrollment period shall begin February 1, 2008, and end May 31, 2008. The Retirement Systems Division shall send notice by U.S. mail of the open enrollment period to all retirees who elected not to be covered
                    under this benefit or who failed to make any election at the time of their retirement and shall send a second notice by U.S. mail to any such retiree who fails to make an election within 60 days of the notification of the open enrollment
                    period. Notice, at minimum, shall consist of notification of the open enrollment period and the consequences of failure to respond within the specified time frames, informational materials explaining the benefit program and the associated
                    costs, and a preprinted personalized enrollment application to facilitate the enrollment process indicating each individual retiree’s contribution rate. The contribution rate for retirees electing coverage during the open enrollment
                    period shall be increased by eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) the rate established for retirees who elected coverage when first eligible, at retirement. For retirees electing coverage during this open enrollment period, coverage
                    shall become effective the first of the month following the month in which the election of coverage is received by the Retirement Systems Division but not before February 1, 2008. Contribution rates for coverage shall be based upon
                    the retiree’s nearest age as of the effective date of coverage and shall begin by deduction from the retiree’s net monthly retirement allowance in the month in which coverage becomes effective. Coverage elected by retirees during this
                    open enrollment period shall be subject to all other laws and rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees governing the Contributory Death Benefit for Retired Members.”

                    service during any period of furlough and shall be entitled to all of the same benefits to which the employee was entitled on the workday immediately preceding the furlough. The member shall suffer no diminution of retirement average
                    final compensation based on being on furlough, and the retirement average final compensation shall be calculated based on the undiminished compensation. During a furlough period, the employer who opts for this provision shall pay both

                    who elects to cover its furloughed employees through this provision shall be entitled to include earnings lost due to furloughs taken after January 1, 2009, and before July 1, 2009, in the reported compensation and contributions for

                    A Retirement System is hereby established and placed under the management of the Board of Trustees for the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits under the provisions of this Article for employees of those counties, cities and towns
                    or other eligible employers participating in the said Retirement System. Following the filing of the application as provided in G.S. 128-23(c), the Board shall set a date, effective the first day of a calendar quarter, not more than
                    90 days thereafter, as of which date participation of the employer may begin, which date shall be known as the date of participation for such employer: Provided, that in the judgment of the Board of Trustees an adequate number of persons
                    have indicated their intention to participate; otherwise at such later date as the Board of Trustees may set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Retirement System is a governmental plan, within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, the nondiscrimination rules of Sections 401(a)(5) and 401(a)(26) of the Code do not apply. This System shall have the power and
                    privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the “North Carolina Local Governmental Employees’ Retirement System,” and by such name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, and all of its cash and securities
                    and other property held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistent with Section 401(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, all contributions from participating employers and participating employees to this Retirement System shall be made to funds held in trust through trust instruments that have the purposes
                    of distributing trust principal and income to retired members and their beneficiaries and of paying other definitely determinable benefits under this Chapter, after meeting the necessary expenses of administering this Retirement System.
                    Neither the trust corpus nor income from this trust can be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, except that employer contributions made to the trust under a good faith mistake of fact
                    may be returned to an employer, where the refund can occur within less than one year after the mistaken contribution was made, consistent with the rule adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Retirement System shall have a consolidated
                    Plan document, consisting of Article V, Section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution, relevant statutory provisions in this Chapter, associated regulations in the North Carolina Administrative Code, substantive and procedural information
                    on the official forms used by the Retirement System, and policies and minutes of the Board of Trustees.

                                in any year, as based on compensation, is equivalent to one year of service in proportion to earnable compensation, but in no case shall more than one year of service be creditable for all service in one year. Service rendered
                                for the regular school year in any district shall be equivalent to one year of service.Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service.

                        Credit at Full Cost for Probationary Employment Purchased On or Before December 31, 2021.—  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, on or before December 31, 2021, a member may purchase creditable service, prior to retirement, for employment

                        to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability of the service credits calculated on the basis of the assumptions used for purposes of the actuarial valuation of the liabilities of the retirement system, and the calculation
                        of the amount payable shall take into account the retirement allowance arising on account of the additional service credit commencing at the earliest age at which the member could retire on an unreduced retirement allowance, as
                        determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary, plus an administrative fee to be set by the Board of Trustees. In no instance shall the amount payable be less than the contributions a member would
                        have made during the employment plus four percent (4%) interest compounded annually.Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection that provide for the purchase of service credits, the terms “full cost”, “full liability”,

                        members in its current employ in paying all or any part of the cost of the probationary employment. In the event an employer pays all or a part of the full actuarial cost, the employer may, at its option, pay such amount either
                        in a lump sum or by increasing its “accrued liability contribution” for the remainder of its accrued liability period. In the event an employer has satisfied its accrued liability contribution, the employer may amortize its portion
                        of the full actuarial cost over a period not to exceed 10 years. The expense of making an actuarial valuation to determine the accrued liability contribution or the additional accrued liability contribution, required to amortize
                        the portion of the full actuarial cost paid by the employer, shall be paid by the employer in a lump sum at the time of the actuarial valuation.

                        that member is not entitled to any creditable service that accrued after December 1, 2012, regardless of whether that creditable service was earned by virtue of membership in the System, accrued by conversion of sick leave at the
                        point of the member’s retirement, accrued by transfer of service from another retirement system, purchased by the member in accordance with this Article, or accrued by any other means. For purposes of this subsection, creditable
                        service attributable to the conversion of sick leave accrues in this System on the date of retirement, service transferred to this System from another system accrues in this System on the effective date of the transfer, and purchased
                        service accrues in this System on the date of the purchase.

                        Contribution-Based Benefit Cap Purchase Provision. —  If a member’s retirement allowance is subject to an adjustment pursuant to the contribution-based benefit cap established in G.S. 128-27(a3), the retirement system shall notify the member and the member’s
                        employer that the member’s retirement allowance has been capped. The retirement system shall compute and notify the member and the member’s employer of the total additional amount the member would need to contribute in order to
                        make the member not subject to the contribution-based benefit cap. This total additional amount shall be the actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity adjusted for the age of the member at the time of retirement, or when appropriate,
                        the age at the time of the member’s death that would have had to have been purchased to increase the member’s benefit to the pre-cap level. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the member shall have until 90 days after
                        notification regarding this additional amount or until 90 days after the effective date of retirement, whichever is later, to submit a lump sum payment to the annuity savings fund in order for the retirement system to restore the
                        retirement allowance to the uncapped amount. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer from paying all or part of the cost of the amount necessary to restore the member’s retirement allowance to the pre-cap
                        amount. Notwithstanding the requirement that the payment be made as a lump sum, the retirement system may allow an employer of a member who became a member before January 1, 2015, or who has not earned at least five years of membership
                        service in the retirement system after January 1, 2015, to pay the lump-sum amount required in this subsection on an installment payment plan under one of the following two options:

                                benefit cap liability owed and applied to any installment payment plan term exceeding 12 months at a rate corresponding with the interest rate assumption based on the most recent actuarial valuation approved by the Board

                    Session Laws 1987, c. 617, s. 3 directed the deletion of the last paragraph of subsection (j). However, subsection (j) only contained one paragraph. Thus it would appear that the intent of the act was to delete all of subsection (j).

                <p>
                    Session Laws 1987, c. 617, s. 5 provided, inter alia: “For the purposes of Section 3 of this act, members of the Retirement System who are members before January 1, 1988, shall retain all rights and privileges to purchase military and out-of-state service

                    “Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, members not otherwise allowed service credit for service in the armed forces of the United States may, upon completion of 10 years of prior and current membership service, purchase such service credit
                    by paying in a total lump sum an amount, based on the compensation the member earned when he first entered membership and the employee contribution rate at that time, with sufficient interest added thereto so as to equal one half the
                    cost of allowing such service, plus a fee to cover expense of handling payment to be determined by the Board of Trustees and assessed the member at the time of payment; provided that credit will be allowed only for the initial period
                    of active duty in the armed forces of the United States up to the time the member was first eligible to be separated or released therefrom, and subsequent periods of such active duty as required by the armed forces of the United States

                    service which would be allowable under the laws governing this System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as the result of the service. Payment shall be permitted only on a total

                        Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment awarding a sheriff a special separation allowance for 36 years of creditable service through two North Carolina retirement systems, state and local, because the sheriff was not a member of the
                        state system when he retired where, prior to his retirement from the sheriff’s department, he began receiving retirement benefits from that system, and the sheriff was only entitled to credit for his 12 years of service under the
                        local system where the county never issued the sheriff a prior service certificate, the sheriff never transferred membership of his state service to the local system, and the county never gave the sheriff credit for prior service.

                        The purchase of prior credit service for the period of July 10, 1984 and the enrollment in November, 1984 of several public safety officers would not give those officers five years’ service standing to their credit as of August 12, 1989; therefore, they
                        would not thereby have a right to receive their retirement benefits tax-free. See Opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Ralph D. Karpinos, Town Attorney, Town of Chapel Hill, 2000 N.C. AG LEXIS 12 (10/2/2000).

                        shall also include an administrative fee to be set by the Board.Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service. To the extent that the purchase

                                period. In the event an employer has satisfied its accrued liability contribution, the employer may amortize its portion of the full actuarial cost over a period not to exceed ten years. The expense of making an actuarial
                                valuation to determine the accrued liability contribution or the additional accrued liability contribution, required to amortize the portion of the full actuarial cost paid by the employer, shall be paid by the employer

                        (Repealed effective July 1, 2022) Credit at Full Cost for Federal Employment.—  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter, a member in service with five or more years of membership service may purchase creditable service for periods of federal
                        employment, provided that the member is not receiving any retirement benefits resulting from this federal employment, and provided that the member is not vested in the particular federal retirement system to which the member may
                        have belonged while a federal employee. The amount of creditable service purchased under this subsection may not exceed a total of five years. The member shall purchase this service by making a lump sum amount payable to the Annuity

                        allowance increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary. The calculation of the amount payable shall also include an administrative fee to be set by the Board.Subject to the requirements of

                        accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member’s annuity savings account.On or before December 31, 2021, members may also purchase creditable
                        service for periods of employment with public community service entities within the State funded entirely with federal funds, other than the federal government, that are not covered by the provisions of G.S. 128-21(11) or G.S.

                        determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary, plus an administrative fee to be set by the Board of Trustees. In no instance shall the amount payable be less than the contributions a member would
                        have made during the employment plus four percent (4%) interest compounded annually.Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection that provide for the purchase of service credits, the terms “full cost”, “full liability”,

                        in a lump sum or by increasing its “accrued liability contribution” for the remainder of its accrued liability period. In the event an employer has satisfied its accrued liability contribution, the employer may amortize its portion
                        of the full actuarial cost over a period not to exceed 10 years. The expense of making an actuarial valuation to determine the accrued liability contribution or the additional accrued liability contribution, required to amortize
                        the portion of the full actuarial cost paid by the employer, shall be paid by the employer in a lump sum at the time of the actuarial valuation.

                    the United States other than this State at the rate of one year of out-of-state service for each two years of service in this State with a maximum allowable of 10 years of out-of-state service. Such service is limited to full-time
                    service which would be allowable under the laws governing this System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as the result of the service. Payment shall be permitted only on a total
                    lump sum an amount, based on the compensation the member earned when he first entered membership and the employee contribution rate at that time and shall be equal to the full cost of providing credit for such service plus a fee to
                    cover expense of handling which shall be determined by the Board of Trustees. These provisions shall apply equally to retired members who had attained 10 years of prior and current membership service prior to retirement. Cost as used
                    in this subsection shall mean the amount of money required to provide additional retirement benefits based on service credit allowed at the time any adjustment to the service credit of an individual is made.”

                        Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment awarding a sheriff a special separation allowance for 36 years of creditable service through two North Carolina retirement systems, state and local, because the sheriff was not a member of the
                        state system when he retired where, prior to his retirement from the sheriff’s department, he began receiving retirement benefits from that system, and the sheriff was only entitled to credit for his 12 years of service under the
                        local system where the county never issued the sheriff a prior service certificate, the sheriff never transferred membership of his state service to the local system, and the county never gave the sheriff credit for prior service.

                        The purchase of prior credit service for the period of July 10, 1984 and the enrollment in November, 1984 of several public safety officers would not give those officers five years’ service standing to their credit as of August 12, 1989; therefore, they
                        would not thereby have a right to receive their retirement benefits tax-free. See Opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Ralph D. Karpinos, Town Attorney, Town of Chapel Hill, 2000 N.C. AG LEXIS 12 (10/2/2000).

                        terminated members with 20 or more years of creditable service who are at least 50 years of age, reduced by one-fourth of one percent (1/4 of 1%) for each month that retirement precedes the member’s fifty-fifth birthday.In cases
                        in which a discontinued service retirement allowance is approved, the terminated member’s employer shall be responsible for making a lump-sum payment to the Retirement System’s Board of Trustees equal to the actuarial present value

                        following plans to the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan, subject to the applicable requirements of the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan, and then through the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan to this Retirement System (i)
                        a plan participating in the North Carolina Public School Teachers’ and Professional Educators’ Investment Plan; (ii) a plan described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; (iii) a plan described in section 457(b) of the
                        Internal Revenue Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state; (iv) an individual retirement account or annuity described
                        in section 408(a) or section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includible in gross income; or (v) a tax-qualified plan described in section 401(a) or section 403(a) of
                        the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, any transfer under this subsection may be paid in whole or in part with employer contributions paid directly to this Retirement System at the time of transfer.Notwithstanding anything to
                        the contrary, a member may not transfer such amounts as will cause the member’s retirement allowance under the System to exceed the amount allowable under G.S. 128-38.2(b). The Board of Trustees may establish a minimum amount that
                        must be transferred if a transfer is elected. The member may elect a special retirement allowance with no postretirement increases or a special retirement allowance with annual postretirement increases equal to the annual increase
                        in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Postretirement increases on any other allowance will not apply to the special retirement allowance. The Board of Trustees shall provide educational materials to the members who apply for the transfer
                        authorized by this section. Those materials shall describe the special retirement allowance and shall explain the relationship between the transferred balance and the monthly benefit and how the member’s heirs may be impacted by
                        the election to make this transfer and any costs and fees involved.For the purpose of determining the special retirement allowance, the Board of Trustees shall adopt straight life annuity factors on the basis of yields on U.S.
                        Treasury Bonds and mortality and such other tables as may be necessary based upon actual experience. A single set of mortality and such other tables will be used for all members, with factors differing only based on the age of
                        the member and the election of postretirement increases. The Board of Trustees shall modify the mortality and such other tables every five years, as shall be deemed necessary, based upon the five-year experience study as required
                        by G.S. 128-28(o). Provided, however, a member who transfers the member’s eligible accumulated contributions from an eligible retirement plan pursuant to this subsection to this Retirement System shall be taxed for North Carolina
                        State Income Tax purposes on the special retirement allowance the same as if that special retirement allowance had been paid directly by the eligible plan or the plan through which the transfer was made, whichever is most favorable
                        to the member. The Local Governmental Employees’ Retirement System shall be responsible to determine the taxable amount, if any, and report accordingly.The special retirement allowance shall continue for the life of the member
                        and the beneficiary designated to receive a monthly survivorship benefit under Option 2, 3 or 6 as provided in G.S. 128-27(g), if any. The Board of Trustees, however, shall establish two payment options that guarantee payments
                        as follows:

                                A member may elect to receive the special retirement allowance for life but with payments guaranteed for a number of months to be specified by the Board of Trustees. Under this plan, if the member dies before the expiration of the specified number of
                                months, the special retirement allowance will continue to be paid to the member’s designated beneficiary for the life of the beneficiary, if Option 2, 3 or 6 is selected. If the member’s designated beneficiary under Option
                                2, 3 or 6 begins receiving monthly payments and dies before the specified number of monthly payments have been made in combination to the member and beneficiary, a one-time payment will be paid to the member’s legal representatives
                                equal to the initial monthly special retirement allowance, multiplied by the specified number of months, less the total of the monthly payments made to the member and beneficiary. If Option 2, 3 or 6 is not selected, and
                                the member dies before the expiration of the specified number of months, the member’s designated beneficiary will receive a one-time payment equal to the initial monthly special retirement allowance, multiplied by the specified
                                number of months, less the total of the monthly payments made to the member.

                                total transferred amount, the special retirement allowance will continue to be paid to the member’s designated beneficiary for the life of the beneficiary, if Option 2, 3 or 6 is selected. If Option 2, 3 or 6 is not selected,
                                the member’s designated beneficiary or the member’s estate shall be paid any remaining balance of the transferred amount.The Supplemental Retirement Board of Trustees established under G.S. 135-96 may assess a one-time
                                flat administrative fee not to exceed the actual cost of the administrative expenses relating to these transfers. An eligible plan shall not assess a fee specifically relating to a transfer of accumulated contributions
                                authorized under this subsection. This provision shall not prohibit other fees that may be assessable under the plan. Each plan, contract, account, or annuity shall fully disclose to any member participating in a transfer
                                under this subsection any surrender charges or other fees, and that disclosure shall be made contemporaneous with the initiation of the transfer by the member.The General Assembly reserves the right to repeal or amend this
                                subsection, but such repeal or amendment shall not affect any person who has already made the one-time election provided in this subsection.

                    Price Index to such index one year earlier shall be determined, and each beneficiary on the retirement rolls as of July 1 of the year of determination shall be entitled to have his allowance increased effective on July 1 of the year

                    in allowances shall be contingent upon the total fund providing sufficient investment gains to cover the additional actuarial liabilities on account of such increase. The determination of whether there are sufficient investment gains
                    to cover the possible postretirement increase in allowance shall reside exclusively within the discretion of the Board of Trustees and shall be informed by the findings within the annual actuarial valuation reports. In considering
                    whether to grant a postretirement increase, the Board of Trustees shall take into account both the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index and the record of investment gains or losses during the preceding three-year
                    period.The allowance of a surviving annuitant of a beneficiary whose allowance is increased under this subsection shall, when and if payable, be increased by the same per centum.Any increase in allowance granted hereunder shall be
                    permanent, irrespective of any subsequent decrease in the Consumer Price Index, and shall be included in determining any subsequent increase.Notwithstanding the foregoing linkage between increases in the Consumer Price Index and correlative
                    contingent increases in retirement benefits determined by the availability of sufficient investment gains to cover the additional actuarial liabilities arising from those increased benefits, the Board of Trustees, may in any year,
                    considering an increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, fund a cost-of-living increase in a percentage amount, measured in tenths of one percent (1/10 of 1%), of up to four percent (4%), provided that the Board may use only investment
                    gains to fund such an increase.For purposes of this subsection, Consumer Price Index shall mean the Consumer Price Index (all items — United States city average), as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor

                    If a member fails to respond within 120 days after preliminary option figures and the Form 6-E or Form 7-E are transmitted to the member, or if a member fails to respond within 120 days after the effective date of retirement, whichever is later, the Form
                    6 or Form 7 shall be null and void; the retirement system shall not be liable for any benefits due on account of the voided application, and a new application must be filed establishing a subsequent effective date of retirement. If
                    an applicant for disability retirement fails to furnish requested additional medical information within 90 days following such request, the application shall be declared null and void under the same conditions outlined above, unless
                    the applicant is eligible for early or service retirement in which case the application shall be processed accordingly, using the same effective date as would have been used had the application for disability retirement been approved.
                    The Director of the Retirement Systems Division, acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees, may extend the 120-day limitation provided for in this section when a member has suffered incapacitation such that a reasonable person would
                    not have expected the member to be able to complete the required paperwork within the regular deadline, or when an omission by the Retirement Systems Division prevents the member from having sufficient time to meet the regular deadline.

                        Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment awarding a sheriff a special separation allowance for 36 years of creditable service through two North Carolina retirement systems, state and local, because the sheriff was not a member of the
                        state system when he retired where, prior to his retirement from the sheriff’s department, he began receiving retirement benefits from that system, and the sheriff was only entitled to credit for his 12 years of service under the
                        local system where the county never issued the sheriff a prior service certificate, the sheriff never transferred membership of his state service to the local system, and the county never gave the sheriff credit for prior service.

                        not exceed the higher of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or the amount determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as the limitation for calendar years after 1989; provided the imposition of the limitation shall
                        not reduce a member’s benefit below the amount determined as of December 31, 1988.Effective January 1, 1996, the annual compensation of a member taken into account for determining all benefits provided under this Article shall

                        This subsection applies to distributions and rollovers from the Plan. The Plan does not have mandatory distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to distributions from the Plan and notwithstanding
                        any other provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee’s election under this Article, a distributee (including, after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse beneficiary if that non-spouse beneficiary
                        elects a direct rollover only to an inherited traditional or Roth IRA as permitted under applicable federal law) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible
                        rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. As used in this subsection, an “eligible retirement plan” means an individual retirement account described in
                        Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, on and after January 1, 2009, a Roth IRA, or a qualified trust described
                        in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution. Effective on and after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
                        Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
                        account for amounts transferred into that plan from this Plan. As used in this subsection, a “direct rollover” is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Provided, an eligible rollover
                        distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
                        equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary,
                        or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
                        without regard to the exclusion for net realized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Effective as of January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding the exclusion of any after-tax portion from such a rollover distribution in
                        the preceding sentence, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. That portion
                        may be transferred, pursuant to applicable federal law, to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, to a qualified defined benefit plan, or to a qualified defined contribution
                        plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
                        and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
                        payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a court-ordered equitable distribution of marital property, as provided under G.S. 50-20.1. Effective on and after
                        January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator of the Board of Trustees of this Retirement
                        System, to directly roll over any portion of the beneficiary’s distribution from the Retirement System; however, such rollover shall conform with the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code.

                    Any elective or appointive State official may obtain leave of absence from the official’s duties for protracted illness or other reason satisfactory to the Governor, for such period as the Governor may designate. The leave shall be obtained only upon
                    application by the official and with the consent of the Governor. The official shall receive no salary during the period of leave unless the leave of absence is granted by reason of protracted illness, in which event the granting of
                    a leave of absence shall not deprive the official of the benefits of cumulative sick leave to which the official may be entitled under rules and regulations adopted pursuant to G.S. 143-37 or to which he may otherwise be entitled by
                    law. The period of leave may be extended upon application to and with the approval of the Governor if the reason for the original leave still exists, and it may be shortened if the reason shall unexpectedly terminate: Provided, that
                    no leave or extension thereof shall operate to extend the term of office of any official beyond the period for which the official was elected or appointed. If, by reason of the length of the period of absence or the nature of the duties
                    of the official, the Governor deems it necessary, the Governor may appoint any citizen of the State, without regard to residence or district, as a temporary replacement for the period of the official’s leave of absence. This appointee
                    shall have all the authority, duties, perquisites, and emoluments of the official temporarily replaced. The appointee shall possess all the qualifications required by law for holding the office for which the temporary replacement official
                    is appointed.

                    Any elective or appointive county official may obtain leave of absence from the official’s duties for protracted illness or other reason satisfactory to the board of county commissioners of his county, for such period as the board of county commissioners
                    may designate. The leave shall be obtained only upon application by the official and with the consent of the board of county commissioners. The official shall receive no salary during the period of leave unless the leave of absence
                    is granted by reason of protracted illness, in which event the granting of a leave of absence shall not deprive the official of the benefits of any sick leave to which the official may be entitled by law. The period of leave may be
                    extended upon application to and with the approval of the board of county commissioners if the reason for the original leave still exists, and it may be shortened if the reason shall unexpectedly terminate: Provided, that no leave
                    or extension thereof shall operate to extend the term of office of any official beyond the period for which the official was elected or appointed. If, by reason of the length of the period of absence or the nature of the duties of
                    the official, the board of county commissioners deems it necessary, the board may appoint any qualified citizen of the county as a temporary replacement for the period of the official’s leave of absence. This appointee shall have all
                    the authority, duties, perquisites, and emoluments of the official temporarily replaced. The appointee shall possess all the qualifications required by law for holding the office for which the temporary replacement official is appointed.
