      When the mortgagee in a mortgage, or the trustee in a deed in trust, executed for the purpose of securing a debt, containing a power of sale, dies before the payment of the debt secured in such mortgage or deed in trust, all the title, rights, powers and duties of such mortgagee or trustee pass to and devolve upon the executor or administrator or collector of such mortgagee or trustee, including the right to bring an action of foreclosure in any of the courts of this State as prescribed for trustees or mortgagees, and in such action it is unnecessary to make the heirs at law of such deceased mortgagee or trustee parties thereto.

        Power of Sale Vests in Executor of Mortgagee. —

      </p>
      <p>
       When a power of sale in a mortgage is given to the mortgagee, his executors, etc., upon default, and the mortgagee dies leaving a will under which his executors qualify, the power of sale vests in the executors by virtue of this section and the contract in the mortgage. Scott v. Blades Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 44</cite>, 56 S.E. 548, 1907 N.C. LEXIS 104 (1907).

      </p>
      <p>
       The executor of a mortgagee may exercise the power of sale contained in the mortgage when the deed in terms confers such power upon the mortgagee and his executors. This section was intended to confer the power of sale upon executors and administrators when such power is not given in the deed. Yount v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 520</cite>, 13 S.E. 892, 1891 N.C. LEXIS 258 (1891).

       While the executors of a deceased mortgagee may exercise the power of sale in the mortgage, where there are two executors of the deceased mortgagee the power must be exercised by them jointly.

       If the foreclosure proceeding was not authorized for any reason or if it was irregularly conducted (e.g., the notice was incorrect or inadequate in certain respects; the affidavit of default was based on hearsay), it was incumbent on the mortgagor to raise that issue in that proceeding either by objection or motion in the cause. Douglas v. Pennamco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 331 S.E.2d 298, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3671 (1985).

      The executor or administrator of any deceased mortgagee or trustee in any mortgage or deed of trust heretofore or hereafter executed may renounce in writing, before the clerk of the superior court before whom he qualifies, the trust under the mortgage or deed of trust at the time he qualifies as executor or administrator, or at any time thereafter before he intermeddles with or exercises any of the duties under said mortgage or deed of trust, except to preserve the property until a trustee can be appointed. In every such case of renunciation the clerk of the superior court of any county wherein the said mortgage or deed of trust is registered has power and authority, upon proper proceedings instituted before him, as in other cases of special proceedings, to appoint some person to act as trustee and execute said mortgage or deed of trust. The clerk, in addition to recording his proceedings in his book of orders and decrees, shall record a separate instrument, as required by G.S. 161-14.1, containing the name of the substituted trustee or mortgagee, with the register of deeds of said county.

       In addition to the rights and remedies now provided by law, the noteholders may, in their discretion, substitute a trustee whether the trustee then named in the instrument is the original or a substituted trustee or a holder or owner of any or all of the obligations secured thereby, by the execution of a written document properly recorded pursuant to Chapter 47 of the North Carolina General Statutes. An attorney who serves as the trustee or substitute trustee shall not represent either the noteholders or the interests of the borrower while initiating a foreclosure proceeding. Notwithstanding this restriction, an attorney may serve as the trustee in a foreclosure proceeding while simultaneously representing the noteholders on unrelated matters and others within the attorney’s firm may also continue to represent the noteholders on unrelated matters.

      <p>
       Plaintiff sought a strict foreclosure, which was no longer recognized in North Carolina, and by not pursuing a foreclosure sale, plaintiff was not seeking a foreclosure procedure allowed under either of the foreclosure statutes; plaintiff failed to invoke the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction, and thus the default judgment order, to the extent it ordered the conveyance of defendant’s real property, and the subsequent order of divestiture, were void for lack of jurisdiction.

        This Article and G.S. 1-339.1 through 1-339.40 Provide Exclusive Means of Foreclosure. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreclosure may be by judicial sale pursuant to G.S. 1-339.1 through 1-339.40, or, if expressly provided in the deed or mortgage, by power of sale under this Article. These statutes provide the exclusive means for foreclosure in North Carolina, and it was error for the trial court to provide for foreclosure in any other manner. Wolfe v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 307 S.E.2d 400, <cite class="nc_code">1983 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3280 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale is strictly regulated by this Article,
   
   which requires a hearing before the clerk of superior court to determine four issues. If the clerk determines the existence of each item, the clerk then authorizes the trustee to proceed with the sale pursuant to the power of sale contained in the mortgage instrument itself. This procedure enables the trustee or mortgagee to conduct the foreclosure sale with a level of judicial involvement somewhat less than that required in a foreclosure by action. If the mortgage contains a power of sale, the mortgagee or trustee may elect to proceed under this Article or may choose to proceed under foreclosure by action. Phil Mechanic Constr. Co. v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 325 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3073 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       This Article is not pursuant to judicial action;
   
   the article does not affect any right to foreclosure by action in court, and is not applicable to any such action. United Carolina Bank v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 392 S.E.2d 410, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 490 (1990).

       Because North Carolina has no redemption statute, in the sense that a debtor or junior lien holder has no special right to repurchase property from a buyer after the completion of a foreclosure sale, and instead deals with the power of sale foreclosures within 10 days of a public auction pursuant to G.S. 45-21.27, the government had to rely on the language in 26 U.S.C.S. § 7526(d)(1) which stated that the Secretary could redeem within 120 days from the date of sale, and not the language referring to redemption under state law.

        Exercise of Power in Mortgage Subject to 10-Year Limitation. —

      </p>
      <p>
       While formerly there was no bar to the execution of a power of sale contained in a mortgage of lands, by former G.S. 45-26 mortgages then executed were made subject to the 10-year statute. Jenkins v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 184</cite>, 95 S.E. 166, 1918 N.C. LEXIS 29 (1918).

       The holding in Cone v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 810</cite>, 44 S.E. 678 (1903) that the power of sale in a deed of trust or mortgage was not barred by the statute of limitation, though an action for foreclosure thereon was barred, was changed by former G.S. 45-26. Lester Piano Co. v. Loven, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 96</cite>, 176 S.E. 290, 1934 N.C. LEXIS 389 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of G.S. 1-47(3), relating to the bar of actions to foreclose mortgages of real property, were required to be read into former G.S. 45-26; and it appears that a power of sale contained in a mortgage becomes inoperative and unenforceable when not exercised within 10 years after the forfeiture of the mortgage, or after the power of sale becomes absolute, or within 10 years after the last payment on the same “where the mortgagor or grantor has been in possession of the property.” Ownbey v. Parkway Properties, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 54</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 900, 1942 N.C. LEXIS 20 (1942).

      <p>
       Where notes secured by a mortgage were barred by the statute of limitations, and the power of sale contained in the instrument was barred by the lapse of over 10 years from the date of the last payment on the notes, the trustee’s contention that the mortgagor would have to pay the amount of the notes in order to be entitled to the equitable relief of restraining the foreclosure, on the principle that he who seeks equity must do equity, was unavailing.

       Court of Appeals erred in affirming an order dismissing a bank’s judicial foreclosure action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because it applied the requirements applicable to non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale, and not the notice-pleading standard applicable to judicial foreclosures, the bank adequately pled its claim for judicial foreclosure and provided adequate notice of the claim, the bank’s attachment of additional exhibits in support of its claim did not deprive borrower of adequate notice of foreclosure by judicial action, and the absence of an endorsement did not deprive the bank of the right to enforce the instrument.

      <p>
       Order granting bank’s motion to lift the stay of foreclosure proceedings against an owner was proper because the foreclosure action was not a compulsory counterclaim in a separate federal action. G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 13(a) did not compel the bank to pursue its foreclosure in the federal action; pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S § 2072, Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a) did not apply to the bank’s foreclosure by power of sale and thus, did not require the bank to file the foreclosure action as a compulsory counterclaim in the federal action. The notice and hearing provisions in G.S. 45-21.16 do not alter the contractual nature of a foreclosure by power of sale in North Carolina.

The owners should have raised their right to arbitrate in a motion to enjoin pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, which granted the trial court statutory authority and jurisdiction to issue a stay and enforce the arbitration agreement contained in the deed of trust.

       This section allows service upon a party by posting the notice only in those instances where the party’s name and address are not reasonably ascertainable; otherwise, posting will suffice only when “supplemented” by notice mailed to the party’s last known address or by personal service.

       Under this section, service by posting may run concurrently with any other effort to effect service; therefore, when the notice was posted on the property concurrent with the attempt to serve defendants by mail, the notice requirement was satisfied.

       Mortgagor was properly served with process by posting because such service was proper when service by publication, under G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ.

       If a trustee owed a fiduciary duty to the subordinate lienholder, the trustee conceivably would be compelled to give the subordinate lienholder notice of the foreclosure sale so that the subordinate lienholder could enforce its rights, and this result is appropriate because it is incumbent upon a subordinate lienholder to contemplate the risk associated with subordinating its right to payment to that of a higher priority lienholder; the subordinate lienholder is not left without recourse because it has an adequate means to compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the debt, and therefore, in the context of a foreclosure sale, only a foreclosing lienholder may bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the trustee of a deed of trust being foreclosed upon.

       This section does not prohibit an assignment or negotiation of the debt instrument during the interval between the date notice is issued and the time of the hearing, and it is silent as to whether additional notification is necessary when an assignment takes place.

        Second Proceeding Set Aside Where Debt Satisfied in Prior Proceeding. —

      <p>
       The mortgage indebtedness that a substitute trustee sought to collect in a foreclosure proceeding instituted in Davidson County, upon a tract of land located partly in Davidson and Randolph counties, was paid off in full during a prior foreclosure in Randolph County. Thus, this second foreclosure was without foundation and the order of the trial court authorizing the foreclosure was set aside. In re Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C.

      <p>
       The 30-day grace period contained in the original promissory note was contained in the clause governing the lender’s right to accelerate the debt, and the loan modification agreement contained a new acceleration clause, which provided that the lender could accelerate the debt in the event one monthly payment became “delinquent.” The judge properly gave the word “delinquent” its plain meaning, i.e., overdue or late. Consequently, it was clear that the debtor became delinquent in making his payment one day after the agreement provided it was due. In re Fortescue, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C.

      <p>
       Mortgagors, by joining in consent order,
   
   not only waived their right to appeal from final adjudication based thereon, but also left the case with no unresolved issue to appeal, even though their appeal to the judge was not from the consent order but from the clerk’s follow-up order authorizing foreclosure, since the consent order established that the foreclosure issue would be finally set at rest by the subsequent order, and the parties, in effect, agreed and consented to the subsequent order as well.

       This section governs only the bond covering the appeal from the clerk to the trial court; bonds for appeals from the traditional trial courts to the Court of Appeals in foreclosure actions are governed by G.S. 1-292.

      </p>
      <p>
       In foreclosure proceedings a clerk may require a bond by an appealing respondent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and a superior court judge may require a bond upon appeal from that court pursuant to G.S. 1-292, and if the bond is not posted, the trustee may proceed with the foreclosure; however, neither statute gives the clerk or the judge the power to make the posting of a bond a condition to the appeal, and it is error for the superior court to dismiss an appeal from that court when the bond required by the court is not posted.

      <p>
       With respect to debtors’ objection to creditors’ secured claim, res judicata did not bar debtors from litigating validity of Note and Deed of Trust underlying claim because state court foreclosure judgment was on appeal, meaning that judgment was not final, and failure to post bond did not affect validity of appeal.

       Nonjudicial foreclosure sale of property for failure to make payments under a promissory note was authorized, under a reverse mortgage, based on the power-of-sale provision in a deed of trust, because, although the borrower’s widow signed the deed of trust as a borrower, the terms of the borrower’s note and loan agreement, in conjunction with the widow’s statutory ineligibility to qualify as a reverse-mortgage borrower, excluded the widow as a surviving borrower as contemplated by the deed of trust’s acceleration provision.

       The clerk shall order the hearing continued if the clerk finds that there is good cause to believe that additional time or additional measures have a reasonable likelihood of resolving the delinquency without foreclosure. In determining whether to continue the hearing, the clerk may consider (i) whether the mortgagee, trustee, or loan servicer has offered the debtor an opportunity to resolve the foreclosure through forbearance, loan modification, or other commonly accepted resolution plan appropriate under the circumstances, (ii) whether the mortgagee, trustee, or loan servicer has engaged in actual responsive communication with the debtor, including telephone conferences or in-person meetings with the debtor or other actual two-party communications, (iii) whether the debtor has indicated that he or she has the intent and ability to resolve the delinquency by making future payments under a foreclosure resolution plan, and (iv) whether the initiation or continuance of good faith voluntary resolution efforts between the parties may resolve the matter without a foreclosure sale. Where good cause exists to continue the hearing, the clerk shall order the hearing continued to a date and time certain not more than 60 days from the date scheduled for the original hearing.

       For case holding the statutes providing procedure for real property mortgage foreclosure, sale, and eviction under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 unconstitutional as applied, see Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreclosure and sale pursuant to the statutory scheme of this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 was prospectively unlawful and void unless the power of sale was determined by the clerk to be a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of due process rights under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, or the clerk determined that there had been adequate and timely notice to the mortgagor, coupled with opportunity for a hearing, before any rights were lost. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

        Minimum Required by Due Process. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       At a minimum, due process requires the trustee to make an initial showing before the clerk or similar neutral official that the mortgagor is in default under the obligation; the mortgagor must of course be afforded the opportunity to rebut and defend the charges. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975) (decided under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk of the court is barred by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV from working a deprivation of the mortgagor’s property without prior notice and an opportunity for a timely hearing, unless it is clear that those rights have been expressly waived. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975) (decided under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975).

      </p>
      <p>
       The principal object in publishing notice of sale of mortgaged property in the exercise of a power of sale is not so much to notify the grantor or mortgagor as it is to inform the public generally, so that bidders may be present at the sale and a fair price may be obtained. Huggins v. Dement, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 187 S.E.2d 412, <cite class="nc_code">1972 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2309, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1071, 93 S. Ct. 677, 34 L.

       By their terms, G.S. 45-21.16 and this section (the anti-deficiency statute) govern only the relationship between mortgagors and mortgagees, and are designed to protect interests in the property to be sold. Contract rights such as those in guaranty agreements do not fall within the statute’s coverage. Private third party guarantors of loans are not required by the statute to give notice to those whose obligations they guarantee before seeking indemnity from them. Any notice requirement in such a situation is imposed by the contract between the parties, not by the antideficiency statute. Boley v. Principi, 144 F.R.D. 305, 1992 U.S. Dist.

       The last and highest bidder at a foreclosure sale of a mortgage on lands is but a proposed purchaser acquiring no right until the statutory provision of 10 days has expired, and the payment of the full mortgage indebtedness to the mortgagee within that time cancels the instrument and all rights arising thereunder.

       The one who is the last and highest bidder at the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust on lands is but a proposed purchaser within the 10 days before confirmation, and where the mortgagee has become such purchaser and within the 10 days allowed by statute for an increase bid a third person pays the mortgage debt and has the notes and mortgage assigned to him, such person has the right of lien and foreclosure under the terms of the mortgage securing the note.

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Upset Period. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C.S. § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code has the effect of preventing the expiration of the 10-day upset bid period provided for in G.S. 45-21.22, when the debtor files for bankruptcy within that period, thereby preventing the fixing of any rights as to any subject real property protected by a stay as the upset bid period has not run; therefore, where a first mortgagee was the last and highest bidder of a foreclosure trustee’s public sale of the debtors’ property but the debtors filed for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> bankruptcy and stayed the foreclosure, the sale could not be completed and no parties rights as to the property under the foreclosure action were yet “fixed” under G.S. 45-21.27.

      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor retained its rights in real property when it filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition during the 10-day upset bid period of G.S. 45-21.27, subject to a lifting of the stay under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(d). Under G.S. 45-21.22(c), a lift of stay effectively nullified the original foreclosure sale, making it necessary for the trustee to resell the property; thus, because North Carolina law no longer fixed the period within which the debtor had to cure its default, 11 U.S.C.S. § 108(b) inapplicable.

       If a bankruptcy petition is filed (1) after the notice and hearing provided for in G.S. 45-21.16 has been completed and (2) after the clerk of superior court has authorized the foreclosure and (3) prior to the expiration of the upset bid period, then if the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C.S. § 362 is subsequently lifted with respect to the foreclosure, the foreclosing trustee need not comply with the notice and hearing procedure again, but, pursuant to G.S. 45-21.22(c), may proceed to readvertise the property and sell it in accordance with G.S. 45-21.1 and G.S. 45-21.17A; thus, where the debtors filed for an automatic stay after a mortgagee had started foreclosure proceedings but before the 10 day upset period, once the stay was annulled by the bankruptcy judge, the foreclosing trustee was required to pursue foreclosure again by readvertising and selling the property in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 45-21.16A, 45-21.17, and 45-21.17A.

       Whether by stating that the temporary restraining order was “dissolved” or by denying the motion for a preliminary injunction, the state court judge effectively “dissolved an order restraining or enjoining the sale” and he should have set a new sale date and period for notice. G.S 45-21.22(b) (and, similarly, G.S. 45.21.22(c), which applies when a bankruptcy petition is filed during the upset bid period and the automatic stay is subsequently terminated) contemplates that a new sale will be conducted with some notice period, not that the upset bid period will resume for whatever time was remaining when the injunction was entered, after an injunction is issued and dissolved; here, because no new sale date was set, the property was still owned by debtor.

       An upset bid is an advanced, increased, or raised bid whereby any person offers to purchase real property theretofore sold, for an amount exceeding the reported sale price or last upset bid by a minimum of five percent (5%) thereof, but in any event with a minimum increase of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, an upset bid shall be made by delivering to the clerk of superior court, with whom the report of sale or last notice of upset bid was filed, a deposit in cash or by certified check or cashier’s check satisfactory to the clerk in an amount greater than or equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the upset bid but in no event less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). The deposit required by this section shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court, with whom the report of the sale or the last notice of upset bid was filed by the close of normal business hours on the tenth day after the filing of the report of the sale or the last notice of upset bid, and if the tenth day shall fall upon a Sunday or legal holiday when the courthouse is closed for transactions, or upon a day in which the office of the clerk is not open for the regular dispatch of its business, the deposit may be made and the notice of upset bid filed on the day following when said office is open for the regular dispatch of its business. Subject to the provisions of G.S. 45-21.30, there shall be no resales; rather, there may be successive upset bids each of which shall be followed by a period of 10 days for a further upset bid. When an upset bid is not filed following a sale, resale, or prior upset bid within the time specified, the rights of the parties to the sale or resale become fixed.

The compliance bond shall be in such amount as the clerk deems adequate, but in no case greater than the amount of the bid of the person being required to furnish the bond, less the amount of any required deposit. The compliance bond shall be payable to the State of North Carolina for the use of the parties in interest and shall be conditioned on the principal obligor’s compliance with the bid.

      </p>
      <p>
       Former G.S. 45-28 was intended for the protection of mortgagors where sales were made under a power of sale without a decree of foreclosure by the court. In the latter cases there was always an equity to decree a resale when a substantial raise in the bid, usually 10%, had been deposited in court. There being no such protection as to mortgages with power of sale, this statute was passed to extend to mortgagors, whose property had been sold under power of sale without a decree of foreclosure, the same opportunity of a resale. Pringle v. Winston-Salem Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 316</cite>, 108 S.E. 914, 108 S.E. 917, 1921 N.C. LEXIS 223 (1921).

       The supervisory powers invested in the clerk of the court over sales under a mortgage, deed of trust, etc., by former G.S. 45-28 were not those of general control as exercised by the courts in case of an ordinary judicial sale, but were confined by the statute to sales and resales under the power of sale contained in the instruments, and in accordance with the directions of the statute.

      <p>
       Under former G.S. 45-28 it was held that the clerk of the court acquired supervisory power of the sale of land under power contained in a mortgage or deed of trust from the time of an advanced bid paid into his hands, which continued until after the final sale under foreclosure.

      <p>
       Under former G.S. 45-28 the jurisdiction of the clerk vested at the moment an upset bid was filed with him.

        Statutory Period for Filing Upset Bid. —

      <p>
       This section provides that an upset bid may be filed with the clerk of superior court at any time within 10 days after the filing of the report of sale. Obviously, if no report of sale has been filed, the 10-day limitation has not begun to run. The trial court committed error in ordering the substitute trustee to convey the properties in accordance with the foreclosure proceedings thus far. The sales should remain open for an upset bid for a period of 10 days from the date this opinion is certified to the clerk of superior court. Carlisle v. Commodore Corp., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 190 S.E.2d 703, <cite class="nc_code">1972 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1999 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance and service of the temporary restraining order on the substitute trustee halted all proceedings under the foreclosure and tolled the running of the statutory period of 10 days for filing an upset bid. Only nine days elapsed between the date of the sale and the date the substitute trustee was restrained. If the report of sale had been filed on the day of the sale, one day of the statutory 10-day period for filing an upset bid would remain. If the report of sale had been filed on the fifth day after the sale, the maximum time allowed under G.S. 45-21.26, five days of the statutory period of 10 days for filing an upset bid would remain.

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay of § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of the ten-day upset bid period. In re DiCello, 80 B.R. 769, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1983 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1987).

      <p>
       Bankruptcy court found that because March 25 was Greek Independence Day and was a holiday under G.S. 103-4(3a), the 10-day upset period had not expired under G.S. 45-21.27(a) when the debtor filed bankruptcy after the close of business on March 25, which would otherwise have been the 10th day; thus the bankruptcy court vacated its prior order granting the creditors relief from the automatic stay.

       Automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C.S. § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code has the effect of preventing the expiration of the 10-day upset bid period provided for in G.S. 45-21.22, when the debtor files for bankruptcy within that period, thereby preventing the fixing of any rights as to any subject real property protected by a stay as the upset bid period has not run; therefore, where a first mortgagee was the last and highest bidder of a foreclosure trustee’s public sale of the debtors’ property but the debtors filed for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> bankruptcy and stayed the foreclosure, the sale could not be completed and no parties rights as to the property under the foreclosure action were yet “fixed” under G.S. 45-21.27.

Under G.S. 45-21.22(c), a lift of stay effectively nullified the original foreclosure sale, making it necessary for the trustee to resell the property; thus, because North Carolina law no longer fixed the period within which the debtor had to cure its default, 11 U.S.C.S. § 108(b) inapplicable.

      </p>
      <p>
       For case holding the statutes providing procedure for real property mortgage foreclosure, sale, and eviction under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 are unconstitutional as applied, see Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreclosure and sale pursuant to the statutory scheme of this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 was prospectively unlawful and void unless the power of sale was determined by the clerk to be a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of due process rights under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, or the clerk determined that there had been adequate and timely notice to the mortgagor, coupled with opportunity for a hearing, before any rights were lost. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk of the court is barred by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV from working a deprivation of the mortgagor’s property without prior notice and an opportunity for a timely hearing, unless it is clear that those rights have been expressly waived. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

       At a minimum, due process requires the trustee to make an initial showing before the clerk or similar neutral official that the mortgagor is in default under the obligation; the mortgagor must of course be afforded the opportunity to rebut and defend the charges.

       The provision of this section that on the resale of real property the clerk shall make all such orders as may be just and necessary to safeguard the interests of all parties extends to orders securing the rights of the parties as defined by statute, but not to orders abrogating or abridging such rights.

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay of § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of the ten-day upset bid period. In re DiCello, 80 B.R. 769, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1983 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1987).

      <p>
       Where, on account of an upset bid, an order for a resale has been entered, it is error 11 days thereafter to strike out such order and declare the sale final, in prejudice of further rights of mortgagors. Virginia Trust Co. v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 372</cite>, 127 S.E. 242, 1925 N.C. LEXIS 320 (1925).

        Inadequacy of Purchase Price. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere inadequacy of the purchase price realized at a foreclosure sale, standing alone, is not sufficient to upset a sale duly and regularly made in strict conformity with the power of sale. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 167 S.E.2d 802, <cite class="nc_code">1969 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1278 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is an irregularity in the sale, gross inadequacy of purchase price may be considered on the question of the materiality of the irregularity. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 167 S.E.2d 802, <cite class="nc_code">1969 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1278 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gross inadequacy of consideration, when coupled with any other inequitable element, even though neither, standing alone, may be sufficient for the purpose, will induce a court of equity to interpose and do justice between the parties. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 167 S.E.2d 802, <cite class="nc_code">1969 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1278 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The order of the clerk to deliver title required by former G.S. 45-28
   
   was merely ministerial in its nature, and its omission, when in fact the trustee had, after complying with all the terms of the power of sale, made title to the purchaser, did not invalidate the foreclosure or render the title acquired by the purchaser as grantee in the deed of the trustee void. Cheek v. Squires, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 661</cite>, 158 S.E. 198, 1931 N.C. LEXIS 408 (1931). See also, Lawrence v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 196</cite>, 116 S.E. 424, 1923 N.C.

       Trial court did not err by dismissing as untimely and moot plaintiff’s request to enjoin a foreclosure under G.S. 45-21.34 because given that no upset bid was filed by the expiration of the ten-day period prescribed in G.S. 45-21.27 and that plaintiff did not obtain injunctive relief by the time that the upset bid period expired, the rights of the parties to the sale became fixed, rendering plaintiff’s application moot; given that the foreclosure sale became final before plaintiff obtained any sort of injunctive relief, plaintiff was left without the ability to prevent the consummation of the foreclosure on the property, since a court could not restrain the doing of an act which already had been consummated.

      <p>
       In nonjudicial foreclosures where no upset bid is filed, the rights of the parties to the foreclosure sale, i.e., the rights of the trustee under the deed of trust being foreclosed (as seller) and the rights of the purchaser, become fixed at the expiration of the 10-day period for the filing of upset bids. It is at this point that the debtor loses his rights to the equity of redemption he had in the real estate. Cooper v. Smith, 24 B.R. 19, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3837 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1982), disapproved, In re Bundles, 856 F.2d 815, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 12271 (7th Cir. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was undisputed that ten days passed after the report of the November 12, 2004 foreclosure sale was filed without any upset bids being submitted. Thus, when this case was filed on November 23, 2004, debtor had no right of redemption under North Carolina law with respect to the property and had no right to cure with respect to the indebtedness of the creditor under federal bankruptcy law.

       As, under North Carolina law, legal ownership of debtor’s property passed to purchaser when foreclosure sale upset bid closed, adequate grounds and good cause existed to grant purchaser relief from automatic stay. In re Daniel, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 4744 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. July 11, 2016).

       Bankruptcy debtor was not entitled to cure a default under a note and deed of trust against the debtor’s real property in the debtor’s plan, since a foreclosure sale of the property was completed under state law regardless of whether a trustee’s deed was delivered, and the debtor’s right of redemption expired before the bankruptcy case was filed.

       Mortgagors’ argument attacking the consummation of foreclosure by power sale proceeding was moot because the mortgagors did not apply for a temporary stay or injunction, pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, on the ground that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to authorize the sale; thus; the foreclosure sale was consummated, and the parties’ rights in the real property were fixed, in accordance with G.S. 45-21.29A.

       Under the provisions of former G.S. 45-28, the last and highest bidder at a foreclosure sale obtained no interest in the land until the elapse of the 10-day period for the filing of an increased bid, and although the mortgagee or trustee might, in fixing the terms of the sale, require a reasonable cash deposit to cover the cost of the sale and insure completion of the sale by the purchaser if no upset bid was made, the reasonableness of such deposit might be determined by analogy to the deposit required for an upset bid, and a demand for a cash deposit at the sale amounting to 25% of the bid was unreasonable.

      <p>
       The deposit required by former G.S. 45-28 was to guarantee against loss in a resale of land under foreclosure sale of a mortgage, and where the clerk of the superior court required of a person placing an advanced bid a deposit representing a 5% increase bid, and in addition a deposit to guarantee compliance with the bid, and the lands were resold and bought in by the one making the advanced bid, and he refused to pay the amount because of threatened litigation, and the lands were again resold and brought a surplus over that of the prior resale, there was no loss occasioned by the first resale, and the person making the deposit therefor was entitled to received it back as against the claim therefor of one holding a note secured by a junior mortgage on the same property.

       Clerk of the superior court exceeded his statutory authority in reducing the attorney’s fees of a trustee because the clerk should have limited his audit to determining only whether the entries in the report reflected the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33; a trustee’s attorney’s fee provided for in the deed of trust is a cost and expense of the sale and therefore, must be paid by the trustee, G.S. 45-21.31(a)(1), and G.S. 45-21.33 does not authorize the clerk to review the distribution of attorney’s fees for reasonableness.

       At a minimum, due process requires the trustee to make an initial showing before the clerk or similar neutral official that the mortgagor is in default under the obligation; the mortgagor must of course be afforded the opportunity to rebut and defend the charges. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (W.D.N.C. 1975) (decided under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975).

        Clerk’s Authority in Conducting Audit. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In conducting the “audit” under this section the clerk is merely authorized to determine whether the entries in the report reflect the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee. In re Deed of Trust, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 455 S.E.2d 676, <cite class="nc_code">1995 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 236 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       During the audit the clerk is not authorized to review the trustee-attorney’s payment of attorney’s fees to himself or herself for reasonableness, as this action would involve an improper exercise of judicial discretion, but instead, the clerk’s audit pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33(a) and (b) is a ministerial act that is limited to determining merely whether the entries in the report reflect the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee in the absence of a grant of original jurisdiction to determine additional matters; as a result, the trustee is responsible for distributing the appropriate amount of attorney’s fees in accordance with the provisions of the deed of trust. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 459, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 27 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk of the superior court exceeded his statutory authority in reducing the attorney’s fees of a trustee because the clerk should have limited his audit to determining only whether the entries in the report reflected the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33; a trustee’s attorney’s fee provided for in the deed of trust is a cost and expense of the sale and therefore, must be paid by the trustee, G.S. 45-21.31(a)(1), and G.S. 45-21.33 does not authorize the clerk to review the distribution of attorney’s fees for reasonableness. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 459, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 27 (2012).

       The fact that a properly signed publisher’s affidavit was not filed within 30 days
   
   of the sale does not invalidate the sale. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 215 S.E.2d 172, <cite class="nc_code">1975 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1989, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 238</cite>, 217 S.E.2d 678, 1975 N.C. LEXIS 901 (1975).

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to this section, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay of § 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of the ten-day upset bid period.

       Although under this section a debtor may still seek to permanently enjoin a foreclosure after the sale has been held, and can raise defenses such as that the right to foreclose was waived or that there was no default under the deed of trust, the foreclosure sale may nevertheless become final without any further action by the lender or the trustee on the deed of trust. Thus, where <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> debtor filed her petition after foreclosure sale had been held, there had been sufficiently serious alterations of the security holder’s rights so that her right to cure the default under 11 U.S.C. § 1322(b)(5) was terminated.

        Proper Method for Invoking Equity Jurisdiction. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The proper method for invoking equitable jurisdiction to enjoin a foreclosure sale is by bringing an action in the superior court pursuant to this section. In re Watts, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 247 S.E.2d 427, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2089 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The hearing provided for in G.S. 45-21.16 was not intended to settle all matters in controversy between the parties, and the appropriate means for invoking equity jurisdiction is an action pursuant to this section. Golf Vistas, Inc. v. Mortgage Investors, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 249 S.E.2d 815, <cite class="nc_code">1978 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2364 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the hearing under G.S. 45-21.16 is designed to provide a less timely and expensive procedure than foreclosure by action, it does not resolve all matters in controversy between mortgagor and mortgagee. If respondents feel that they have equitable defenses to the foreclosure, they should be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under this section. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 284 S.E.2d 553, <cite class="nc_code">1981 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2966 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgagors should not have been allowed to raise their equitable estoppel defense in a hearing brought pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16 as the trial court’s consideration of the defense in that hearing was in excess of its authority. The proper method for asserting the defense was by an action for injunction under this statute. In re Young, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 744 S.E.2d 476, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 603 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       When mortgagors sued mortgagees for not accepting the mortgagors’ late payments and foreclosing, the mortgagors’ claims for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with contracts and business expectancy, and quantum meruit were collaterally estopped because (1) the claims were contingent upon the mortgagors not having defaulted on the mortgages, and (2) prior foreclosure proceedings found the mortgagors’ default, and those findings were not appealed, fixing the parties’ rights, before which the claims could have been raised. Funderburk v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 775 S.E.2d 1, <cite class="nc_code">2015 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 508 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants sought foreclosure through the power of sale, the statutory prerequisites were found and upheld on appeal, and foreclosure was ordered to proceed; although plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment claims were an impermissible collateral attack, plaintiffs’ complaint was sufficient to invoke the trial court’s equitable jurisdiction to argue the equitable grounds upon which the foreclosure sale should have been enjoined. Howse v. Bank of Am., N.A., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 804 S.E.2d 552, <cite class="nc_code">2017 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 672 (2017).
      </p>

       Mortgagor’s claim of “fraud upon the court” failed because, inter alia, the mortgagor did not timely seek equitable relief after rights of the parties were fixed. Wilson v.

        How Equitable Defenses Raised. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable defenses, such as the acceptance of late payments, may not be raised in a foreclosure hearing pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16, but must instead be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under this section. In re Fortescue, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 330 S.E.2d 219, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3604 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in considering an equitable defense to foreclosure in a hearing held pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16, because the debtor has to pursue such a defense through an action to enjoin the foreclosure pursuant to this section. In re Trust of Azalea Garden Bd. &amp; Care, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 535 S.E.2d 388, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1094 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by ordering a foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.16 based on a finding that respondent was the holder of the note sought to be foreclosed and the note evidenced a valid debt petitioners owed; they failed to prove that two individuals who advised them as to their rights and obligations under the mortgage at closing engaged in the unauthorized practice of law so as to render the debt invalid. If petitioners had equitable defenses to the foreclosure, they could be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.34. In re Gray, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 741 S.E.2d 888, <cite class="nc_code">2013 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 57 (2013).

       Application to enjoin a foreclosure sale which remains undecided at the time that the parties’ rights have become fixed is nothing more than a request that that which has already been consummated be restrained; thus, absent sufficient action by a party seeking to avoid a foreclosure sale to prevent the sale from becoming final, any attempt to enjoin such a sale which has not been heard and decided by the date for the submission of upset bids becomes moot and subject to dismissal at that time.

     <p>
      When any sale of real estate has been made by a mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to make the same, at which the mortgagee, payee or other holder of the obligation thereby secured becomes the purchaser and takes title either directly or indirectly, and thereafter such mortgagee, payee or other holder of the secured obligation, as aforesaid, shall sue for and undertake to recover a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor, trustor or other maker of any such obligation whose property has been so purchased, it shall be competent and lawful for the defendant against whom such deficiency judgment is sought to allege and show as matter of defense and offset, but not by way of counterclaim, that the property sold was fairly worth the amount of the debt secured by it at the time and place of sale or that the amount bid was substantially less than its true value, and, upon such showing, to defeat or offset any deficiency judgment against him, either in whole or in part: Provided, this section shall not affect nor apply to the rights of other purchasers or of innocent third parties, nor shall it be held to affect or defeat the negotiability of any note, bond or other obligation secured by such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument: Provided, further, this section shall not apply to foreclosure sales made pursuant to an order or decree of court nor to any judgment sought or rendered in any foreclosure suit nor to any sale made and confirmed prior to April 18, 1933.

       When a bank sought a deficiency judgment, following foreclosure, against a borrower and guarantors, a trial court did not improperly reduce the guarantors’ liability pursuant to G.S. 45-21.36 by allowing the guarantors to re-join the borrower after the bank dismissed the borrower, when a jury found the fair market value of the foreclosed property was more than the bank paid for the property at foreclosure, because the guarantors were only liable for the debt of the borrower, which could legitimately claim an offset pursuant to the jury’s fair market value determination.

       Trial court erred in granting a bank summary judgment in its action against a guarantor to collect the deficiency remaining on a loan debt because the guarantor was entitled to the statute’s defense/offset even though the borrower had been dismissed from the action; the guaranty agreement made no mention of a waiver of the guarantor’s potential defense/offset.

      <p>
       Just as a guarantor may raise this defense, he similarly is entitled to its benefits should it be determined that the property’s fair market value exceeded the purchase price paid by the creditor at the trustee’s foreclosure sale; a guarantor is protected by the provision of the statute that provides for a judicial method of determining the indebtedness, and as the guarantors only guaranteed the repayment of the indebtedness, the amount of the indebtedness was calculated pursuant to the statute, and it was not the type of defense or offset that was subject to waiver.

       Statute simply allows guarantors the right to a judicial method of debt calculation that accounts for the fair market value of the property at the time of a foreclosure sale; accordingly, notwithstanding the waiver language contained in the guaranty agreements, guarantors did not waive their right to the protection of the statute.

       Each partner, though certainly not enjoying the traditional rights of owners, holds a property interest sufficient to invoke the protection of this section.

       Although mortgagors argued a mortgagee violated G.S. 45-21.36 by bidding “substantially less” than the property was worth, the nine percent difference between the appraised value of the property and the mortgagee’s bid may have been “less” than true value but was not “substantially less” than true value; the mortgagee bid $100,000 for the property, the appraised value was $109,000, and the property ultimately sold for $110,000.

        Summary Judgment Inappropriate. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In a deficiency action, summary judgment was inappropriately granted to a bank because an affidavit produced by two debtors constituted substantial evidence that their property was worth the amount of the debt that was owed at the time of the foreclosure. Even though a bank’s appraiser valued the property at the bank’s foreclosure bid (far below the debt amount) and the bank ultimately sold the property for far less than its bid, the debtors put forth evidence regarding the value of the property which was at odds with the bank’s evidence.

       Sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s finding, under this section, that the foreclosed property was worth far more
   
   than the plaintiff bid for it and that the defendant was, therefore, not indebted to plaintiff in any amount. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 530 S.E.2d 581, <cite class="nc_code">2000 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 549 (2000).

        Where, in partial payment for land, respondents signed a promissory note secured by a deed of trust covering not only the two parcels of land being purchased but an additional tract of land already owned by respondents, the language of the statute did not limit petitioners to foreclosure on the land actually sold by them to respondents; this section was not applicable as there was no indication on the face of either the promissory note or the deed of trust that the debt was incurred for the purchase of the property secured. In re Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 380 S.E.2d 120, <cite class="nc_code">1989 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 420 (1989).

        Where a note and deed of trust cross-refer to each other,
   
   and incorporate each other by reference, and only one of the documents clearly indicates the purchase-money nature of the transaction, the other document may be deemed to include the same language indicating the nature of the transaction; therefore, a note which has been executed but not marked as a “purchase-money note” may still conform to the statutory prerequisites for asserting this section as a defense.

        Purchasers of real property who execute purchase money notes and deeds of trust have no personal liability for the underlying indebtedness and the seller’s remedy is to foreclose the deed of trust. This does not, however, render the debtors’ obligations under the notes and deeds of trust any less an “antecedent debt.” Carter v. Homesley (In re Strom), 46 B.R. 144, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6785 (Bankr.

       <p>
        Where the deed of trust covered land other than that purchased from the plaintiffs by the defendants, it could not qualify as a purchase-money deed of trust under this section. This was true because a deed of trust is a purchase-money deed of trust only if it is made as a part of the same transaction in which the debtor purchases land, embraces the land so purchased, and secures all or part of its purchase price. Dobias v. White, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 409</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 23, 1954 N.C. LEXIS 379 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed of trust given by a vendee to his vendor to secure the purchase price of lands other than those described in the security instrument cannot qualify as a purchase-money deed of trust under this section. This is true because a deed of trust is a purchase-money deed of trust only if it is made as a part of the same transaction in which the debtor purchases the land, embraces the land so purchased, and secures all or part of its purchase price. Childers v. Parker's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 256</cite>, 162 S.E.2d 481, 1968 N.C. LEXIS 756 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the promissory note and deed of trust contained language indicating that they were purchase money instruments, this section was not
   applicable to limit petitioners to foreclose on land actually sold by them to respondents; petitioners sought to foreclose on property conveyed under a deed of trust, and this section only prohibits a mortgagee or trustee in a purchase money situation from obtaining a deficiency judgment. In re Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 380 S.E.2d 120, <cite class="nc_code">1989 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 420 (1989).

        Where the underlying obligation represented by note was still valid, and the anti-deficiency judgment statute did not apply because the bank was not a seller/purchase-money mortgagee, the trial court was correct in awarding plaintiff a monetary judgment in the amount of the outstanding debt balance, plus interest and late fees.

A five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty may be recovered by the grantor, trustor or mortgagor, and a five hundred dollar ($500.00) penalty may be recovered by the purchaser of the property from the grantor, trustor or mortgagor.

       Because a successor judge’s summary judgment order was vacated and as a prior judge ruled that an investor’s alleged violation of G.S. 45-36.3 was an issue for the jury, the successor judge erred in awarding a civil penalty and attorney fees to the home buyers for the investor’s failure to cancel a deed in that the successor judge was without authority to make the awards.

     <p>
      You have a loan with (name of lender) secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property located at (address of property).
     </p>
     <p>
      We will be responsible for disbursing funds in connection with a scheduled sale of the property or a new loan that will be secured by the property. A requirement of the sale or new loan transaction is that the property be conveyed or encumbered free and clear of the existing mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      As permitted by North Carolina law, we are sending the (enclosed/attached/following/foregoing) notification to your lender directing that it temporarily suspend your right and ability to obtain credit advances in anticipation of the settlement of the sale or loan. The notification accompanies a request asking the amount that must be sent to your lender to pay your loan in full and cancel the mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan (or, if your loan will not be paid in full, to release the property from the mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan). The information your lender provides us may be inaccurate if you obtain additional credit advances before the scheduled settlement date of the sale or new loan transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      When your lender receives our directive, it will temporarily suspend your right and ability to obtain credit advances. The period of suspension will continue through and including (anticipated payoff date), the anticipated payoff date, regardless of whether the settlement of the sale or new loan transaction occurs as scheduled. The suspension will not affect your responsibility to continue making payments to your lender during the suspension period. You should not attempt to obtain additional credit advances from your lender during the suspension period.
     </p>
     <p>
      You may instruct us at any time during the suspension period to withdraw the credit suspension directive we are sending your lender, and we are required by law to comply. However, if you do so, you may jeopardize the settlement of the sale or new loan transaction because the payoff or release information provided by your lender may become inaccurate.
     </p>
     <p>
      When proceeds from a sale or new loan transaction are used to pay an existing loan in full, lenders typically close the loan account, thereby terminating their borrower’s ability to obtain additional credit advances. You should contact your lender to determine whether you will be able to obtain additional credit advances after the settlement of the sale or new loan transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have questions about this notice or our action, please contact (name of contact person or department) by calling us at (phone number) or writing to us at (mailing address).

       Where creditors recorded a new deed of trust but failed to record the cancellation of the old deed of trust, the court determined in an adversary proceeding pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 506 that they nonetheless had a secured claim based on the new deed of trust, as there was no state law requirement that conditioned the validity of the subsequent deed of trust on the filing of the cancellation of the prior deed of trust; although G.S. 45-36.9 provides a right to sue for actual damages for late recordings of satisfactions, it did not invalidate such satisfactions or subsequent deeds of trust for untimely recording.

       Where the retroactive application of G.S. 45-36.24 would have caused a trust’s lien on property to automatically expire to the benefit of all subsequently acquired interests in the property fifteen years after the maturity date of the trust’s security instrument, the retroactive application of G.S. 45-36.24(b) violated N.C. Const. Art. I, § 19 because the trust’s interest vested before G.S. 45-36.24 was enacted and application of G.S. 45-36.24 would have retroactively impaired the trust’s vested rights. Falk v.

       Although a creditor might be barred under North Carolina law from seeking collection under the terms of a promissory note, which was a sealed instrument, for debtor to defeat the creditor’s claim of a secured interest in the proceeds of the property, he had to attack the related deed of trust (DOT) and the lien it secured on the property. Creditor’s lien attached to the proceeds of a sale of the property, as the lien created by the DOT would not expire until 15 years after the note’s maturity date, and no evidence was presented that the note was accelerated prior to that date.

       A mortgage can only be released so as to affect purchasers at a sale under the mortgage by a cancellation on the margin of the registration thereof under this section, or by a reconveyance of the mortgaged property duly recorded. Barber v. Wadsworth, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 29</cite>, 20 S.E. 178, 1894 N.C. LEXIS 177 (1894).

       The mortgagee acknowledges the satisfaction and discharge of the mortgage in the presence of the register of deeds, and he enters satisfaction on the margin of the record of the mortgage, and this entry is signed by the mortgagee; and this, done as required by this section, will operate as a deed of release, or reconveyance of the land embraced by the mortgagee. Otherwise, the mortgagee must reconvey the land by proper deed. Walker v. Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 259</cite>, 1884 N.C. LEXIS 211 (1884).

       Trustee’s objection to the secured status asserted in a proof of claim was allowed, as the cancellation of a deed of trust not only eradicated perfection but also constituted satisfaction of the underlying debt and reconveyance of any rights that a bank had in property to debtor under North Carolina law. The statute of limitations did not bar trustee’s assertion of his strong-arm powers defensively, as a basis for objecting to the bank’s secured proof of claim; further, the bank’s claim had to be disallowed if the claim would be avoidable, as opposed to avoided.

It was never contemplated that the trustee could by this means release from an unsatisfied trust specified parts of the land.

        Trustee Improper Party In Quiet Title Action. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Substituted trustee was an improper party to join as a defendant in a purchaser’s action to quiet title because there were no statutory duties for the trustee to fulfill, and his participation in the proceeding served no purpose.

       Subsection (c) modifies and creates an exception to the general rule stated in the latter part of the first sentence: that the trustee is not a proper party to any civil action or proceeding involving title to real property encumbered by the lien on the deed of trust or the priority of the lien on the deed of trust; the second sentence, however, provides examples of the types of cases where the exception to the general rule would not apply. Greene v. Tr. Servs. of Carolina, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 781 S.E.2d 664, <cite class="nc_code">2016 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 57 (2016).

      <p>
       “Examples” listed in the statute are cases that do not relate to the foreclosure of the deed of trust or the exercise of a power of sale under the terms of the deed of trust; “matters relating to the foreclosure of the deed of trust or the exercise of a power of sale under the terms of the deed of trust,” refers to foreclosure special proceedings pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16(d) and to actions to enjoin a foreclosure sale.

      <p>
       Trustees are necessary parties to proceedings pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16 and G.S. 45-21.34 because the trustee is the party tasked with facilitating the process. Greene v. Tr.

       Unlike the situation where a deed of trust is involved, there is no requirement that a promissory note evidencing a future obligation contain any reference to the previously executed security agreement. The only requirement is that the obligation be covered by the security agreement. In re Mills, 39 B.R. 564, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5701 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1984).

       Where, under the explicit terms of savings and loan’s deed of trust, the period within which owner’s future obligations could be incurred expired on March 3, 1988, under the provisions of this section the only obligations incurred by the owner that related back to the recording date of the deed of trust were those incurred through March 3, 1988, and the obligations incurred after that date did not have seniority over plaintiff’s intervening mechanic’s lien. The agreement later made by owner and savings and loan to extend the term in which obligations could be incurred did not affect plaintiff’s rights under the deed of trust as recorded.

       <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> trustee’s claim that a deed of trust a corporate debtor gave a bank did not meet the requirements of G.S. 45-68 raised a plausible claim with respect to the validity and extent of the deed and was not dismissed; however, there was no merit to the trustee’s allegation that the bank committed unfair and deceptive trade practices, in violation of G.S. 75-16, when it allowed the corporation to carry a substantial loan balance without any repayment of principal, allowed the corporation to make interest only payments after it became insolvent, allowed the corporation to make late loan payments without accelerating the debt it owed or demanding payment, and allowed the corporation to incur more trade debt while simultaneously depleting its assets.

       As a matter of law, G.S. 45-81 through G.S. 45-83, by their terms, require the subject deed of trust to specifically identify the document as an equity line of credit. No such specific language appeared in the deed of trust; therefore, it was not an equity line of credit automatically entitled to priority as of the date of execution. Den-Mark Constr., Inc. v.

     <p>
      An equity line security instrument shall, from the time and date of its registration, have the same priority to the extent of all advances secured by it as if the advances had been made at the time of the registration of the equity line security instrument, notwithstanding the fact that from time to time during the term of the equity line of credit no balance is outstanding. Interest that accrues on the equity line of credit and all payments made, sums advanced, and expenses incurred by the lender (i) for insurance, taxes, and assessments, (ii) to protect the lender’s interest under the equity line security instrument, or (iii) to preserve and protect the value or condition of the property encumbered by the equity line security instrument shall be secured by the equity line security instrument and shall have the same priority as if they had been accrued, paid, advanced, and incurred at the time the equity line security instrument was registered. The accrued interest, payments, advances, and expenses shall not be considered in computing the principal amount that is secured by the equity line security instrument at any one time.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to any equitable remedies and any other remedies at law, any borrower injured by any violation of this Article may bring an action for recovery of actual damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The Commissioner of Banks, the Attorney General, or any party to a home loan may enforce the provisions of this section. With the exception of an action by the Commissioner of Banks or the Attorney General, at least 30 days before a borrower or a borrower’s representative institutes a civil action for damages against a servicer for a violation of this Article, the borrower or a borrower’s representative shall notify the servicer in writing of any claimed errors or disputes regarding the borrower’s home loan that forms the basis of the civil action. The notice must be sent to the address as designated on any of the servicer’s bills, statements, invoices, or other written communication, and must enable the servicer to identify the name and loan account of the borrower. For purposes of this section, notice shall not include a complaint or summons. Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of a borrower to enjoin a civil action, or make a counterclaim, cross-claim, or plead a defense in a civil action. A servicer will not be in violation of this Article if the servicer shows by a preponderance of evidence that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t45a10s45-94ol11">

      The Housing Finance Agency shall review information provided in the database created by G.S. 45-103 to determine which home loans are appropriate for efforts to avoid foreclosure. If the Housing Finance Agency reasonably believes, based on a full review of the loan information, the mortgage servicer’s loss mitigation efforts, the borrower’s capacity and interest in staying in the home, and other appropriate factors, that further efforts by the State Home Foreclosure Prevention Project offer a reasonable prospect to avoid foreclosure on primary residences, the Executive Director of the Housing Finance Agency shall have the authority to extend one time under this Article the allowable filing date for any foreclosure proceeding on a primary residence by up to 30 days beyond the earliest filing date established by the pre-foreclosure notice. If the Executive Director of the Housing Finance Agency makes the determination that a loan is subject to this section, the Housing Finance Agency shall notify the borrower, mortgage servicer, and the Administrative Office of the Courts.
