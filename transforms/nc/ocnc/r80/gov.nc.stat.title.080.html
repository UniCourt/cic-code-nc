        Theory Underlying Trademark Law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The law pertaining to trademarks is based upon the dual purpose of protecting the public from inferior products and protecting the reputation and profits of the inventor for the skill given to the invention of the product. Blackwell v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 310</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS 64 (1875), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 733</cite>, 1876 N.C. LEXIS 177 (1876).

        Common Law Not Abrogated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       State statutes providing for registration of trademarks are in affirmance of the common law. Allen v. Standard Crankshaft &amp; Hydraulic Co., 210 F. Supp. 844, 1962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5666 (W.D.N.C. 1962), aff'd, 323 F.2d 29, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1963).

        Chapter Does Not Deal with Trade Names. —

       This chapter deals with trademarks and service marks and not trade names. Hot Shoppes, Inc. v. Hot Shoppe, Inc., 203 F. Supp. 777, 1962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5894 (M.D.N.C. 1962).

       The remedies given by statutes providing for registration of trademarks are either declaratory or are cumulative and additional to those recognized and applied by the common law. Allen v. Standard Crankshaft &amp; Hydraulic Co., 210 F. Supp. 844, 1962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5666 (W.D.N.C. 1962), aff'd, 323 F.2d 29, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1963).

        Name of Town or Locality. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that the name of a town or locality cannot be exclusively appropriated as a trademark. Blackwell Durham Tobacco Co. v. McElwee, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 425</cite>, 1886 N.C. LEXIS 75 (1886).

        Use of Surname. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a rule, a trademark cannot be taken in a surname, and any one named Bingham could start a school called the “Bingham School,” in the absence of proof of intent to injure, or fraudulently attract the benefit of the good name and reputation acquired by a previously existing “Bingham School.” And certainly there could be no confusion between a Bingham School at Asheville and a school even of the identically same name at Mebane, N.C. Bingham School v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 699</cite>, 30 S.E. 304, 1898 N.C. LEXIS 332 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is beyond the scope of the powers of the State legislature to establish a monopoly in a family name or to confer a patent right in its use. Bingham School v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 699</cite>, 30 S.E. 304, 1898 N.C. LEXIS 332 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       But one may, by contract, conclude himself from the use of his own name in a given business, and the agreement will be enforced by the courts. Zagier v. Zagier, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 616</cite>, 83 S.E. 913, 1914 N.C. LEXIS 178 (1914).

     <p>
      The purpose of this Article is to provide a system of State trademark registration and protection substantially consistent with the federal system of trademark registration and protection under the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1051, et seq., as amended.

        When Relief Granted. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the owner of a trademark can call upon the courts for relief, he must show not only that he has a clear legal right to the trademark, but that there has been a plain violation of it; and where a violation is alleged, the true inquiry is, whether the mark of the defendant is so assimilated to that of the plaintiff as to deceive purchasers. And it will make no difference whether the party designed to mislead the public or whether the symbol adopted was calculated to deceive. Blackwell v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 310</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS 64 (1875), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 733</cite>, 1876 N.C. LEXIS 177 (1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       If it appears that the trademark alleged to be an imitation, though resembling the complainant’s in some respects, would not probably deceive the ordinary mass of purchasers, an injunction will not be granted. An imitation is colorable, and will be enjoined, which requires a careful inspection to distinguish its mark and appearance from that of the manufacture imitated. Blackwell v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 310</cite>, 1875 N.C. LEXIS 64 (1875), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 733</cite>, 1876 N.C. LEXIS 177 (1876).
