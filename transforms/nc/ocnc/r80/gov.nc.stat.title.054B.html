     </p>
     <p>
      “In preparing its recommendations, the Commission shall actively solicit and consider information received from representatives of banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, the State Banking Commission, the Commissioner of Banks and the Commissioner’s staff, other interested parties, and the general public.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any State savings and loan association, stock or mutual, organized and operated under the provisions of this Chapter, may convert into a federal savings and loan association in accordance with the provisions of the laws and regulations of the United States and with the same force and effect as though originally incorporated under such laws, and the procedure to effect such conversion shall be as follows:

     <ol>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-30ol11">
       The association shall submit a plan of conversion to the Commissioner of Banks, and he may approve the same, with or without amendment, or refuse to approve the plan. If he approves the plan, then the plan shall be submitted to the members or stockholders as provided in the next subdivision. If he refuses to approve the plan, he shall state his objections in writing and give the converting association an opportunity to amend the plan to obviate such objections or to appeal his decision to the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-30ol12">
       A meeting of the members or stockholders shall be held upon not less than 15 days’ notice to each member or stockholder. Notice can be made either by mailing such to each member or stockholder, postage prepaid, to the last known address or by the board of directors causing to be published once a week for two weeks preceding such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where such association has its principal office, a notice of the meeting. It shall be regarded as sufficient notice of the purpose of the meeting if the notice contains the following statement: “The purpose of this meeting is to consider the conversion of this State-chartered association into a federally chartered association, pursuant to the laws of the United States.” An appropriate officer of the association shall make proof by affidavit at such meeting of due service of the notice or call for said meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-30ol13">
       At the meeting of the members or stockholders of such association, such members or stockholders may by affirmative vote of a majority of votes or shares present, in person or by proxy, resolve to convert said association to a federal savings and loan association. A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the members or stockholders certified by an appropriate officer of the association shall be filed in the office of the Commissioner of Banks. The said certified copy when so filed shall be prima facie evidence of the holding and the action of the meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-30ol14">
       Within a reasonable time after the receipt of a certified copy of the minutes, the Commissioner of Banks shall either approve or disapprove the proceedings of the meeting for compliance with the procedure set forth in this section. If the Commissioner of Banks approves the proceedings he shall endorse the certified copy of the minutes, and shall issue a certificate of his approval of the conversion and proceedings and send the same to the association. Such certificate shall be recorded in the office of the Secretary of State and in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the association has its principal office, and the original shall be held by the association. If the Commissioner of Banks disapproves the proceedings he shall note his disapproval on the certified copy of the minutes and notify the Commission and the association of his disapproval. The association may appeal a disapproval to the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-30ol15">
       Within 60 days after approval of the proceedings by the Commissioner of Banks, the association shall file an application, in the manner prescribed or authorized by the laws and regulations of the United States, to consummate the conversion to a federal association. A copy of the charter or authorization issued to such association by the federal regulatory authority, or a certificate showing the organization or conversion of such association into a federal savings and loan association, and upon such filing with the Commissioner of Banks the association shall cease to be a State association and shall be a federal association.

    Conversion from federal to State association.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any federal savings and loan association, stock or mutual, organized and existing under the laws and regulations of the United States and duly authorized to operate and actually operating in North Carolina may convert into a State savings and loan association operating under the provisions of this Chapter, with the same force and effect as though originally incorporated under the provisions of this Chapter, by complying with the rules and regulations of the federal regulatory authority, and also by following the procedure as set forth in this section:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-31ol11">
       The federal association shall submit a plan of conversion to the Commissioner of Banks. When such plan, either with or without amendment, has been approved by the Commissioner of Banks, it shall be submitted to the members or stockholders of the association as provided in the next subdivision.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-31ol12">
       A meeting of the members or stockholders shall be held upon not less than 15 days’ notice to each member or stockholder. Notice can be made either by mailing such to each member or stockholder, postage prepaid, to the last known address or by the board of directors causing to be published once a week for two weeks preceding such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where such association has its principal office, a notice of the meeting. It shall be regarded as sufficient notice of the purpose of the meeting if the call contains the following statement: “The purpose of this meeting is to consider the conversion of this federally chartered association to a State-chartered savings and loan association, pursuant to the provisions of the laws of the State of North Carolina.” An appropriate officer of the association shall make proof by affidavit at such meeting of the due service of the notice or call for said meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-31ol13">
       At the meeting of the members or stockholders of such association, such members or stockholders may by affirmative vote of a majority of votes or shares present, in person or by proxy, resolve to convert said association to a State association. A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the members or stockholders, certified by an appropriate officer of the association, shall be filed with the Commissioner of Banks, accompanied by a conversion fee. The certified copy when so filed shall be prima facie evidence of the holding of and the action taken at the meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-31ol14">
       Within 30 days after the approval of the proceedings by the Commissioner of Banks, the association shall file with the Commissioner of Banks, the Secretary of State, and the register of deeds of the county where such association intends to operate a copy of the certificate of incorporation of such association, signed by at least seven directors. The certificate of incorporation shall conform to the provisions of the laws of this State. The Secretary of State and the register of deeds of the county where the association has its principal office shall not issue or record the certificate of incorporation until authorized to do so by the Commissioner of Banks. Upon receipt of a copy of the certificate of incorporation the Commissioner of Banks shall cause to be made a careful examination and investigation of the facts connected with the conversion of the association, including an examination of its affairs generally and a determination of its assets and liabilities. The reasonable cost and expenses of the examination and investigation shall be paid by the association. If it appears that the association, if converted, will lawfully be entitled to conduct business as a State association pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, the Commissioner of Banks shall so certify to the Secretary of State and the register of deeds in the county in which the association is located, who shall thereupon issue and record such certificate of incorporation. Upon issuance and recordation of the certificate of incorporation the association shall file with the appropriate federal regulatory authority a certified copy of same. Upon such filing, the association shall cease to be a federal association and shall be converted to a State association.

The reasonable cost and expenses of such examination shall be defrayed by each association so investigated and examined. If, as a result of such investigation, he shall conclude that the members or stockholders of each of the associations proposing to merge will be benefited thereby, he shall, in writing, approve same. If he deems that the proposed merger will not be in the interest of all members or stockholders of the associations so merging, he shall, in writing, disapprove the same.

Upon the adoption of the resolution, a copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the meetings of the members or stockholders of the respective associations, certified by the president or vice-president and secretary or assistant secretary of the merging associations, shall be filed in the office of the Commissioner of Banks. Within 15 days after the receipt of a certified copy of the minutes of such meetings the Commissioner of Banks shall either approve or disapprove the proceedings for compliance with this section. If the proceedings are approved by him, he shall issue a certificate of his approval of the merger and send it to each of the associations. The certificate shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State.

Within 60 days after its receipt from the Secretary of State, the certified copy of the certificate shall be filed with the register of deeds of the county or counties in which the respective associations so merged have recorded their original certificates of incorporation. Failure to so file shall only subject the association to a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to be collected by the Secretary of State. The only fees that shall be collected in connection with the merger of the associations shall be filing and recording fees. If the Commissioner of Banks disapproves the proceedings, he shall mark the certified copies of the meetings in his office as disapproved and notify the associations to that effect. Such disapproval may be appealed by the association to the Commission.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1a">
       Any bank, as defined in G.S. 53C-1-4(4), may convert to a stock association as provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1b">
       Any bank, upon a majority vote of its board of directors, may apply to the Commissioner of Banks for permission to convert to a stock association and for certification of appropriate amendments to the bank’s certificate of incorporation to effect the conversion.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1c">
       The bank shall submit a plan of conversion as a part of the application to the Commissioner of Banks. The Commissioner of Banks may recommend approval of the plan of conversion with or without amendment. The Commissioner of Banks shall recommend approval of the plan of conversion if upon examination and investigation he finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1c1">
         The resulting stock association will operate in a safe, sound, and prudent manner with adequate capital, liquidity, and earnings prospects;
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1c2">
         The directors, officers, and other managerial officials of the bank are qualified by character and financial responsibility to control and operate in a legal and proper manner the stock association proposed to be formed as a result of the conversion;
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1c3">
         The interest of the depositors, the creditors, and the public generally will not be jeopardized by the proposed conversion; and
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1c4">
         The proposed name will not mislead the public as to the character or purpose of the resulting stock association, and the proposed name is not the same as one already adopted or appropriated by an existing association in this State or so similar as to be likely to mislead the public.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1d">
       Any action taken by the Commissioner of Banks pursuant to this section shall be subject to review by the Commission which may approve, modify, or disapprove any action taken or recommended by the Commissioner of Banks. The Commission may promulgate rules to govern conversions undertaken pursuant to this section. The requirements for a converting bank shall be no more stringent than those provided by rule or regulation applicable to other FDIC-insured stock associations. The requirements for a converting bank shall be no less stringent than those provided by rule or regulation applicable to other FDIC-insured stock associations, except as may be allowed during transition periods permitted by subdivisions (e)(4) and (h)(2) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1e">
       In the absence of the promulgation of rules under subsection (d), the conditions to be met for approval of the application for conversion should include the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1e1">
         Condition. The applicant’s general condition must reflect adequate capital, liquidity, reserves, earnings, and asset composition necessary for safe and sound operation of the resulting stock association.
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1e2">
         Management. The management and the board of directors must be capable of supervising a sound stock association operation and overseeing the changes that must be accomplished in the conversion from a bank to a stock association.
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1e3">
         Public Convenience. The Commission must determine that the conversion will have a positive impact on the convenience of the public and will not substantially reduce the services available to the public in the market area.
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1e4">
         Transition. Within a reasonable time after the effective date of the conversion, the resulting stock association must divest itself of all assets and liabilities that do not conform to State banking law or rules. The length of this transition period shall be determined by the Commissioner of Banks and shall be specified when the application for conversion is approved.In evaluating each of these conditions, the Commission shall consider a comparison of the relevant financial ratios of the applicant with the average ratios of North Carolina stock associations of similar asset size. The Commission may not approve a conversion where the applicant presents an undue supervisory concern or has not been operated in a safe and sound manner.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1f">
       If the Commissioner of Banks approves the plan of conversion, then the bank shall submit the plan to the stockholders as provided in subsection (g). After approval of the plan of conversion, the Commissioner of Banks shall supervise and monitor the conversion process and shall ensure that the conversion is conducted pursuant to law and the bank’s approved plan of conversion.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1g">
       After lawful notice to the stockholders of the bank and full and fair disclosure of the plan of conversion, the plan must be approved by a majority of the total votes that stockholders of the bank are eligible and entitled to cast. The vote by the stockholders may be in person or by proxy. Following the vote of the stockholders, the bank shall file with the Commissioner of Banks the results of the vote certified by an appropriate officer of the bank. The Commissioner of Banks shall approve the requested conversion and the bank shall file with the Secretary of State amended articles of incorporation with the certificate of the Commissioner of Banks attached. The conversion of the bank to a stock association shall be effective upon this filing.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1h">
       The Commissioner of Banks may authorize the resulting stock association to do the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1h1">
         Wind up any activities legally engaged in by the bank at the time of conversion but not permitted to stock associations.
        </li>
        <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1h2">
         Retain for a transitional period any assets and deposit liabilities legally held by the bank at the effective date of the conversion that may not be held by stock associations.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba03s54B-46ol1i">
       Upon conversion of a bank to a stock association, the legal existence of the bank does not terminate, and the resulting stock association is a continuation of the bank. The conversion shall be a mere change in identity or form of organization. All rights, liabilities, obligations, interest, and relations of whatever kind of the bank shall continue and remain in the resulting stock association. Except as may be authorized during a transitional period by the Commissioner of Banks pursuant to subsection (h), a stock association resulting from the conversion of a bank shall have only those rights, powers, and duties which are authorized for stock associations by the laws of this State and the United States. All actions and legal proceedings to which the bank was a party prior to conversion shall be unaffected by the conversion and proceed as if the conversion had not taken place.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The length, terms, and conditions of the transitional periods under subdivisions (1) and (2) are subject to the discretion of the Commissioner of Banks, but may not exceed five years after the effective date of the conversion.

       Whenever the Commissioner of Banks determines that an association is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner or in any fashion which threatens the financial integrity or sound operation of the association, the Commissioner of Banks may serve a notice of charges on the association, requiring it to show cause why it should not be placed under supervisory control. Such notice of charges shall specify the grounds for supervisory control, and set the time and place for a hearing. A hearing before the Commission pursuant to such notice shall be held within 15 days after issuance of the notice of charges, and shall comply with the provisions of Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.

       Within 180 days of the date the order taking supervisory control becomes final, the Commissioner of Banks shall issue an order approving a plan for the termination of supervisory control. The plan may provide for:

A hearing shall be held no earlier than 15 days and no later than 30 days after the notice of charges is served, and it shall comply with the provisions of Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.

Such an order shall state its duration on its face and the words, “Temporary Order of Removal,” and shall be effective upon issuance, for a period of 15 days, and may be extended once for a period of 15 days.

       An association shall maintain a blanket indemnity bond of at least a minimum amount as prescribed by the Commissioner of Banks.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba05s54B-109ol1b">
       An association which employs collection agents, who for any reason are not covered by the bond as hereinabove required, shall provide for the bonding of each such agent in an amount equal to at least twice the average monthly collections of such agent. Such agents shall be required to make settlement with the association at least once monthly. No such coverage by bond will be required of any agent which is a federally insured depository institution. The amount and form of such bonds and the sufficiency of the surety thereon shall be approved by the board of directors and the Commissioner of Banks before such is valid. All such bonds shall provide that a cancellation thereof either by the surety or by the insured shall not become effective unless and until 30 days’ notice in writing shall have been given to the Commissioner of Banks.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba05s54B-109ol1c">
       The Commissioner of Banks may require every member of the board of directors, officer or employee of an association who shall knowingly make, approve, participate in, or assent to, or who knowingly shall permit any of the officers or agents of the association to make investments not authorized by this Chapter, to deposit with the association an indemnity bond, insurance or collateral of a kind and amount sufficient to indemnify the association against damage which the association or its members or stockholders sustain in consequence of such unauthorized investment.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba05s54B-109ol1d">
       The amount considered sufficient to indemnify the association shall, in the case of an unauthorized loan, be the difference between the book value of the loan and the amount that could legally have been made under the provisions of this Chapter. The amount considered sufficient to indemnify the association shall, in the case of an unauthorized other investment, be the difference between the book value and the market value of the investment at the time when the Commissioner of Banks makes his determination that such investment is unauthorized. Whenever an unauthorized investment has been sold or disposed of without recourse, the Commissioner of Banks shall release such part of the indemnity as remains after deducting any loss, which amount shall be retained by the association. Whenever the balance of an unauthorized loan has been reduced to an amount which would permit such loan to be made in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, the indemnity shall be released. The Commissioner of Banks, in making such determination may require an independent appraisal of the security.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba05s54B-109ol1e">
       The Commissioner of Banks shall cause to be examined annually all such bonds and pass on their sufficiency and either the board of directors or the Commissioner of Banks may require new or additional bonds at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ba05s54B-109ol1f">
       The Commissioner of Banks is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to litigation expenses and other indemnity matters.

The number of and total amount of such withdrawable accounts to be retired by an association shall be determined by the board of directors.

       An association shall give notice by certified mail to the last address of each holder of an affected withdrawable account of at least 30 days. The redemption price of withdrawable accounts so retired shall be the full withdrawal value of the account, as determined on the last dividend date, plus all dividends on withdrawable accounts credited or paid as of the effective retirement date. Dividends shall continue to accrue and be paid or credited by the association to the withdrawable accounts to be retired up to and including the effective retirement date.

       If the required notice has been properly given, and if on the effective retirement date the funds necessary for payment have been set aside so as to be available, and shall continue to be available therefor, dividends on those withdrawable accounts called for forced retirement shall cease to accrue after the effective retirement date. All rights with respect to such account shall, after the effective retirement date, terminate, except only the right of the holder of the retired withdrawable account to receive the full redemption price.

       No association may redeem withdrawable accounts by forced retirement whenever it has on file applications for withdrawal, or maturities which have not yet been acted upon and paid. No association may redeem withdrawable accounts by forced retirement until the maturity of any fixed minimum term which may be required for the class of withdrawable accounts to be retired.
