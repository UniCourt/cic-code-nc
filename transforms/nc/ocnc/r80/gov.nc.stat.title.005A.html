     Official Commentary

   </p>
   <p>
    This Chapter replaces <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes. The Commission deals with the full range of contempt, both criminal and civil, for two reasons. First, criminal contempt is clearly within the subject matter which the Commission was charged to study, and many aspects of civil contempt are necessary to the enforcement of orders in criminal cases. Second, once the Commission began to deal with criminal contempt, it became necessary also to deal with civil contempt since the two are inextricably bound together in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>. The provisions in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5A</a></cite> are not directly drawn from any other statute, but they are drafted in light of Chapter 5 and of the American Bar Association’s standards on the function of the trial judge. This Chapter does not carry forward the provisions of Chapter 5 which grant contempt powers to boards of county commissioners and the Utilities and Industrial Commissions. The application of those powers was sufficiently unclear under Chapter 5 that the Commission thought it best that those bodies either initiate statutes specifically dealing with that authority or that those bodies rely on court orders or criminal statutes dealing with the disruption of meetings.

      Official Commentary
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The establishment of this Article represents one of the basic purposes of the Commission in drafting the Chapter on contempt — to draw a sharp distinction between proceedings for criminal contempt and the proceedings for civil contempt (or “as for contempt”). This Article deals with those matters for which a sanction is imposed purely as punishment. The sanction occurs without regard to what the contemnor will do after imposition of the sanction.

       Official Commentary
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section is based on Section 5-1. Generally this section merely compresses the existing statement of grounds for criminal contempt, including the consolidation of previously separate grounds. Under subdivision (4), refusal to answer a question when that answer is privileged would not be contempt since the refusal would be “legally justified.” Subdivision (5) adds the clause “made with knowledge that it was false . . .” thus engrafting the standard of New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), onto cases of alleged contempt in publishing reports of proceedings. Subdivision (7) does not have a counterpart in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite>; it was added to make clear, for example, that the failure to appear in court at the proper time by one, including counsel, whose nonappearance would interfere with the court’s schedule, could be subject to criminal contempt. Subdivision (9) is new and gives the court authority to step in immediately in cases of improper communication with jury. It is intended to complement the provision of a new G.S. 14-225.1, enlarging the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html" target="_blank">Chapter 14</a></cite> provisions dealing with jury tampering. The provisions of G.S. 5A-12(e) dictate the relationship between the two sanctions for jury tampering. Subdivision (10) is also new and is intended to insure that this Chapter does not reject attempts elsewhere in the General Statutes to make certain acts criminal contempt. The final sentences of this section are intended to effect the same purpose as the final two sentences of G.S. 5-1. Subsection (b) supplements or clarifies G.S. 5A-11(a)(4) by prohibiting as punishment as contempt for a communication which does not pose a “clear and present danger” to justice. Subsection (c) operates as a reminder of the existence of another new provision, G.S. 7A-276.1, which prohibits “gag orders” of reports of open-court proceedings or of records required to be open to public inspection. Especially important is the final sentence of the section making such an order void, thus overcoming the usual rule that a person subject to an order must comply with that order, even though it may be illegal, until a higher court declares its illegality.

        It is essential for an effective administration of justice in an orderly and efficient way that the court possess certain powers to enforce its mandate. A legislative interference to the extent of depriving the courts of these powers is tantamount to depriving the judicial department of the means of self-preservation and cannot be constitutionally justified.

       <p>
        Although contempt of court, in its essential character, is divided into various kinds, such as direct or constructive, and civil or criminal, nevertheless in every species of contempt there is said to be necessarily inherent an element of offense against the majesty of the law savoring more or less of criminality. Therefore it is said that the process by which the party charged is reached and tried is essentially criminal or quasi-criminal. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 503</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 867, 1969 N.C. LEXIS 434 (1969).

        Proceedings for contempt are of two classes, criminal and civil. Criminal proceedings are those brought to preserve the power and to vindicate the dignity of the court and to punish for disobedience of its processes or orders. Civil proceedings are those instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of the parties to actions and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of the suitors. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822, 1954 N.C. LEXIS 575 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Mauney v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 254</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 391, 1966 N.C. LEXIS 1173 (1966); Blue Jeans Corp. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C.

O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370, 1985 N.C. LEXIS 1546 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contempt proceedings are of two classes: those brought to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court; and those brought to enforce the rights of private parties. The former are as a rule held criminal in their nature and are generally governed by the rules applicable to criminal cases. North Carolina v. Carr, 264 F. Supp. 75, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7244 (W.D.N.C. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal proceedings, involving as they do offenses against the courts and organized society, are punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. Whereas civil proceedings, having as their underlying purpose the preservation of private rights, are primarily remedial and coercive in their nature, and are usually prosecuted at the instance of an aggrieved suitor. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822, 1954 N.C. LEXIS 575 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal contempt is the commission of an act tending to interfere with the administration of justice, while civil contempt is the remedy for the enforcement of orders in the equity jurisdiction of the court, and the willful refusal to pay alimony as ordered by the court is civil contempt. Dyer v. Dyer, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 634</cite>, 197 S.E. 157, 1938 N.C. LEXIS 159 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        A major factor in determining whether contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. O'Briant v. O'Briant, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 432</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 370, 1985 N.C. LEXIS 1546 (1985).

        Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing are required.

        The United States Supreme Court has held that serious contempts are so merely like other serious crimes that they are subject to the jury trial provisions of U.S. Const., Art. 3, § 2 and of Amend. VI thereto, which is binding upon the states by virtue of the due process clause of Amend. XIV. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v.

        The maximum punishment authorized for criminal contempt under former G.S. 5-1 and 5-4 was a fine of $250 or imprisonment for 30 days, or both. This made it a petty offense with no constitutional right to a jury trial. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v.

        The possibilities that striking workers adjudged guilty of criminal contempt under former G.S. 5-1 might be denied the right to return to work or might be disqualified from drawing unemployment benefits for as long as 12 weeks were held irrelevant on the issue of whether the strikers were entitled to trial by jury in the contempt proceedings, since the possibilities were no part of the punishment which the court could impose for criminal contempt.

       <p>
        The word “willful”, when used in a statute creating an offense, implies the doing of the act purposely and deliberately in violation of law. The term “unlawfully” implies that an act is done or not done as the law allows or requires, while the term “willfully” implies that the act is done knowingly and of stubborn purpose.

        Where disobedience to process or order is due to circumstances which make it impossible for the contemnor to obey such order or process, he may not be punished for contempt. Thus where the clerk issued a notice to the respondent to produce a certain will which was in the custody of some other clerk, it was held that the order to adjudge the respondent guilty of contempt was reversible on appeal.

The record showed that the inclusion of the “convicted sex offender” language in the consent order was specifically targeted at defendant’s relationship with her boyfriend. State v.

         Refusal to Testify After Having Been Sworn. —

       </p>
       <p>
        It has been uniformly held by the Supreme Court and by courts of other jurisdictions that the power to punish for contempt committed in the presence of the court is inherent in the court, and not dependent upon statutory authority. Without such power the court cannot perform its judicial function. This principle is especially applicable when the contempt consists in the refusal of the witness in attendance upon the court, after having been duly sworn, to answer a question propounded to him for the purpose of eliciting evidence material to the issue to be decided by the court. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1027, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1202 (1967).

      Subsection (b) is drawn from the recommendations of the American Bar Association. It intends to preclude fine or punishment in response to what is essentially innocent conduct although censure alone would still be possible. Subsection (c) makes clear that a judge may change his mind and reduce or remove any punishment he imposed in response to contempt. Subsection (d) makes clear that, although civil contempt and criminal contempt proceedings are distinct, each may be imposed for the same conduct.

       The punishment in contempt cases must be immediate, or it would be ineffectual, as it is designed to suppress an outrage which impedes the business of the court. State v.

        Punishment for Criminal and Civil Contempt Distinguished. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal contempt is administered as punishment for acts already committed that have impeded the administration of justice in some way. And as is the case with all offenses of a criminal nature, the punishment that courts can impose therefor, either by fine or imprisonment, is circumscribed by law. Civil contempt, on the other hand, is employed to coerce disobedient defendants into complying with orders of court, and the length of time that a defendant can be imprisoned in a proper case is not limited by law, since the defendant can obtain his release immediately upon complying with the court’s order. Brower v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 318 S.E.2d 542, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3622 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A major factor in determining whether contempt is criminal or civil is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the punishment is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish disobedience of its orders, it is criminal contempt. Where the purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. The importance in distinguishing criminal and civil contempt lies in the difference in procedure, punishment and right of review. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 369 S.E.2d 106, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 616 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contempt may be of two kinds, civil or criminal, although the demarcation between the two may be hazy at best. Criminal contempt is generally applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve the rights of private parties and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties. Bishop v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 369 S.E.2d 106, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 616 (1988).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court finds that a defendant is in civil contempt, it is not limited by this section to imposing a 30-day sentence for criminal contempt. It can, under G.S. 5A-21(b), order his imprisonment until he purges himself of contempt. Bennett v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 322 S.E.2d 439, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3844 (1984).

      </p>
      <p>
       As recognized in subsection (d) of this section and G.S. 5A-21(c), a person may be found to be in both criminal and civil contempt, although only a single act was committed. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 263 S.E.2d 624, <cite class="nc_code">1980 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       One act may be punishable both as civil contempt and as criminal contempt. This kind of duality particularly inheres in a party litigant’s willful failure to comply with a discovery order. Punishment is not, therefore, limited to criminal sanctions. Willis v. Duke Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 19</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 191, 1976 N.C. LEXIS 932 (1976).

       Defendant was not improperly found in civil and criminal contempt for the same acts because defendant was found in civil contempt for continued conduct and in criminal contempt for past conduct.

        Decision Not to Prosecute For Criminal Contempt. —

       Defendant claimed that his prosecution for failure to appear violated his due process rights under N.C. Const. art. I, § 19, where he was prosecuted under G.S. 15A-543, and he could have been punished for failure to appear under the criminal contempt statute, G.S. 5A-12(a); however, because there was evidence from which a jury could have found that defendant violated either G.S. 15A-543 or G.S. 5A-12(a), it was within the prosecutor’s discretion to decide under which statute the State wished to proceed. State v. Dammons, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 583 S.E.2d 606, <cite class="nc_code">2003 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1539 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 951, 124 S. Ct. 1691, 158 L.

       The fact that a person has been punished for contempt of court is no defense to a criminal indictment for the act constituting the contempt. State v.

      <p>
       Provision in a criminal contempt adjudication requiring defendant to pay $3,150 in damages to plaintiff was invalid,
   
   because this section limits the punishment that can be imposed for criminal contempts to a fine of $500 and 30 days in jail; and damages may not be awarded to a private party because of any contempt, which is an offense against the State. M.G. Newell Co. v. Wyrick, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 370 S.E.2d 431, <cite class="nc_code">1988 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 717 (1988).

       The imposition of probationary conditions under G.S. 15A-1343 and the possibility of early termination under G.S. 15A-1342(b) do not transform probationary or suspended sentences into civil relief.

      This section specifies that only direct criminal contempt may be the subject of summary proceedings and defines direct criminal contempt. The three factors listed in subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3) must all be present before an act can be direct contempt. Subsection (a) also permits the judge who is authorized to punish summarily to defer the proceedings if he choose. The last sentence of subsection (a) establishes the rule that a person be cited for contempt at the time the contempt occurs even if the proceedings are to be held later.

       Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing is required.

       Trial court had jurisdiction to find defendant in criminal contempt because, as statutorily required, the court’s show cause order required defendant to appear and explain defendant’s noncompliance with court orders.

     <p>
      If the contempt proceedings are to be summary, subsection (a) requires that they occur substantially at the same time as the contempt itself. Subsection (b) follows the American Bar Association recommendation that the person charged with contempt be given notice of what the contemptuous action was and an opportunity to respond. This was intended not to provide for a hearing, or anything approaching that, in summary contempt proceedings, but merely to assure that the alleged contemnor had an opportunity to point out instances of gross mistake about who committed the contemptuous act or matters of that sort.

       Summary punishment for direct contempt committed in the presence of the court does not contemplate a trial at which the person charged with contempt must be represented by counsel, and therefore sentence for contempt does not deprive the contemnor of his liberty without due process of law.

       The term “substantially contemporaneously with the contempt”
   
   in subsection (a) of this section is construed in light of its legislative purpose of meeting due process safeguards. The word “substantially” qualifies the word “contemporaneously,” and clearly does not require that the contempt proceedings immediately follow the misconduct. Factors bearing on the time lapse include the contemnor’s notice or knowledge of the charged misconduct, the nature of the misconduct, and other circumstances that may have some bearing upon the defendant’s right to a fair and timely hearing.

       When a judicial official chooses not to proceed summarily against a person charged with direct criminal contempt or when he may not proceed summarily, he may proceed by an order directing the person to appear before a judge at a reasonable time specified in the order and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. A copy of the order must be furnished to the person charged. If the criminal contempt is based upon acts before a judge which so involve him that his objectivity may reasonably be questioned, the order must be returned before a different judge.

       Proceedings under this section are before a district court judge unless a court superior to the district court issued the order, in which case the proceedings are before that court.

     <p>
      This section provides for a show-cause hearing in instances in which the judge either chooses not to proceed by summary proceedings or may not so proceed because the contempt was not direct. Plenary proceedings may not be held by a magistrate or clerk; they must always be held before a judge. The final sentence of subsection (a) responds to the constitutional requirement of Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968), that contempt proceedings be held before another judge when the one citing the contemnor was involved in the act in question. Subsection (f) permits the judge, in addition to using the prosecutor, who traditionally represents the court in contempt actions, to appoint another member of the Bar when there is a conflict of interest. The central example of this would be when the prosecutor himself or a law-enforcement officer with whom he worked closely was involved in the contempt.

       The principles of due process require that before an attorney is finally adjudicated in contempt and sentenced after a trial for conduct during the trial, he should have reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard in his own behalf.

       Summary proceedings are appropriate for punishing direct contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt; however, in cases where a court does not act immediately to punish acts constituting direct contempt or where the contempt is indirect, notice and a hearing is required.

       Although the trial court made numerous findings about defendant’s inexcusable behavior, none of the findings indicated that the trial court used the beyond a reasonable standard of proof, nor was there a finding of guilt; the trial court’s failure to indicate that it applied beyond a reasonable doubt as the standard of proof in finding facts, as required by the statute, rendered the contempt order fatally deficient.

      The authority for taking custody of a person charged with contempt has been unclear. This section is aimed to fill that gap. Subsection (a) clarifies the legality of seizing a person charged with direct contempt and bringing him before the judge. Subsection (b) makes clear the propriety of issuing an order for arrest of a person when the proceedings are not to be summary. A concurrent change in G.S. 15A-305, providing for the order for arrest, makes clear that an order may be used for this purpose.

       This section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the superior court to hear appeals from orders in the district court holding a person in criminal contempt. Michael v. Michael, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 841, 336 S.E.2d 414, <cite class="nc_code">1985 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 4380 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal contempt orders are properly appealed from district court to the superior court, not to the Court of Appeals. Hancock v. Hancock, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 471 S.E.2d 415, <cite class="nc_code">1996 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 463 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because neither the appellant, nor the appellant’s trial counsel challenged the decision of the trial court judge, either at the end of a recusal hearing or in the appellant’s notice of appeal, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the appellant’s arguments. State v. Okwara, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 733 S.E.2d 576, <cite class="nc_code">2012 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1187 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to hear a father’s appeal of a district court’s criminal contempt finding because the father’s only recourse was to appeal to a superior court. Summerville v. Summerville, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 814 S.E.2d 887, <cite class="nc_code">2018 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 405 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the trial court’s contempt order, finding a former husband in criminal contempt for failure to pay spousal support, but not in contempt for failure to pay child support, because it was unclear whether the order was grounded in civil or criminal contempt, the former wife failed to articulate any basis for appealing the order, and failed to present any adequate basis to determine the appellate court’s jurisdiction. Hardy v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite> 687, 842 S.E.2d 148, <cite class="nc_code">2020 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 247 (2020).

       Neither the trial court’s findings in the summary proceeding, nor the superior court’s findings in the plenary proceeding, conducted de novo pursuant to G.S. 5A-17, specifically indicated that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard was actually applied; the failure to make such an indication made the contempt orders fatally deficient. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 596 S.E.2d 846, <cite class="nc_code">2004 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1034 (2004).

       In a domestic relations case in which plaintiff sought to have defendant’s attorney held in contempt for harboring a child for the purpose of resisting and interfering with a court order granting temporary custody to the plaintiff, the charges were in the nature of criminal contempt, and the court’s order finding that the attorney’s conduct did not constitute contempt was not appealable, since the acquittal did not affect any substantial right of the plaintiff. Patterson v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 289 S.E.2d 48, <cite class="nc_code">1982 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 2431 (1982).

       History.

       Official Commentary
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section is based on the Commission’s recognition that civil contempt should be solely a matter of forcing the contemnor to comply with a court order and, unlike criminal contempt, is not a form of punishment. Subsections (a) and (b) make clear that civil contempt is appropriate only so long as the court order is capable of being complied with. The section rejects the approach of the present <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005.html" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a></cite> specifying particular grounds for civil contempt. Instead, the only issue in determining whether imprisonment for civil contempt is proper is whether or not there is a court order which may be complied with. Subdivision (3) of subsection (a), by specifying that the contempt continues while the person is “able to take reasonable measures that would enable him to comply,” is intended to make clear, for example, that the person who does not have the money to make court-ordered payments but who could take a job which would enable him to make those payments, remains in contempt by not taking such a job. In most cases, a person in civil contempt may be held for so long as his civil contempt continues; he holds the keys to his own jail by virtue of his ability to comply. The Commission felt, however, in the case of failure to comply with nontestimonial identification order by one who is only suspected of a crime, that this unlimited jailing would be improper. Therefore, unless probable cause for arrest arises, the person subject to a nontestimonial identification order who remains noncompliant must be released after 90 days. Concurrent amendments to G.S. 15A-279 (the section dealing with nontestimonial identification orders) point out that resisting compliance with a nontestimonial identification order may be used in determining whether there is probable cause that the person subject to the order committed the crime in question. This means that in many cases the person who resists the order for the full 90 day period will become subject to arrest on probable cause, at which time the 90 day limitation will no longer apply. Another concurrent amendment to G.S. 15A-279 provides, however, that a nontestimonial identification order may not be reissued unless there is newly available evidence to support it. In subsection (c), the Commission was seeking to insure that a person could not serve a longer period of imprisonment by being found in both civil and criminal contempt for the same conduct than he could if he had been found to be in only civil or criminal contempt. An earlier draft of this subsection had specified that a finding of civil or criminal contempt did not preclude disciplinary proceedings if the contemnor were a member of the Bar. The Commission approved this policy but felt it more appropriate that it be mentioned in commentary rather than in the body of the section.

         Nature and Purpose of Proceeding. —

       </p>
       <p>
        Civil contempt is applied to a continuing act, and the proceeding is used to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of private parties and to preserve and enforce private rights. Rose's Stores, Inc. v. Tarrytown Center, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 201</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 320, 1967 N.C. LEXIS 1325 (1967); Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 503</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 867, 1969 N.C. LEXIS 434 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil contempt proceedings are without question civil in nature. Jolly v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 83</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 135, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 1031 (1980), overruled, McBride v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 124</cite>, 431 S.E.2d 14, 1993 N.C. LEXIS 285 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section makes clear that civil contempt is not a form of punishment; rather, it is a civil remedy to be utilized exclusively to enforce compliance with court orders. Jolly v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 83</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 135, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 1031 (1980), overruled, McBride v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 124</cite>, 431 S.E.2d 14, 1993 N.C. LEXIS 285 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of civil contempt is not to punish; rather, its purpose is to use the court’s power to impose fines or imprisonment as a method of coercing the defendant to comply with an order of the court. Jolly v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 83</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 135, 1980 N.C. LEXIS 1031 (1980), overruled, McBride v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 124</cite>, 431 S.E.2d 14, 1993 N.C. LEXIS 285 (1993); Ferree v. Ferree, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 323 S.E.2d 52, <cite class="nc_code">1984 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 3959 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts and omissions constituting civil contempt involve matters tending to defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of a party to an action pending in court, and are punishable with the underlying purpose of preserving private rights by coercion. Galyon v. Stutts, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 120</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 822, 1954 N.C. LEXIS 575 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the trial court ordered defendant to either pay plaintiff $400 or serve thirty days in jail for willfully refusing to pay postseparation support to plaintiff, the action was for defendant’s failure to comply with the trial court’s previous order, and it was evident that the trial court was exercising its contempt power to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order. Therefore, this was a contempt order, and it was civil contempt. Thompson v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 735 S.E.2d 214, <cite class="nc_code">2012 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 1311 (2012).

        Trial court did not err by denying defendants’ motions for release from conditional incarceration for civil contempt because its unchallenged findings supported its conclusion that continuation of defendants’ incarceration under the contempt order was not punitive; because the relief was imprisonment, and defendants could be released by performing affirmative acts required by the trial court, it was coercive and thus, civil.

        The line of demarcation between civil and criminal contempts is hazy at best. A major factor in determining whether a contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised. Where the primary purpose is to preserve the court’s authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders, the contempt is criminal. Where the primary purpose is to provide a remedy for an injured suitor and to coerce compliance with an order, the contempt is civil. Blue Jeans Corp. of Am. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 503</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 867, 1969 N.C. LEXIS 434 (1969); O'Briant v.

        Criminal contempt is a term applied where the judgment is in punishment of an act already accomplished, tending to interfere with the administration of justice. Civil contempt is a term applied where the proceeding is had to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to suits and to compel obedience to orders and decrees made for the benefit of such parties.

        Since defendants were already serving an indefinite, conditional prison sentence for civil contempt at the time their motions for release from conditional incarceration were filed, the trial court was not adjudicating an initial or continuing contempt and thus, had no inherent statutory obligation to consider any of subsection (a)’s enumerations; rather, the issue for the trial court was whether defendants satisfied their burden of showing they were subject to release.

        Finding that a husband was in contempt for failure to pay child support was proper because the trial court’s finding that the husband’s failure to comply with the order was willful and that he had the ability to comply or take reasonable efforts to do so was minimally sufficient for purposes of G.S. 5A-21; although the husband was gainfully employed at the time the orders were entered, shortly afterward, he joined a religious community which prohibited its members from earning outside income and claimed that he therefore did not have the ability to pay the order. That the husband’s religious beliefs may have been sincerely-held was irrelevant. Shippen v. Shippen, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 188, 693 S.E.2d 240, <cite class="nc_code">2010 N.C.

     <p>
      Subsection (a) permits the one who has custody of a jailed contemnor to release him without a court order or any formal proceedings, if the custodian finds that the contemnor has purged himself of the contempt by complying with the contempt order’s specifications. This is intended to apply mainly to the situation in which compliance with the order calls for payment to the court. It was felt that this action was so clear that the custodian should be able to proceed on his own. The possibility that a person will be released when a release was not proper was outweighed by the importance of seeing to it that a person did not remain jailed longer than was necessary. Subsection (b) establishes the machinery for a civil contemnor to seek his own release if he has complied or if compliance is no longer possible, but he has still not been released.

       Civil contempt is employed to coerce disobedient defendants into complying with orders of court, and the length of time that a defendant can be imprisoned in a proper case is not limited by law, since the defendant can obtain his release immediately upon complying with the court’s order.

       The contempt order must be vacated if it fails to specify, as required by subsection (a) of this section, how the defendant might purge herself of contempt.

       Trial court did not err in refusing to make findings on defendants’ inability to comply with a contempt order because based on their refusals to perform the attestation purge act, and their admissions that they would refuse to perform the purge act, they vitiated their inability defense; since the purge condition acts did not require defendants to pay a monetary judgment, they could be imprisoned without further hearing, and the hearing was not an initial or continuing adjudication of contempt.

       Proceedings for civil contempt are by motion pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a1), by the order of a judicial official directing the alleged contemnor to appear at a specified reasonable time and show cause why he should not be held in civil contempt, or by the notice of a judicial official that the alleged contemnor will be held in contempt unless he appears at a specified reasonable time and shows cause why he should not be held in contempt. The order or notice must be given at least five days in advance of the hearing unless good cause is shown.

The motion must include a sworn statement or affidavit by the aggrieved party setting forth the reasons why the alleged contemnor should be held in civil contempt.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) draws a distinction between an order to appear for a show of cause hearing and a notice that the show-cause hearing will be held. The Commission wanted to make clear the propriety of a person’s not appearing if he was notified of the show-cause hearing rather than ordered to appear at it. Since the Commission felt that there were some instances in which the court would want the contemnor present regardless of his wishes, the order was left as an option. Application of subsection (b) results in magistrates and clerks being unable to hold proceedings for civil contempt. The Commission particularly intended “a person with an interest” under subsection (f) to include the State, as represented by the district attorney, in a criminal case. Subsection (g) permits, in essence, consolidated hearings for civil and criminal contempt, thus permitting a judge who has begun a civil contempt hearing to continue and find the person in criminal contempt even though he is beyond the reach of civil contempt because of inability at that time to comply with the order.

       In a quiet title action wherein defendants were found in civil contempt for failing to comply with the trial court’s 2004 order not to trespass any longer, and were found in criminal contempt for their testimony threatening to disobey future orders of the court, the defendants were found in civil and criminal contempt on the basis of different acts and, therefore, they were found in civil and criminal contempt for the same behavior in violation of G.S. 5A-21 and G.S. 5A-23.

       Proceedings to hold a contemnor in contempt for violating a no-contact order were in civil contempt because (1) the proceedings were initiated pursuant to civil contempt statutes, (2) the order finding the contemnor in contempt included civil contempt findings and a “purge” clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with G.S. 50C-10 and G.S. 5A-25’s default civil contempt rule.

      <p>
       Where trial court ordered defendant incarcerated, gave defendant the opportunity to purge his contempt by complying with prior consent order and paying certain sums for attorney’s fees and damages, and imposed no other penalty, the relief granted was wholly civil in nature.
   Since defendant was not, in fact, subject to criminal penalties, there was no necessity to examine whether defendant’s rights under U.S. Const., Amend. V were adequately protected during the contempt proceeding. Hartsell v. Hartsell, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 393 S.E.2d 570, <cite class="nc_code">1990 N.C.

       Contempt proceedings are not a form of punishment, but serve to ensure obedience to orders of the court. Therefore it is essential that the alleged contemnor have the means to comply, and that the court so find, before she can be found in contempt. Glesner v. Dembrosky, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C.

       Trial court’s conclusion, in ruling on a motion to show cause for failure to comply with the court’s previous orders, that no showing had been made under G.S. 5A-21 was error, as the trial court was only required to determine, pursuant to G.S. 5A-23(a), whether the information contained in the motion and the record was sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe the contemnor had the ability to comply with the trial court’s order; since the trial court used the incorrect standard in denying the motion, remand was required. Young v. Mastrom, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 560 S.E.2d 596, <cite class="nc_code">2002 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 192 (2002).

       Order declining to hold a father in contempt for failure to pay child support was vacated and remanded for further findings because, while it was the father’s burden to show why the father should not be held in contempt, the could only be so found if sufficient evidence supported each statutory element, and (1) the trial court did not find if the father complied with the most recent order, if the father’s compliance could still serve the order’s purpose, if any noncompliance were willful, or if the father could comply or take reasonable measures to do so, (2) such findings could not be inferred from the trial court’s order, and (3) a mother did not provide a complete record of relevant pleadings or a full transcript of the proceedings before the trial court.

       Trial court did not err in finding father in civil contempt; although the custody order did not set out the details of unrestricted telephone contact between the parties and children, for over three years after the entry of the order, the parties had developed a method of communication and used it consistently until immediately after father’s remarriage, when he unilaterally changed how mother could contact the children and refused to respond to her notifications that she was unable to do so.

       In divorce proceedings, a trial court erred by holding a husband in contempt because the wife failed to comply with the notice requirements of G.S. 5A-23(a1) and the trial court failed to provide any mechanism by which the husband could purge himself of contempt, as required by G.S. 5A-23(e).

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1a">
       A presiding judicial official may summarily impose measures in response to direct contempt by a juvenile when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt. Before imposing measures summarily, the judicial official shall do all of the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1a1">
         Give the juvenile summary notice of the contempt allegation and a summary opportunity to respond.
        </li>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1a2">
         Appoint an attorney to represent the juvenile and allow time for the juvenile and attorney to confer.
        </li>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1a3">
         Find facts supporting the summary imposition of measures in response to contempt by a juvenile. The facts shall be established beyond a reasonable doubt.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1b">
       When a judicial official chooses not to proceed summarily, the official may enter an order appointing counsel for the juvenile and directing the juvenile to appear before a judge in a juvenile proceeding at a reasonable time specified in the order and show cause why the juvenile should not be held in contempt. A copy of the order shall be furnished to the juvenile and to the juvenile’s attorney. If the direct contempt by a juvenile is based on acts before a judge that so involve the judge that the judge’s objectivity may reasonably be questioned, the order shall be returned before a different judge presiding in juvenile court.
      </li>
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1c">
       After a determination is made pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section that a juvenile has committed direct contempt, the court may order any or all of the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1c1">
         That the juvenile be detained in a juvenile detention facility for up to five days.
        </li>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1c2">
         That the juvenile perform up to 30 hours of supervised community service as arranged by a juvenile court counselor.
        </li>
        <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1c3">
         That the juvenile be required to undergo any evaluation necessary for the court to determine the needs of the juvenile.The court shall not impose any of these sanctions without finding first that the juvenile’s act or omission was willfully contemptuous or that the act or omission was preceded by a clear warning by the court that the conduct is improper.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1d">
       A judicial official who finds a juvenile in direct contempt may at any time terminate or reduce a sanction of detention or eliminate or reduce the number of hours of community service ordered if warranted by the juvenile’s conduct and the ends of justice.
      </li>
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1e">
       A judicial official may orally order that a juvenile the official is charging with direct contempt be taken into custody and restrained to the extent necessary to assure the juvenile’s presence for summary proceedings or notice of plenary proceedings.
      </li>
      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1f">
       The clerk shall place a copy of any order or other paper issued pursuant to this section in the juvenile’s juvenile file, if one exists, or in a new juvenile file.

      <li id="t5Aa03s5A-32ol1g">
       Appeal from an order finding a juvenile in direct contempt is to the Court of Appeals.
